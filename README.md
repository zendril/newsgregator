# newsgregator
Curate news from specified sources, feed them into LLM to summarize.

## Language Options for Scraping Code

### Kotlin (User's Preference)
**Pros:**
- Modern language with concise syntax and strong type safety
- Excellent interoperability with Java libraries (can use any Java scraping library)
- Coroutines for efficient asynchronous programming (important for web scraping)
- Good HTTP client libraries (ktor, fuel, etc.)
- Seamless integration with Spring Boot if needed for a larger application
- Null safety features reduce runtime errors
- Extension functions allow for clean, readable code

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem specifically for web scraping compared to Python
- May require more boilerplate code than Python for some scraping tasks
- Slightly steeper learning curve for developers not familiar with JVM languages

### Python (Alternative)
**Pros:**
- Rich ecosystem for web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium, etc.)
- Simplest syntax and lowest barrier to entry
- Extensive libraries for data processing (pandas, numpy)
- Direct integration with many LLM frameworks
- Rapid prototyping capabilities
- Large community support for scraping-related issues

**Cons:**
- Dynamic typing can lead to runtime errors
- Performance can be slower than JVM languages
- Concurrency model not as elegant as Kotlin coroutines
- Package management can be messy

### JavaScript/TypeScript (Alternative)
**Pros:**
- Native browser integration (Puppeteer, Playwright)
- Good for handling dynamic content that requires JavaScript execution
- TypeScript offers improved type safety
- Rich ecosystem with libraries like Cheerio, Axios
- Asynchronous programming with Promises/async-await

**Cons:**
- Less robust for large-scale data processing
- Dependency management can become complex
- Browser automation adds overhead

## Recommendation

**Kotlin** would be an excellent choice for this project, especially if:
- You're already familiar with Kotlin
- You anticipate scaling the application
- You value type safety and robust error handling
- You need efficient concurrent operations (multiple sources scraped simultaneously)

Kotlin can leverage libraries like:
- **jsoup** for HTML parsing
- **ktor** for HTTP requests
- **kotlinx.serialization** for data serialization
- **kotlinx.coroutines** for concurrent scraping

For a project that involves both web scraping and LLM integration, Kotlin provides a good balance of performance, safety, and maintainability. The coroutines feature is particularly valuable for handling multiple news sources efficiently.

## Data Retrieval Methods

Different sources require different methods of data retrieval:

### API-Based Retrieval
1. **YouTube Data API**
   - Official API for accessing YouTube content
   - Requires API key from Google Cloud Console
   - Provides structured data including video metadata, comments, etc.
   - Rate limits apply (quota system)
   - Libraries: [YouTube Data API Client Library for Java](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/java)

2. **Reddit API**
   - Official Reddit API for accessing subreddit content
   - Requires OAuth authentication
   - Can retrieve posts, comments, and other content from specific subreddits
   - Rate limits apply
   - Libraries: [JRAW (Java Reddit API Wrapper)](https://github.com/mattbdean/JRAW)

### RSS/XML Feeds
- Many news sites and blogs provide RSS feeds
- Structured XML format that's easy to parse
- No authentication required for public feeds
- Limited to what the publisher includes in the feed
- Libraries: [Rome](https://github.com/rometools/rome) for Java/Kotlin

### Web Scraping
- Used when no API or RSS feed is available
- Extracts data directly from HTML
- More fragile (breaks when site layout changes)
- May require handling of JavaScript-rendered content
- Libraries: jsoup for HTML parsing

## Configuration Structure

A flexible configuration system will be implemented to support different retrieval methods:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "Example YouTube Channel",
      "type": "youtube",
      "channelId": "UC_x5XG1OV2P6uZZ5FSM9Ttw",
      "maxResults": 10
    },
    {
      "name": "Example Subreddit",
      "type": "reddit",
      "subreddit": "programming",
      "sortBy": "hot",
      "maxResults": 25,
      "useDirectApi": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Example News Site",
      "type": "rss",
      "url": "https://example.com/feed.xml"
    },
    {
      "name": "Example Blog",
      "type": "scrape",
      "url": "https://example.com/blog",
      "selectors": {
        "articles": ".article-container",
        "title": ".article-title",
        "content": ".article-content",
        "date": ".article-date"
      }
    }
  ],
  "global": {
    "cacheTimeMinutes": 60,
    "userAgent": "Newsgregator/1.0"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Set up a Kotlin project with Gradle
2. Add dependencies for:
   - HTTP client (ktor)
   - HTML parsing (jsoup)
   - JSON processing (kotlinx.serialization)
   - YouTube Data API client
   - Reddit API client (JRAW)
   - RSS parsing (Rome)
3. Create a modular architecture that allows for:
   - Adding new data sources easily with different retrieval methods
   - Processing and cleaning content from various sources
   - Interfacing with LLM APIs
4. Implement the configuration system
5. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for resilient data retrieval
