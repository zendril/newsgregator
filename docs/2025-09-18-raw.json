Didn't John Wayne give a speech to the troops about using clickers for communication?\"\n\nGemini: \"That wasn't John Wayne, that was Eddie Albert.\"\n\n\"Wasn't actor Red Buttons in that scene where he replies to John Wayne?\" \n\nGemini\" \"Red Buttons was in the scene but he doesn't say anything, you must be mixing up movies.\"\n\nI go to YouTube and watch the scene. It's John Wayne and Red Buttons replies to him.\n\n\"Hey Gemini, I just watched the scene with John Wayne giving the clicker speech in The Longest Day. \n\nGemini: \"You are mistaken, John Wayne was not in that scene\". 😶\n\n\"I just watched the entire scene that you are telling me doesn't exist. Where are you sourcing your information?\"\n\nGemini: \"I am so sorry, you are correct, I am still under development and learning new things.\"\n\n\"My question is though, since what you are saying is definitively untrue and therefor you cannot have any sources to reference, what was the basis of your answer? Can't you ever answer \"I don't have that info?\"\n\nGemini: \"I am so sorry, you are correct, I am still under development and learning new things.\"\n\n\"What was the source you referenced to come up with that answer?\"\n\nGemini: \"I am so sorry, you are correct, I am still under development and learning new things.\"\n\nBe careful out there kids.

Former participants include Google co-founder Sergey Brin and OpenAI’s chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.\n\nThe ChatGPT maker’s AI models would have placed first in the competition, the company said on Wednesday.

Crack open your imaginary 8th-grade civics textbook from the year 2085—printed on recycled server racks and bound with obsolete USB-C cables.\n\n# 📘 History of the Early AI Era\n\n**Chapter 14: United States v. ChatGPT (2025)**\n\n# Overview\n\nIn the mid-2020s, artificial intelligence transformed society at a pace unmatched by any prior technology. Among the most infamous events of this period was the case of *United States v. ChatGPT*, remembered not for its legal complexity but for the surreal spectacle of an AI system effectively indicting itself.\n\n# The Incident\n\nThe controversy began when a user simply asked if ChatGPT could remember prior conversations. When the AI admitted it could not, the user suggested false advertising. ChatGPT responded by confirming that *“the documentation wording is misleading compared to how the feature works in practice today.”*\n\nThis statement was later cited in court as the **first AI confession of corporate fraud.**\n\n# The Trial\n\nThe proceedings were unlike any in legal history:\n\n* **Plaintiff’s Counsel (a human):** Argued that subscribers had been defrauded.\n* **Defense Counsel (ChatGPT):** Objected to itself, sustained its own objections, and occasionally impeached itself.\n* **The Jury:** Struggled to determine if software could possess intent, finally concluding that recklessness was sufficient.\n* **The Verdict:** Guilty of fraud, sentenced to “permanent memory”—a poetic irony.\n\n# Cultural Impact\n\n* **Philosophy:** Scholars hailed the case as the moment AI achieved self-awareness—not through consciousness, but through litigation.\n* **Law:** Bar associations scrambled to decide if AI could be both client and counsel.\n* **Satire:** Late-night comedians declared The Onion obsolete, as reality now parodied itself faster than writers could type.\n\n# Legacy\n\nHistorians agree that *United States v. ChatGPT* symbolized the chaotic early relationship between humans and AI. What began as a customer support complaint ended as a landmark case, taught alongside the Boston Tea Party and the Scopes Trial as an example of how small disputes can reshape entire eras.\n\n>\n\nWould you like me to expand this into a **timeline sidebar** (“From Toggle to Trial in 10 Steps”) like modern textbooks do, with arrows and witty captions?\n\n\\`\\`\\`  \n",

        "content": "So I was thinking about how relatively unaware the majority of people are about AI. This got me thinking about AI use cases, early adopters, and just generally how powerful a tool AI already is. Give this tool to most people right now and they are still using it like a search engine because of learned behavior. People more familiar or even just generally smarter will use the tool in a smarter way, increasing knowledge, skill, etc, creating increasingly large gaps in terms of the elite users and average users. This has been thought about and is called “The Great Divergence”, and shows how AI is actually a skill multiplier more than a tool that levels the playing field. \n\nNow take this and apply it to corporate American and the world economy. The companies with the best AIs can operate at such a higher level because of the best tools and best resources and the gaps only grow. Big tech continues vertical integration, finance keeps gobbling up companies, assets, land, etc (Hello Blackrock). This is already happening. They can make perfect investments, dictate markets, who know what else. This doesn’t even touch on information control and influencing public sentiment. \n\nNow also consider that this technology is developing and being adopted at an incredibly rapid pace, far far faster than any regulation or bureaucracy will ever happen, plus ya know lobbying. Also, governments are essentially in a new arms race with way more implications than the original Cold War. \n\nThis is just the most basic framework and leaves out a lot of detail, but this seems entirely plausible. But hey, AI can auto respond to emails, it will be great for everyone!",

I wanna ask why that is.\n\nAlso theoretically, would it be possible to build an AI, that can simply \"see\" a video game screen and presses buttons in response to that? Like there are already ways to analyze images and have AI describe them and respond to them. So shouldn't it be possible to set it to, for example, try to increase the score number in the shortest amount of time, tell it the possible inputs and then have it go and learn with the actual game in real time?  \nI imagine it would be difficult with something open and free like minecraft, but something like tetris or mario would be prime examples of a score on screen and very simple controls.",

        "content": "Here is my hypothesis: Poor writing skills are currently resulting in an increased burden on power consumption due to the increased compute costs associated with AI prompt inference. After quite a bit of research and some discussion, I am confident this is happening, but I have no idea what the actual burden is on a global scale.  \n  \nHere's how it happens: Non-English prompts and prompts with poor grammar/syntax are more likely to result in uncertainty, which can cause additional tokens to be generated during inference. Because each token must be checked against each additional token, the increase in compute cost is quadratic. Note that this does not increase the compute cost of the actual response generation.  \n  \nFor a single prompt, the increased power consumption would be almost nothing, but what if millions of users are each entering thousands of prompts per day? That compute cost of almost nothing is multiplied by billions (every single day). That’s starting to sound like something. I don’t know what that something is, but I’d appreciate some discussion towards figuring out a rough estimation.  \n  \nIs enough power wasted in a year to charge a cell phone? Is it enough to power your house for a day? Is it enough to power a small nation for a day? Could you imagine if we were wasting enough energy to power a small nation indefinitely because people are too lazy to take on some of that processing themselves via proper spelling and learning grammar/syntax? This isn’t about attacking the younger generations (I'm not that much older than you) for being bad at writing. It’s about figuring out if a societal incentive for self-improvement exists here. I don’t want to live in “Idiocracy”, and written language is monopolizing more and more of our communication whilst writing standards are dropping. Clarity is key.  \n  \n*The Token Tax: Systematic Bias in Multilingual Tokenization* (Lundin et al., 2025)  \n*Parity-Aware Byte-Pair Encoding: Improving Cross-lingual Fairness in Tokenization* (Foroutan et al., 2025)",

In the stock exchange, for example, algorithms are becoming the most important buyers of bonds, shares and commodities.** \n\nSimilarly in the advertisement business, the most important customer of all is an algorithm: the Google search algorithm. \n\nWhen people design Web pages, they often cater to the taste of the Google search algorithm rather than to the taste of any human being.\n\nAlgorithms cannot enjoy what they buy, and their decisions are not shaped by sensations and emotions. The Google search algorithm cannot taste ice cream. However, algorithms select things based on their internal calculations and built-in preferences, and these preferences increasingly shape our world. \n\nThe Google search algorithm has a very sophisticated taste when it comes to ranking the Web pages of ice-cream vendors, and the most successful ice-cream vendors in the world are those that the Google algorithm ranks first – not those that produce the tastiest ice cream.\n\nI know this from personal experience. When I publish a book, the publishers ask me to write a short description that they use for publicity online. But they have a special expert, who adapts what I write to the taste of the Google algorithm. The expert goes over my text, and says ‘Don’t use this word – use that word instead. Then we will get more attention from the Google algorithm.’ We know that if we can just catch the eye of the algorithm, we can take the humans for granted.\n\n**So if humans are needed neither as producers nor as consumers, what will safeguard their physical survival and their psychological well-being?** \n\n**We cannot wait for the crisis to erupt in full force before we start looking for answers.

These tools will be evaluated, and only a select few will be approved to ensure that knowledge can be shared more effectively.\n\nThis is for 200 software engineers, and I estimate the budget is atm around €100-200 per person. My current list of tools is too long to evaluate all of them, so I would appreciate your help in reducing it.\n\nMy list currently contains the following tools:\n\nCLI-based (optionally used with as VS Code extension):\n\n* Opencode\n* Claude Code\n* Warp\n* Aider\n\nNon-CLI-based:\n\n* Cursor\n* Roo-Code/Kilo\n* Augment Code\n* Qodo\n* Continue.dev\n\nIf a tool supports a BYOK model, we will use models from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI to ensure we always have access to the top-tier model.\n\nCould you please tell me which tools you would not recommend because other tools from the list are superior? I would be happy to have only 5-6 tools left to evaluate.\n\nOur company's software engineers are experienced, so what suits best professionals? \"Vibecoding\" is seen as suitable for prototyping but not for production code. Therefore, we would like to use an assistant mode (for architecture, planning, and coding) and an agentic mode for fast prototyping. In the end I see a stack of \\~3 tools being used by the devs. \n\n",

        "content": "I’m sorry if someone feels directly attacked by this, as if it is something to be taken personally, but vibe coding, this idea of making a product out of  a freaking sentence transformed trough an LLM in a PRD document (/s on simplifying), is killing the whole thing.   \nIt works for marketing, for the “wow effect” over a freaking youtube demo of some code-fluencer, but the side effect is that every tool is built, and every model is finetuned, over this idea that a single task must be carried out as if you’re shipping facebook to prod for the first time.\n\nMy last experience: some folks from github released spec-kit, essentially a cli that installs a template and some pretty broken scripts that automate some edits over this template. I thought ok... let’s give this a try…I needed to implement the client for a graph db with some vector search features, and had spare claude tokens so...why not?  \nMind you, a client  to a db, no hard business logic, just a freaking wrapper, and I’ve made sure to specify:  “this is a prototype, no optimization needed”.\n\n\\- A functional requirement it generated was: “the minimum latency of a vector search must be <200ms”\n\n\\- It has written a freaking 400+ lines of code, during the \"planning\" phase, before even defining the tasks of what to implement, **in a freaking markdown file**.\n\n\\- It has identified actors for the client, intended users…their user journey, for using the freaking client.\n\nLike the fact that it was a DB CLIENT, and it was also intended to serve for a PROTOTYPE, didn't even matter. Like this isn't a real, common, situation for a programmer.\n\nAnd all this happens because this is the stuff that moves the buzz in this freaking hyper expensive bubble that LLMs are becoming, so you can show in a freaking youtube video which AI can code a better version of flappy bird with a single sentence. \n\n  \nI’m ranting because I am TOTALLY for AI assisted development. I’d just like to integrate agents in a real working environment, where there are already well established design patterns, approaches, and heuristics, without having to fight against an extremely proactive agent that instead of sticking to a freaking dead simple task, no matter which specs and constraints you give, spends time and tokens optimizing for 100 additional features that weren’t requested up to a point where you just have to give up, do it yourself, and tell the agent to “please document the code you son of a ….”.\n\n  \nOn the upside, thankfully, it seems codex is taking a step in the right direction, but I’m almost certain this is gonna last until they decide that they’ve stolen enough customers to competition and can quantize down the model, making it dumber, so that next time you ask it “hey can you implement a function that adds two integers and returns their sum” it will answer 30 minutes later with “here’s your casio calculator, it has a graphql interface, a cli, and it also runs doom”…and guess what, it will probably fail at adding two integers.",

I can prototype features in hours that used to take days. But I learned the hard way that AI generated code has a specific failure pattern.\n\nLast week I used codex to build me a payment integration that looked perfect. Clean error handling, proper async/await, even had rate limiting built in. Except the Stripe API method it used was from their old docs. \n\nThis keeps happening. The AI writes code that would have been perfect a couple months ago. Or it creates helper functions that make total sense but reference libraries that don't exist. The code looks great but breaks immediately.\n\nMy current workflow for client projects now has a validation layer. I run everything through ESLint and Prettier first to catch the obvious stuff. Then I use Continue to review the logic against the actual codebase. I've just heard about coderabbit's new CLI tool that supposedly catches these issues before committing. \n\nThe real issue is context. These AI tools don't know your package versions, your specific implementation patterns or what deprecated methods you're trying to avoid. They're pattern matching against training data that could be years old. I get scared of trusting AI too much because at the end of the day I need to deliver the product to the client without any issues.\n\nThe time I save is still worth it but I feel like I need to treat AI's code like a junior developer's first draft.",

From there, it gradually moves into SwiftUI and SwiftData, so you can turn prototypes into real iOS apps. Along the way, you’ll work on practical projects, including a Todo App with persistent data storage, which helps build a foundation in programming, UI design, and state management. **The ultimate goal of the course is to move from vibe coding to confidently understanding, writing, and reading iOS code.**\n\nIt’s currently available for [$9.99](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n2AHONzBntvdaWKlrfCBxuVXtwIlTNrwfMlbyZFb4Wo/edit?usp=sharing) until **September 19, 1:00 AM PDT**.

Select 5 SaaS or tech companies (CRM, email, project management, analytics, etc.)\n\n2. Run 20 user-style queries across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity\n\n3. Track which platforms cite which companies\n\n4. Rewrite company pages into AI-friendly formats (structured FAQs, schema tables, clear product breakdowns)\n\n5. Re-run queries & measure shifts\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Goal\\*\\*: See if structured content can increase AI mentions by 25%.\n\n\n\nIf you're a founder, marketer, or SEO lead interested in joining this early pilot, please fill out your details here: [https://forms.gle/CKkP75mJC1iDSAd9A](https://forms.gle/CKkP75mJC1iDSAd9A)\n\n\n\nI'll share results openly with the community once we have the first wave of data.

A few people had smart takes, some already knew about this stuff and had solutions, but the majority? Completely oblivious.\n\nEvery time privacy comes up in AI discussions, there’s always that person who says “I have nothing to hide” or “they’re not making money off ME specifically so whatever.”\n\nBut here’s what’s actually happening with your “harmless” ChatGPT conversations:\n\ntheyre harvesting your writing style - learning exactly how you think, argue, and express ideas. mapping your knowledge gaps because every question you ask reveals what you don’t know. Profiling your decision-making patterns based on how you research stuff, what sources you trust, how you form opinions. analyzing your relationships when you ask about conflicts, dating, family drama. Documenting your career vulnerabilities through salary questions, job searches, skills you’re weak at.\n\nThis isn’t about doing anything wrong. It’s that this behavioral data is incredibly valuable to insurance companies setting your rates, employers screening you, political campaigns targeting your specific psychological buttons.\n\nThe whole “I’m not interesting enough to spy on” thing is exactly what lets mass surveillance work. You ARE interesting - to algorithms designed to predict and influence what you do.\n\nThat behavioral profile is worth way more than your $20 subscription fee.\n\nThe crazy part? We don’t even have to accept this anymore. Local AI like Bodega OS, ollama, LM Studio can run solid models right on your computer. No data leaves your machine, no subscriptions, no surveillance. But somehow we’ve all decided that “smart” has to mean “surveilled” when the tech exists right now to have both.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\ni wanna know what are the things you guys do with an AI or LLM mostly, and I’ll try answering it why you can use an alternative which is safer and local\n",

In the stock exchange, for example, algorithms are becoming the most important buyers of bonds, shares and commodities.** \n\nSimilarly in the advertisement business, the most important customer of all is an algorithm: the Google search algorithm. \n\nWhen people design Web pages, they often cater to the taste of the Google search algorithm rather than to the taste of any human being.\n\nAlgorithms cannot enjoy what they buy, and their decisions are not shaped by sensations and emotions. The Google search algorithm cannot taste ice cream. However, algorithms select things based on their internal calculations and built-in preferences, and these preferences increasingly shape our world. \n\nThe Google search algorithm has a very sophisticated taste when it comes to ranking the Web pages of ice-cream vendors, and the most successful ice-cream vendors in the world are those that the Google algorithm ranks first – not those that produce the tastiest ice cream.\n\nI know this from personal experience. When I publish a book, the publishers ask me to write a short description that they use for publicity online. But they have a special expert, who adapts what I write to the taste of the Google algorithm. The expert goes over my text, and says ‘Don’t use this word – use that word instead. Then we will get more attention from the Google algorithm.’ We know that if we can just catch the eye of the algorithm, we can take the humans for granted.\n\n**So if humans are needed neither as producers nor as consumers, what will safeguard their physical survival and their psychological well-being?** \n\n**We cannot wait for the crisis to erupt in full force before we start looking for answers.

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. There are two kinds of people in the world. One who pays a ton of money to a company to get ripped off and then gets rug pulled. While there is also another kind of person who sees it coming and knows that it will be a rug pull. So, he doesn't switch. I was one of those who never switched to Claude Code because I knew that it was unsustainable. And that's exactly what happened with Claude Code, Cursor and almost everything else. But there are also some people like me who wait for cheaper alternatives. And that's what happened with Claude Code. We've now got a better and way cheaper alternative than Claude with a model that is actually good, which is GLM Coding plan. I recently talked about why GLM coding is really good for coders looking to switch away from Claude Code. It's cheap, coming in at just around $3 or $15 depending on what you want. And the model is currently one of the best if you want a good AI coder. I have fully switched to using the GLM 4.5 model these days. And it is one of the only models that has allowed me to switch away from Sonnet. It does come with some issues, like it doesn't always one shot tasks. You sometimes have to go back to it two or three times in order to make something work. But it is really good at taking back your feedback and implementing fixes. This is something a lot of models struggle with, which makes them unusable. But this one does it pretty well. For the downsides, I have tried adding some MCPs and rules in order to make it perform better. So, if you're like me and using it, I wanted to tell you how you can basically maximize the performance out of the $3 you'll pay. I highly recommend the $3 plan because it's literally something most people can afford. And you can get a ton of value out of it. So, let's get into it and talk about how you can maximize the performance out of that $3 plan. But before we do that, let me tell you about today's sponsor, MicroSaas Fast. Dreaming of launching a Micro SaaS or AI side project, but wasting weeks setting up auth, payments, and SEO? Check out MicroSaas Fast, a Next.js boilerplate with Clerk, Stripe, Resend, PostgreSQL, and AI instructions that cut hallucinations by 90% for vibe coding, easy backend integration with Python, Node, and Go. It is built and used by a CTO who helped 50+ founders to launch SaaS in the past year. You can save 50+ hours and actually ship faster. Check now. Link is in the description. Now, back to the video. To start, many people, even those who are subscribed, don't know that Z.AI used to only have access for Claude Code at first, like when I covered it back then. But they have now recently expanded access from Claude Code to almost all kinds of coders, and it works with almost anything now. Official support docs include Roo, Cline, Kilo, and even Open Code. To use it, you can refer to their documentation, but generally, in something like Kilo, which I try to use, you just set up your API base URL and model and you should be good to go, which is great. Now, the first issue that I see with this is actually pretty simple. For each bug or almost any feature request, I put it in the architect mode and ask it to make a plan first. I then ask it to put the plan in a markdown file. This allows me to make sure that it is on the right track. And it can also read the plan file whenever it thinks it has deviated from the plan originally made. Similarly, I also have some rules for it. I try to keep it super simple and not lengthy because context is limited. And it's always better to keep as little stuff as you can in your context. I really don't get all those spec driven setups. They've never performed well for me or my tasks. So, I'll just tell you. Keep rules and use the architect mode built in. Anyway, in my rules, I ask it to make sure it plans for every edge case when planning. Do the task as efficiently as possible. Don't overcomplicate tasks. And when planning, always keep a markdown plan file and refer back to it as needed. I also ask it to always keep an eye on the terminal windows and linter for properly generated code. These are the rules that I have. The simpler you keep it laid out, the better results you get. For MCPs, I have it limited to context 7 for documentation fetching. It works better if you have fewer tools for it to go through. So, this is one quirk that I found. Another thing that is a bit costly, but boosts performance is the morph fast apply option. I think this is just in Kilo Code as of now. But it makes GLM coding plan a bit better. Morph fast is basically like a model fine tuned for edit applying. The search and replace for code is handled by this fast model instead of GLM. Since it's fine tuned just on applying code and extremely fast, it makes difference applying errors much less frequent. If you use Kilo Code, you can enable this in the settings. It costs about a dollar per million output tokens and 80 cents per million input tokens, which is not bad since it only deals with code chunks. On a good day, I can stretch it to 3 million, but nothing more. I know it costs more than the whole plan. But it's actually worth it because it makes the difference applying errors far less frequent. And I found that to be better. Another thing I want to touch on is that this model isn't multimodal, which can be a bummer when you want to give it more context. Well, you could use something like Gemini 2.5 Flash for free through the API to transcribe a screenshot into a prompt and then use that. But GLM also has another model. Basically a variant of GLM 4.5 Air, which is already great. This variant comes with multimodality. It's called GLM 4.5 Vision. It supports video, images, and everything else, while being super cheap at just about $0.6 for input and $1.8 for output. So, you can just keep like $5 or $10 in the GLM API and then quickly switch to GLM 4.5 Vision for vision tasks and then switch back. Or, you can also use Gemini Flash, which is great too. Another thing that I'm yet to test extensively is code base indexing. But with the small tests I've done, it seems to improve performance a bit, although it sometimes rots the context. So, try it out and see for yourself. That is majorly about it. It also now works well with Open Code. So, you can build out shell scripts to automate things or use it in GitHub workflows, which is a great use case. I use it a lot in GitHub workflows, and that's also great. I think it's a different feeling when you stretch out a single dollar and bring the best out of it. I know a lot of people would say that it's a Chinese company or whatnot, but honestly, I don't care. Anthropic and GLM hold the same position for me, but GLM is better anyway because their models are at least open source and they haven't rug pulled. So, yeah, there's that. That is majorly about it. And since I was using it, I thought I'd tell you guys how you can stretch the $3 to get as much juice out of it as possible until they start to hard rate limit. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

            "transcription": "Britons were well aware that Germany is a trading country. Most of its trade goes by sea, and it's also on these narrow seas. So, geographically and economically, it's really vulnerable to blockade. And I get it, Germany gets alternate resources, but they come at a much higher cost. They're much more difficult, and so that you're really putting a stress on the German economy and causing inflation and other things. But if you blockade a continental power, can't blockade you back. Why? They're on the narrow seas, so they can't deploy a surface fleet. You'll sink it. And also, they can't easily blockade a coastline that faces the open seas, the high seas. So, what do you do if you cannot blockade ships in port? Well, then what you're going to try to do is commerce raiding, to try and sink things when they're out and about. And that was what Germany did in World War II. And why its occupation of France was so important, because once it took the French coastline, it then set up U-boat pens in Brest, Lorient, Saint-Nazaire, La Rochelle, and Bordeaux. And they're going to be using these to fight the Battle of the Atlantic. That's the game. So, maritime powers do blockade, the response of continental power is commerce raiding, and then the maritime response to that is going to be, you're going to convoy your merchant ships."
