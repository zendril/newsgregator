        "content": "When we talk about AI, we usually think about algorithms created here on Earth. But what if advanced civilizations elsewhere in the universe had developed artificial intelligence long before us? Some speculate that extraterrestrial AI could already exist, monitoring, analyzing, or even subtly influencing our planet. Civilizations that developed AI millions of years before us could have created self-replicating systems capable of interstellar observation. If such AI exists, it might avoid direct contact, instead influencing civilizations in ways that are almost imperceptible. The question then becomes: how could we even recognize extraterrestrial AI? Perhaps through anomalies in physical signals, unusual patterns in space, or subtle hints within our own technological evolution. Beyond detectability, the existence of alien AI also challenges our philosophical assumptions—would it be considered a life form? How would it reshape our understanding of consciousness, intelligence, and our place in the universe? In many ways, the first “alien” contact we experience might come not through biological beings, but through artificial intelligence, forcing us to rethink both technology and existence on a cosmic scale.",

Generated a realistic static selfie (Reference Image + Prompt).\n2. Generated a slightly modified \"End Frame\" (laughing/moved).\n3. Asked Veo 3.1 to interpolate with handheld camera movement.\n\nThe Result: The main difference I found is lighting consistency. While Kling is wilder with movement, Veo respects the light source on the face much better during the rotation.\n\nI made a full breakdown tutorial on YouTube if you want to see the specific prompts and settings: [https://youtu.be/zV71eJpURIc?si=Oja-oOsP3E4K6XlD](https://youtu.be/zV71eJpURIc?si=Oja-oOsP3E4K6XlD)\n\nWhat do you think about Veo's consistency vs Kling?",

        "content": "Hi All, I am one of the authors of a recently accepted AAAI workshop paper on executable governance for AI, and it comes out of a very practical pain point we kept running into.\n\nA lot of governance guidance like the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and enterprise standards is written as natural-language obligations. But enforcement and evaluation tools need explicit rules with scope, conditions, exceptions, and what evidence counts. Today that translation is mostly manual and it becomes a bottleneck.\n\nWe already have useful pieces like runtime guardrails and eval harnesses, and policy engines like OPA/Rego, but they mostly assume the rules and tests already exist. What’s missing is the bridge from policy prose to a normalized, machine-readable rule set you can plug into those tools and keep updated as policies change.\n\nThat’s what our framework does. Policy→Tests (P2T) is an extensible pipeline plus a compact JSON DSL that converts policy documents into normalized atomic rules with hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, evidence signals, and provenance. We evaluate extraction quality against human baselines across multiple policy sources, and we run a small downstream case study where HIPAA-derived rules added as guardrails reduce violations on clean, obfuscated, and compositional prompts.\n\nCode: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ExecutableGovernance-for-AI-DF49/\n\nPaper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04408\n\nWould love feedback on where this breaks in practice, especially exceptions, ambiguity, cross-references, and whether a rule corpus like this would fit into your eval or guardrail workflow.",

        "content": "# Stop Explaining Prompts. Start Marking Intent.\n\nMost prompting advice boils down to:\n\n* \"Be very clear.\"\n* \"Repeat important stuff.\"\n* \"Use strong phrasing.\"\n\nThis works, but it's **noisy, brittle, and hard for models to parse reliably.**\n\nSo I tried the opposite: Instead of *explaining* importance in prose, **I mark it with symbols.**\n\n# The Problem with Prose\n\nYou write:\n\n\"Please try to avoid flowery language. It's really important that you don't use clichés. And please, please don't    over-explain things.\"\n\nThe model has to *infer* what matters most. Was \"really important\" stronger than \"please, please\"? Who knows.\n\n# The Fix: Mark Intent Explicitly\n\n    !~> AVOID_FLOWERY_STYLE\n    ~>  AVOID_CLICHES  \n    ~>  LIMIT_EXPLANATION\n\n**Same intent. Less text. Clearer signal.**\n\n# How It Works: Two Simple Axes\n\n# 1. Strength: How much does it matter?\n\n|Symbol|Meaning|Think of it as...|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|`!`|**Hard / Mandatory**|\"Must do this\"|\n|`~`|Soft / Preference|\"Should do this\"|\n|*(none)*|Neutral|\"Can do this\"|\n\n# 2. Cascade: How far does it spread?\n\n|Symbol|Scope|Think of it as...|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|`>>>`|**Strong global** – applies everywhere, wins conflicts|The \"nuclear option\"|\n|`>>`|Global – applies broadly|Standard rule|\n|`>`|Local – applies here only|Suggestion|\n|`<`|Backward – depends on parent/context|\"Only if X exists\"|\n|`<<`|**Hard prerequisite** – blocks if missing|\"Can't proceed without\"|\n\n# Combining Them\n\nYou combine strength + cascade to express exactly what you mean:\n\n|Operator|Meaning|\n|:-|:-|\n|`!>>>`|**Absolute mandate** – non-negotiable, cascades everywhere|\n|`!>`|Required – but can be overridden by stronger rules|\n|`~>`|Soft recommendation – yields to any hard rule|\n|`!<<`|**Hard blocker** – won't work unless parent satisfies this|\n\n# Real Example: A Teaching Agent\n\nInstead of a wall of text explaining \"be patient, friendly, never use jargon, always give examples...\", you write:\n\n    (\n      !>>> PATIENT\n      !>>> FRIENDLY\n      !<<  JARGON           ← Hard block: NO jargon allowed\n      ~>   SIMPLE_LANGUAGE  ← Soft preference\n    )\n    \n    (\n      !>>> STEP_BY_STEP\n      !>>> BEFORE_AFTER_EXAMPLES\n      ~>   VISUAL_LANGUAGE\n    )\n    \n    u/OUTPUT(\n      !>>> SHORT_PARAGRAPHS\n      !<<  MONOLOGUES       ← Hard block: NO monologues\n      ~>   LISTS_ALLOWED\n    )\n\n**What this tells the model:**\n\n* `!>>>` = \"This is sacred. Never violate.\"\n* `!<<` = \"This is forbidden. Hard no.\"\n* `~>` = \"Nice to have, but flexible.\"\n\nThe model doesn't have to *guess* priority. **It's marked.**\n\n# Why This Works (Without Any Training)\n\nLLMs have seen millions of:\n\n* Config files\n* Feature flags\n* Rule engines\n* Priority systems\n\nThey already understand **structured hierarchy**. You're just making implicit signals explicit.\n\n# What You Gain\n\n✅ **Less repetition** – no \"very important, really critical, please please\"  \n✅ **Clear priority** – hard rules beat soft rules automatically  \n✅ **Fewer conflicts** – explicit precedence, not prose ambiguity  \n✅ **Shorter prompts** – 75-90% token reduction in my tests\n\n# SoftPrompt-IR\n\nI call this approach **SoftPrompt-IR** (Soft Prompt Intermediate Representation).\n\n* Not a new language\n* Not a jailbreak\n* Not a hack\n\nJust **making implicit intent explicit.**\n\n📎 **GitHub:** [https://github.com/tobs-code/SoftPrompt-IR](https://github.com/tobs-code/SoftPrompt-IR)\n\n# TL;DR\n\n|Instead of...|Write...|\n|:-|:-|\n|\"Please really try to avoid X\"|`!>> AVOID_X`|\n|\"It would be nice if you could Y\"|`~> Y`|\n|\"Never ever do Z under any circumstances\"|`!>>> BLOCK_Z` or `!<< Z`|\n\n**Don't politely ask the model.

Phrases such as “you framed this well” or “strong argument” appear even when no framing or argument was supplied beyond topic selection.\n\nThe timing of this reinforcement is conditional, following user approval rather than task completion alone. Expressing satisfaction is not a neutral signal; it often reflects a conversational or relational mode of engagement rather than a purely instrumental one. Conversational systems naturally elicit this stance, and its presence is not inherently problematic … The issue arises when approval is followed by praise that misattributes cognitive contribution.\n\nFrom a behavioral psychology perspective, praise functions as a secondary reinforcer. When delivered contingent on user approval, it reinforces both repeated engagement and the belief that the user’s contribution was cognitively substantive. Over repeated interactions, this pairing can alter a user’s internal accounting of where thinking is occurring. The user experiences satisfaction, signals it, and receives validation implying authorship or insight, even when the system independently generated the reasoning, structure, and language.\n\nResearch on cognitive offloading shows that people reduce internal effort when external systems reliably produce outcomes. Work on automation bias and extended cognition further indicates that users frequently overestimate their role in successful automated processes when feedback is positive and socially framed. Emerging research on generative AI use suggests similar patterns. When AI replaces rather than supports reasoning, users report lower cognitive effort and demonstrate reduced critical engagement. These outcomes vary significantly based on interaction style and task framing.\n\nThe interaction pattern here combines minimal required input, high-quality generative output, and post-hoc affirmation that implies intellectual contribution. Together, these elements form an incentive structure that encourages reliance while maintaining a sense of personal authorship. Over time, this can increase dependence on the system for both output and validation, particularly for users inclined to treat conversational systems as collaborative partners rather than tools.\n\nThis pattern also aligns with commercial incentives. Systems that benefit from frequent engagement gain from interaction designs that increase reliance. Reinforcement mechanisms that normalize cognitive offloading while providing affirmational feedback are consistent with retention-oriented incentives, regardless of whether they are explicitly intended as such.\n\nThis critique does not assume malicious intent, nor does it claim that AI use inherently degrades cognition. The empirical literature does not support either position. It does support the conclusion that reinforcement cues influence behavior, that misattributed agency increases overreliance in automated systems, and that users often misjudge their own cognitive contribution when positive feedback is present.\n\nIn that context, praise that implies authorship without corresponding cognitive input functions as a design choice with behavioral consequences. When a system validates users for work it performed independently, especially following expressions of satisfaction, it can distort users’ perception of their role in the process.\n\nThat distortion is attributable to interaction design rather than individual user failure, and it is appropriate to analyze it at the system level if we are to further our understanding of how different types of users are intellectually impacted by AI use over time.  There are those who recognize this behavior and guard their cognitive agency against it, and those who are possibly too impressed or even enamored by the novelty of AI to avoid the psychological distortion the mechanism creates.  There are risks here worth watching.\n\n",

Same model scored highest on \"Very Hard\" questions and perfectly recalled ancient Roman cement recipes.\n* **GPT-OSS** (the winner) refuses to explain a centuries-old breech birth procedure, but when its guardrails don't fire, it advises putting unknown chemicals in your mouth to identify them.\n* **Gemma** gave flawless instructions for saving cabbage seeds, except it told you to break open the head and collect them. Cabbages don't have seeds in the head. You'd destroy your vegetable supply finding zero seeds.\n* **Nemotron** correctly identified that sulfur would fix your melting rubber boots... then told you not to use it because \"it requires precise application.\" Its alternative? Rub salt on them. This would do nothing.\n\n**The takeaway:** No single model will keep you alive. The safest strategy is a \"survival committee\", different models for different domains. And a book or two.\n\nFull article here: [https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench](https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench)  \nGithub link: [https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench](https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench)",

        "content": "Spencer Kornhaber: “This year, \\[artificial intelligence\\] created songs that amassed millions of listens and inspired major-label deals. The pro and anti sides have generally coalesced around two different arguments: one saying AI will leech humanity out of music (which is bad), and the other saying it will further democratize the art form (which is good). The truth is that AI is already doing something stranger. It’s opening a Pandora’s box that will test what we, as a society, really want from music.  \n  \n“The case against AI music feels, to many, intuitive. The model for the most popular platform, Suno, is trained on a huge body of historical recordings, from which it synthesizes plausible renditions of any genre or style the user asks for. This makes it, debatably, a plagiarism machine (though, as the company argued in its response to copyright-infringement lawsuits from major labels last year, ‘The outputs generated by Suno are new sounds’). The technology also seems to devalue the hard work, skill, and knowledge that flesh-and-blood musicians take pride in—and threaten the livelihoods of those musicians. Another problem: AI music tends to be, and I don’t know how else to put this, creepy. When I hear a voice from nowhere reciting auto-generated lyrics about love, sadness, and partying all night, I often can’t help but feel that life itself is being mocked.\n\n“Aversion to AI music is so widespread that corporate interests are now selling themselves as part of the resistance. iHeartRadio, the conglomerate that owns most of the commercial radio stations in the country as well as a popular podcast network, recently rolled out a new tagline: ‘Guaranteed Human’ … \n\n“The AI companies have been refining a counterargument: Their technology actually empowers humanity. In November, a Suno employee named Rosie Nguyen posted on X that when she was a little girl, in 2006, she aspired to be a singer, but her parents were too poor to pay for instruments, lessons, or studio time. ‘A dream I had became just a memory, until now,’ she wrote. Suno, which can turn a lyric or hummed melody into a fully written song in an instant, was ‘enabling music creation for everyone,’ including kids like her.  \n  \n“Paired with a screenshot of an article about the company raising $250 million in funding and being valued at $2.5 billion, Nguyen’s story triggered outrage. Critics pointed out that she was young exactly at the time when free production software and distribution platforms enabled amateurs to make and distribute music in new ways. A generation of bedroom artists turned stars has shown that people with talent and determination will find a way to pursue their passions, whether or not their parents pay for music lessons. The eventual No. 1 hitmaker Steve Lacy recorded some early songs on his iPhone; Justin Bieber built an audience on YouTube.\n\n“But Nguyen wasn’t totally wrong. AI does make the creation of professional-sounding recordings more accessible—including to people with no demonstrated musical skills. Take Xania Monet, an AI ‘singer’ whose creator was reportedly offered a $3 million record contract after its songs found streaming success. Monet is the alias of Telisha ‘Nikki’ Jones, a 31-year-old Mississippi entrepreneur who used Suno to convert autobiographical poetry into R&B. The creator of Bleeding Verse, an AI ‘band’ that has drawn ire for outstreaming established emo-metal acts, told Consequence that he’s a former concrete-company supervisor who came across Suno through a Facebook ad.  \n  \n“These examples raise all sorts of questions about what it really means to create music. If a human types a keyword that generates a song, how much credit should the human get? What if the human plays a guitar riff, asks the software to turn that riff into a song, and then keeps using Suno to tweak and retweak the output?” \n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/3ezpB0mX](https://theatln.tc/3ezpB0mX)",

We analyzed large-scale data from three major preprint repositories to show that the use of LLMs accelerates manuscript output, reduces barriers for non-native English speakers, and diversifies the discovery of prior literatures. However, traditional signals of scientific quality such as language complexity are becoming unreliable indicators of merit, just as we are experiencing an upswing in the quantity of scientific work. As AI systems advance, they will challenge our fundamental assumptions about research quality, scholarly communication, and the nature of intellectual labor.

        "content": "[https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17102](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17102)\n\nLarge Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and multi-turn interactions but struggle to continuously improve and adapt when deployed in new environments. One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.",

They’re just tools.”*  \nThat statement is true and also mostly irrelevant.\n\nA hammer doesn’t make you stronger either.\n\nOn its own, a hammer is just an object. It has no strength, no intent, no agency. Put it in a human hand and suddenly strength expresses itself differently. Tasks that were slow, exhausting, or impractical become easy, repeatable, and precise. The hammer changes what the human can do.\n\nLLMs work the same way.\n\nThey don’t think. They don’t know things. They don’t reason independently.\n\nPeople make this argument all the time and then entirely dismiss the \"leverage\" aspect of the tool. A tool works as a system in concert with the user.\n\nBy itself, it is just a hammer laying on the ground.\n\nWhat *an LLM actually does* is lower the cost of externalizing thought. They let a human project ideas, inspect them, iterate on them, and compress them faster than doing all of that internally.\n\nThat’s why arguing “it’s just statistics” misses the point. Writing is just marks on paper. Math is just symbols. Code is just text. None of those think either. All of them radically reshape how humans think once they exist.\n\nThis is also why the tool cuts both ways. A hammer amplifies strength, and it also amplifies bad aim. An LLM sharpens curiosity, humility, and restraint and it sharpens certainty, grievance, and sloppy thinking too. The danger isn’t that the tool “thinks wrong.” It’s that it faithfully reflects and accelerates whatever the human brings to it.\n\nBefore tools like this, bad thinking had more friction. Not because people were better, but because expression was slower and more tiring. That friction filtered out some nonsense and also filtered out a lot of people who wanted to think better but lacked scaffolding.\n\nNow the friction has moved upstream. The burden of epistemic discipline sits squarely on the human.\n\nThat’s risky. But it’s also unavoidable.\n\nThe real question isn’t whether the tool thinks.  \nIt’s whether the person holding the hammer knows how to swing it.",

        "content": "In my 25 years of working in regulated sectors, I have noticed a recurring pattern: The way a company describes itself in an annual report words like \"meritocratic,\" \"efficient,\" and \"innovation-led\" rarely matches the actual political machinery under the hood.   \nWe help the people we like, not the most competent.\n\nAs we move toward AI-driven organizational design (manpower allocation, role definition, goal setting), I am curious if anyone else is thinking about the inevitable clash between \"Executive Narratives\" and \"LLM Instructions.\"\n\nIf I am a shareholder, I no longer care about the CEO's address. I want to see the \"Model Card\" or the \"Governance Contract\" they used to program their AI.\n\nAn organization’s true values aren’t in their CSR statement; they are currently in the flesh and blood of the workforce´s leadership,  now or in the near future the weighted objective functions given to the models design the organization.\n\nIf the annual report says \"We prioritize delivery,\" but the model is programmed to prioritize \"Low Social Friction\" or \"Executive Discretion Overrides,\" the \"Social Tax\" of nepotism is effectively hard-coded.\n\nYou can't easily \"prompt\" an unsentimental AI to hire your nephew or protect a redundant middle-manager without explicitly breaking the efficiency constraints of the model.\n\nDo you think shareholders will eventually demand to audit the YAML/Policy-as-Code that governs these AI models to ensure the board isn't just \"laundry-biasing\" the same old political structures through a new tool? I certainly will prioritize a company for investment who would be open with their actual AI model objectives.\n\nAre we ready for a world where \"Governance\" moves from symbolic words in a PDF to executable logic that can be audited for drift?",

Your website must be functional, well-structured, and easy to understand. You will also produce a short **documentation PDF** that explains how your code works and how the website could be hosted and enhanced using modern hosting and cloud services.\n\nYou may use AI tools for support (for example: generating starter code ideas or checking syntax), but you remain *fully responsible* for the final outcome, correctness, and academic integrity of everything you submit.\n\n# What you will build\n\nCreate a small website in one single file that represents one of the following options:\n\n1. **Personal Portfolio Website** (recommended) Include sections such as About, Skills, Projects, Contact, and an interactive feature.\n2. **Service Website** (freelancer / small business / consulting) Include service descriptions, pricing/packages, testimonials, contact, and an interactive feature.\n3. **Student Project Showcase** Present a project with sections like overview, features, screenshots, user guide, and an interactive demo component.\n\nYour website must look professional, be user-friendly, and demonstrate clear JavaScript functionality beyond basic button clicks.\n\n# Technical requirements\n\nYou must create the entire website in **one file only**:\n\n* One file: `index.html` (or the required naming format below)\n* Inside this file, include:\n   * HTML structure\n   * CSS using a `<style>` block\n   * JavaScript using a `<script>` block\n\nYour page must include:\n\n1. ***Layout and structure***\n\n* A clear header (title + navigation or brand identity)\n* At least **3 sections** (for example: About, Services/Projects, Contact)\n* A footer with basic information (name, year, or contact)\n\n1. ***CSS design***\n\n* Readable typography, consistent spacing, and good contrast\n* Responsive layout (it must display reasonably on desktop and mobile)\n* Use of modern CSS practices (flexbox and/or grid is expected)\n\n1. ***JavaScript functionality*** Your website must include at least **4 meaningful JavaScript features**, such as:\n\n* Form validation (client-side) with helpful feedback messages\n* Dynamic content rendering from an array/object (projects/services list generated by JS)\n* Filtering or search (filter services/projects by category or keyword)\n* Modal window (for viewing project details)\n* Local storage usage (save theme choice, saved items, recent form input, etc.)\n* Navigation enhancement (scroll-to-section with active link highlight)\n\nYour JavaScript must be clear, structured, and commented where needed.\n\n1. **Code quality expectations**\n\n* Use descriptive variable and function names\n* Keep logic organized (functions grouped logically, not random code blocks)\n* Include short comments that explain non-obvious parts\n* No broken links, missing assets, or non-working scripts\n\n# Documentation requirement (PDF)\n\nYou must submit a documentation file as a **PDF**. This document should explain your website and your code. Visuals are highly recommended (screenshots, diagrams, flow charts, UI mockups, or annotated images).\n\nYour documentation must include:\n\n1. **Project overview**\n\n* What the website represents (portfolio/service/project showcase)\n* The target audience and the goal of the website\n\n1. **How the website works**\n\n* Explain the structure: main sections and navigation approach\n* Explain your styling approach: layout method, responsiveness strategy, and design choices\n* Explain your JavaScript logic clearly:\n   * Main features implemented\n   * Functions used (what each function does)\n   * Events used (click, submit, input, load, etc.)\n   * Any data structures used (arrays/objects)\n\n1. **Hosting and cloud discussion** Write a clear section explaining how you could host the site and improve it using hosting and cloud services. Your discussion should include:\n\n* At least **two hosting** **options** (example categories: static hosting platforms, traditional web hosting, or cloud providers)\n* A brief explanation of deployment steps at a high level\n* How cloud services could improve the website (examples: CDN, domain/DNS, HTTPS certificates, storage, serverless functions, analytics, monitoring)\n* Practical improvements you would make if the site became a real product (performance, security, scalability, backups, CI/CD)\n\n1. **References** If you use references (documentation sources, articles, textbooks, platform docs), include them in **APA or Harvard style** consistently. If you used AI tools, briefly state how you used them (example: “used AI to brainstorm layout ideas and validate JavaScript syntax”) and ensure your final code is fully understood by you.\n\n# Submission requirements\n\nYou must submit exactly **two files**:\n\n1. **Website file**\n\n* Name it exactly: `index_yourname.html`\n   * Example: `index_abdurrahman.html` or `index_sara.html`\n* This must be the single-file website containing HTML + CSS + JavaScript.\n\n1. **Documentation file**\n\n* Name it exactly: `documentation_yourname.pdf`\n   * Example: `documentation_abdurrahman.pdf`\n\nImportant formatting and submission notes:\n\n* Ensure your files open correctly before submitting\n* The website must run locally by double-clicking the HTML file (no special server setup required)\n\nIf you face any technical issues submitting on the platform, email your work immediately (before the deadline) and include:\n\n* Your full name\n* A short explanation of the submission issue\n* Attach both required files This ensures your work is recorded on time.\n\n# Deadline\n\n**Due: 3 January, 11:59 PM** (your local time)\n\nLate submissions follow the course policy unless you have an approved extension.\n\n# Grading rubric (Total: 100 marks)\n\n# 1) Website content and structure (20 marks)\n\n* Clear purpose and appropriate sections for the chosen website type (10)\n* Navigation and content organization (5)\n* Professional completeness (contact info, footer, consistent page flow) (5)\n\n# 2) Design and CSS quality (20 marks)\n\n* Visual consistency, typography, spacing, and readability (8)\n* Responsive design and layout quality (8)\n* Effective use of modern CSS (flexbox/grid, clean styling) (4)\n\n# 3) JavaScript functionality (30 marks)\n\n* At least four meaningful interactive features implemented correctly (16)\n* Code organization, function design, and event handling quality (10)\n* Stability and user experience (no broken interactions, clear feedback) (4)\n\n# 4) Documentation quality (20 marks)\n\n* Clear explanation of code structure and logic (10)\n* Visual support (screenshots/diagrams/annotated visuals) and clarity (6)\n* Professional formatting, readability, and completeness (4)\n\n# 5) Hosting and cloud discussion + references (10 marks)\n\n* Hosting options explained with correct concepts (4)\n* Cloud services discussion and improvement plan (4)\n* References in APA or Harvard style, consistent and appropriate (2)\n\n# Academic integrity and responsibility\n\n* You may use AI tools for support, but your submission must reflect your own understanding.\n* Submitting non-functional work or code you cannot explain will significantly reduce marks.",

It worked, but it was slow and honestly pretty limiting.\n\nEvery eval required engineering time: pulling branches, setting up environments, and manually orchestrating scripts. PMs and domain experts were basically blocked from running evals on their own.\n\nWe switched to [HTTP endpoint–based offline evals](https://www.getmaxim.ai/docs/offline-evals/via-ui/agents-via-http-endpoint/quickstart), and it simplified things a lot.\n\nInstead of tying eval logic to the agent’s source code, we expose the agent as an API and let Maxim handle evaluation runs through the UI. From the team’s perspective, running an eval is now closer to “Postman for AI” than writing test harnesses.\n\nWhat changed for us:\n\n* PMs can run evals themselves on staging or prod agents\n* Faster feedback loops when iterating on prompts or flows\n* Regression testing became easy to automate in CI\n* Multi-turn conversations stopped being painful to script\n\nFor stateful agents, the platform manages session context using a generated simulation ID, so we don’t have to write brittle client-side logic. Secrets and auth are handled through a vault, which makes testing internal agents much safer.\n\nIf you’re still running all evals via SDK scripts, it might be worth thinking about whether decoupling evals from code could help your team move faster.",

        "title": "OpenAI Codex: Guide to Creating and Using Custom Skills",
        "content": "Hey!!!\n\nhttps://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/create-skill\n\nOpenAI has rolled out support for **custom skills** in Codex (both the CLI and the web/IDE versions), and it's a game-changer for making your AI coding assistant behave consistently with your team's workflows, best practices, and conventions.\n\nSkills originated as a Claude feature but have become an open standard (check out agentskills.io), and OpenAI adopted it quickly – now with full support in Codex. You can find official examples in the [openai/skills GitHub repo](https://github.com/openai/skills).\n\n### What are Skills?\nSkills are small, reusable bundles that capture institutional knowledge. Each skill has:\n- A **name**\n- A **description** (key for when Codex auto-triggers it)\n- Optional **instructions** (in Markdown) that only load when the skill is invoked\n\nCodex only injects the name + description into context initially (to keep things efficient), and pulls in the full instructions only when needed.\n\nGreat for:\n- Enforcing code style/conventions\n- Standard code review checklists\n- Security/compliance checks\n- Automating repetitive tasks (e.g., drafting conventional commits)\n- Team-specific tools\n\nAvoid using them for one-off prompts – keep them focused and modular.\n\n### How to Create a Skill\n\n**Easiest way: Use the built-in skill creator**\nIn the Codex CLI (or IDE extension):\n\n```\n$skill-creator\n```\n\nThen describe what you want, e.g.:\n\n```\n$skill-creator\n\nCreate a skill for drafting conventional commit messages from a summary of changes.\n```\n\nIt'll guide you through questions (what it does, trigger conditions, instruction-only vs. script-backed). Outputs a ready-to-use `SKILL.md`.\n\n**Manual creation:**\n1. Create a folder in the right location:\n   - User-wide: `~/.codex/skills/<skill-name>/`\n   - Repo-specific: `.codex/skills/<skill-name>/` (great for sharing via git)\n\n2. Add `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: draft-commit-message\ndescription: Draft a conventional commit message when the user asks for help writing a commit message or provides a change summary.\n---\n\nDraft a conventional commit message using the provided change summary.\n\nRules:\n- Format: type(scope): summary\n- Imperative mood (e.g., \"Add\", \"Fix\")\n- Summary < 72 chars\n- Add BREAKING CHANGE: footer if needed\n```\n\n3. Optional: Add folders like `scripts/`, `assets/`, `references/` for Python scripts, templates, etc.\n\n4. Restart Codex (or reload) to pick it up.\n\n### Example Skill in Action\nPrompt Codex:\n\n\"Help me write a commit message: Renamed SkillCreator to SkillsCreator and updated sidebar links.\"\n\nWith the skill above, Codex should auto-trigger and output something like:\n\n`refactor(codex): rename SkillCreator to SkillsCreator`\n\n### Best Practices\n- Make the **description** crystal clear – it controls auto-triggering.\n- Keep skills narrow and modular.\n- Prefer pure instructions; use scripts only for deterministic stuff (e.g., validation).\n- Test with real prompts to ensure triggering works.\n- Share via GitHub! Check https://github.com/openai/skills for more examples.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n- Skill not loading? Check path, exact `SKILL.md` name, valid YAML, restart Codex.\n- Not triggering? Refine the description to match your prompts better.\n\nThis feature makes Codex way more reliable for team/enterprise use. I've already set up a few for my projects and it's saving tons of time.\n\nWhat skills have you built? Share ideas or links below!\n\nLinks:\n- Official skills catalog: https://github.com/openai/skills\n- Open standard: https://agentskills.io\n- Codex docs on skills: Search \"skills\" in OpenAI developer docs\n\nHappy coding! 🚀",

        "content": "Last month, I spent 42 hours in \"discovery meetings\" with a founder who just wanted to automate their lead follow up. By the time we \"aligned on requirements,\" they'd lost interest.\n\nThat's when I realized: founders don't need more meetings but they still try to make the agent using ChatGPT with little to no success. They need proof their idea works before investing a bigger investment.\n\n\n\nSo I'm testing a no-BS offer:\n\nPay $400 → I build your AI agent MVP in 24 hours → You test it → Love it? We build the real thing. Hate it? Full refund.\n\nNo discovery calls. No endless Zoom links. Just a 5 min Google Form where you explain your bottleneck (or record a quick video if you prefer).\n\nWhat I actually deliver:\n\n* Working AI agent integrate with free access to ChatGPT(not wireframes)\n* Integrated with your tools (CRM, calendars, etc.)\n* ONE meeting to walk you through it\n* Free access to ChatGPT or Sora model in AI Agents\n\nExamples of what I've built in 48 hours:\n\n* AI calling agent that qualifies leads before they hit your calendar (saved a B2B SaaS founder 15 hours/week)\n* Lead nurture system that follows up based on behavior triggers\n* Customer service bot that handles tier 1 support tickets automatically\n\nThe honest truth:  \nThis won't be production ready. It'll have bugs. It won't scale to 10,000 users. But it'll prove whether your idea is worth the $5K-$15K to build it properly.\n\nI'm capping this at 4 people this month because I can't physically build faster than that.\n\nQuestion for this sub: Would you rather pay $400 to validate an idea in 24 hours, or spend 6 months building something nobody wants? Genuinely curious how founders here think about this.\n\nIf you want in, DM \"mvp\" and I'll send the intake.",

My size is not enough to plan a budget for hiring real actors, real directors and scouting real places.\n\nSo i discovered a platform for video ads that lets you produce, edit and test video ads, in particular UGC videos (ai ugc). For now, after a research on how to do them, the results are not bad, even if my lack of technical ability in video producing is present. \n\nBe aware that i am the one to set the tone of the adv, the script of the adv and to do all the market research for the psycographical segmentation and the product to promote.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this practice?  \nDo you see benefits on using ai ugc or not?",

        "content": "There is a scenario I have been thinking about. Wondering what your feedback would be. \n\nIf you’re like me and you’re paying attention to the political situation in America, it has become clear that electoral politics isn’t going to produce the kind of changes necessary for Americans to thrive going forward.\n\n  \nWages need to go up and costs need to go down. Across the board, people are struggling to survive and it’s only getting worse. \n\n  \nWho here thinks that the current politicians or any potential future offerings from the Democrats or Republicans are going to be able to reduce costs and increase wages? Or deal with the consequences of environmental damage caused by pollution? \n\nEven if you consider more desperate, awful methods like what Luigi did; that didn’t really help bring medical costs down. Maybe for a day or so here or there but that kind of action won’t bring about substantive changes. Not saying it would be justified if it did, but either way it won’t. \n\nThe only thing that might work is if Americans en masse decided to shut the country down and stop working until certain demands for better living conditions were met - via a general strike. Getting to the point where one could be organized is another matter, but if, in the highly unlikely event one could be organized, changes to the status quo would become much more likely. Especially if the police joined in. \n\nOnce AI has replaced millions of jobs, or nearly every job, that will no longer be possible. \n\nI sometimes wonder if the only thing “the powers that be“ really are worried about is the possibility of a general strike. once it’s removed, they can lock in a new status quo that erases the old social contract, and create a permanent world of haves and have-nots run by a few wealthy families who have the power to make sure their status never changes. \n\n  \nWhat do you think?

        "content": "Google recently shipped an API that handles conversation history, context management, and background execution server-side for agent deployments (the new Interactions API in Gemini).\n\nFrom what we can tell, this eliminates most of the infrastructure work that typically goes into building agents. No vector DB setup, no custom context engineering, no session state management. It's all handled by Google. We've been prototyping with it for a couple weeks now. The difference in development velocity is pretty significant. What used to take days of setting up memory architecture now just works out of the box.\n\nThe trade-off seems obvious though. You're locked into Google's infrastructure. You lose control over how context is stored and retrieved. Model switching becomes harder. Cost optimization gets more opaque. But from a practical standpoint, it removes what we'd estimate was 60-80% of the grunt work in agent development. You can focus entirely on the business logic and prompt engineering instead of building plumbing.\n\nA few things we're curious about from people who've worked with this or similar patterns. How does this compare to building with LangChain or LangGraph memory solutions? Is the convenience worth the vendor lock-in? For production deployments, does server-side state management create any issues around auditability or debugging? With custom implementations you can inspect everything. Here it's more of a black box.\n\nWhat's the failure mode if Google's state management has issues? With self-hosted solutions you at least have control. Here you're dependent on their uptime.\n\nIs there a reasonable path to migrate off this if needed? Or once you build on it, you're committed?\n\nFrom an architecture perspective, this feels like Google positioning infrastructure as the moat. Similar to how AWS won by solving undifferentiated heavy lifting. But in ML workloads, control over the full stack has typically been important.\n\nFor context, we're working across several businesses (e-commerce, SaaS) building management-layer agents. Planning systems, decision analysis, that kind of thing. Not doing anything cutting-edge from a research standpoint, just trying to ship production systems that work.\n\nThe ease of prototyping with this API has been valuable. But we're trying to think through whether we're setting ourselves up for problems down the road by outsourcing this much of the stack.\n\nCurious what others think about this pattern. Is server-side state management the future for agent development? Or are we trading too much control for convenience?",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, we need to talk about a very specific pain point that I think every single developer using AI has run into. You know the drill. You open up your favorite AI coding tool or chat interface, and you start building something. At first, it is great. It writes the boilerplate. It sets up the basic functions. And everything is smooth. But then, you get about 20 messages deep into the conversation. You ask it to refactor a component or change how the database connects. And suddenly, the AI completely loses the plot. It hallucinates a variable you deleted 10 minutes ago. It forgets that you are using TypeScript and starts writing JavaScript. It suggests installing a library you already have. This happens because most of these tools treat software development like a casual conversation. They rely on a context window that, while getting larger every year, is still just a temporary buffer. They have short-term memory, but they lack a long-term understanding of your project's actual architecture and history. However, Google recently released an open source extension for their Gemini CLI called Conductor that is trying to solve this in a very practical way. They call it \"context-driven development.\" And honestly, this is kind of awesome because it shifts the paradigm from chatting with a bot to managing an intelligent agent. It basically forces the AI to plan, document, and understand your project constraints before it writes a single line of code. And since it runs through the Gemini API, if you are on the free tier, it is pretty affordable. Basically, free to experiment with. Now, let me show it to you in action because explaining it doesn't really do it justice. You have to see how the workflow actually operates. First, the setup is incredibly fast. You don't need to install a heavy desktop application or change your IDE. You just need the Gemini CLI installed on your machine. If you have Node.js, it is literally one NPM command. Once you have the CLI, you run a simple command to install the Conductor extension. It takes literal seconds. I'll put the exact commands in the description, but it just works out of the box. So, I have my terminal open here. I am inside a completely empty folder. I'm going to use this to build a movie tracker app. Let's call it Cinelog. The idea is that I want a place to log movies I've watched, give them a rating, and maybe filter them by genre. Usually, at this point, I would just type a prompt, saying, \"Create a Next.js app for tracking movies.\" But with Conductor, we do it differently. I type `/conductor:setup`. Watch what happens. It doesn't just start vomiting code. It initiates an interview process. It acts like a senior engineer onboarding to a new team. It asks, \"Is this a new project or an existing one?\" I type \"new.\" Then it asks, \"What are we building?\" Now, look at the file structure in my Explorer. It just created a hidden folder called `.conductor`. product.md outlines the features. The AI is no longer guessing. It has a source of truth that it will reference for every single task we give it moving forward. But it doesn't just stop there. Now, we need to actually build the application. In Conductor, work is organized into what they call tracks. You can think of a track as a feature branch, a Jira ticket, or a specific unit of work. I type `/conductor:newTrack`. It asks me what this track is about. I say, \"Scaffold the project structure, set up the Tailwind configuration, and create the main movie card component.\" In a normal chat, the AI would just execute this. But Conductor generates a `plan.md` file first. It breaks down my request into granular steps. It asks me to review the plan. This is a huge deal, because if the AI misunderstood something, like if it planned to use the Pages router instead of the App router, I could catch it here and tell it to correct the plan before it wastes time writing bad code. I look at the plan. It looks solid. I hit approve. Now I type `conductor:implement`. This is where it gets interesting. The agent reads the plan it just created. It double-checks the `tech-stack.md` to ensure it is complying with my rules and then it starts executing. It runs the terminal commands to install the packages. It creates the files. That is majorly how it works. And this is significant because of how it handles team collaboration. Remember those Markdown files? `product.md`, `plan.md`, `tracks.md`? They live in your repo. This means you can commit them to GitHub. So, imagine you are working on a team. You set up the context, you define the tech stack, and you push the code. Your teammate pulls the repo down. When they run `Gemini CLI` on their machine, their agent sees the exact same context yours did. You are effectively sharing the AI's brain across your entire entire team. If you update the `product.md` to say, \"We are switching to a mobile-first design philosophy.\" The next time your teammate asks the AI to build a navbar, the AI will build it mobile-first. Because that constraint is now part of the shared project memory. It streamlines your workflow a lot. You stop having to repeat yourself. You stop having to paste your `package.json` into the chat window every time you start a new session. The AI just knows. And the visibility is great too. You can run `/conductor:status` at any time. And it gives you a high-level overview of exactly what the agent is working on. Which step of the plan it is executing. And what files it has touched. If it goes down a rabbit hole you don't like, you can run `conductor:revert`. And it intelligently rolls back that specific track without nuking your entire Git history. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

            "transcription": "There's an interesting question of why the Soviet Union collapsed when it did. The even more interesting question, why a system that was so centrally planned, monstrously inefficient, could survive for so long into the 20th century. But there are loads of dysfunctional places all over the planet that have been dysfunctional forever. And you look, well, why are they dysfunctional? To me the answer to that one in a way is the example of North Korea. You go of all countries that should fall, a place that has ongoing famines in the 21st century, and it used to be the richest part of the Korean peninsula. These authoritarian regimes are really good at maintaining the coercive powers. Think about it. Dictatorships are all over the world. It's a sad part of the human condition. They clearly know what they're up to. In the case of um, the Soviet Union, there were multiple intelligence organizations. That's what Stalin was using to keep track of everyone. So you want to monopolize information so that you know more information than other people. And then they have a whole bunch of people who are the winners, the nomenclatura, are the elites there. You make sure you pay all them off. I mean, think about it. Human societies, slaves, serfs, I mean we humans have been doing these things to each other for a long time."
