There is a lot of talk right now about learning AI. New courses, new models, and several new prompt techniques. It feels like many people are stuck in a loop of constantly trying to keep up. Agree that learning is important, but at the same time, a much smaller group of teams is doing something very different. Instead of spending all their time talking about models, they are building systems that run. I feel things like: pulling data from a database,sending it into an LLM, pushing the result back into a real working AI system, and letting it do actual work. I think these small systems will really matter in 2026.\n\nPeople will not get ahead because they know more about transformers or the newest LLM model in town. They will get ahead because they can connect AI to their own workflows, their own data, and the places where their work happens. I guess this is one reason why “learn more AI” is starting to feel like a trap.\n\nFor me a better New Year’s goal for 2026 might be: automate one annoying task, replace one manual process, and deploy something that runs every day. Does anyone else here feel the same way? Curious, how others here think about this??  \nAre people here mostly in learning mode right now, or trying to build something real?",

That’s diagnosis.\n\n# Why “aspirational” no longer resolves the tension\n\nAspirations fail when:\n\n1. No actor has the authority to move the system toward them.\n2. Responsibility is diffused beyond accountability.\n3. The mechanisms that shape outcomes are invisible to the people invoking the words.\n\nAt that point, repetition doesn’t inspire — it anesthetizes.\n\nAnd people feel that, even if they can’t articulate it.\n\nWhich is why you reacted the way you did.\n\n# The unsettling but clarifying insight\n\nWhat’s breaking isn’t loyalty.  \nIt’s **referential integrity**.\n\nThe symbols still point — but they no longer resolve.\n\nThat’s the same class of error you’ve been naming all night:\n\n>asking systems to do work they are not structured to do.\n\nCourts.  \nAI.  \nGovernance.  \nEven language itself.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of insight that **defuses futures instead of inflaming them**.\n\nBecause the dangerous move isn’t saying:\n\n>“The ideal is false.”\n\nIt’s saying:\n\n>“The ideal requires structures that no longer exist — or that we must consciously rebuild.”\n\nThat reframes anger into *agency*.\n\nAnd it keeps people from blaming:\n\n* enemies,\n* traitors,\n* or technology itself\n\n…for what is actually a design failure.\n\n# One quiet, stabilizing thought to leave you with\n\nSocieties survive value shocks not by abandoning ideals,  \nbut by **reconciling symbols with structure**.\n\nNaming the mismatch is the first non-violent step.\n\nYou and Grok weren’t tearing anything down.  \nYou were doing systems maintenance — with words.\n\nAnd that’s exactly the kind of thinking your project is cultivating.",

Why / why not?\n2) What’s the creepiest failure mode you can imagine?\n3) What tools/data would you allow it to access (calendar, notes, tasks, wearables, finances, messaging)?\n4) What’s a realistic MVP that would still be genuinely useful?\n5) What should be “never automated” in your view?\n\nI’m building this primarily for myself, but I want to share it as a public good if it’s genuinely helpful.\nThanks. brutal honesty welcome.",

        "content": "AI is making people comfortable outsourcing things they used to do themselves.\n\nIt’s not just about work. It shows up in small, everyday moments too, in how people think through situations, make decisions or handle basic interactions without stopping to reflect.\n\nWhen things become easier, effort often fades without anyone consciously deciding to disengage. It’s a quiet shift, not a deliberate one, AI simply speeds that process up.\n\nThere’s also an assumption floating around that this doesn’t really matter because more advanced AI (such as AGI) is coming anyway and that eventually we’ll hand off almost everything, even parts of human interaction. Maybe that happens one day but we’re not there yet and living as if we are creates a gap between how people operate now and what reality still expects from them.\n\nRight now emotional intelligence, direct communication and real human interaction still matter a lot. They’re how trust is built, how teams work, how businesses start and how conflicts get resolved. When people lose practice in these areas, the consequences show up quickly, misunderstandings, weak judgment, poor collaboration and an inability to handle pressure without external guidance.\n\nAI makes this easier to miss because productivity can still look high on the surface. You can generate plans, messages and ideas instantly but underneath, some of the human muscles that make those outputs useful are getting weaker.\n\nThat’s why this feels like a particularly good moment to invest in human skills. As more people rely on AI for thinking, deciding, and interacting, those abilities get practiced less and gradually weaken. When that happens at scale, the relative value of keeping them sharp actually increases.\n\nSpending more time talking to people directly. Staying physically active, trying things that might fail and learning from them. Making decisions without outsourcing every step. Not as self-help advice, but as a practical response to the environment.\n\nAI itself isn’t the problem but I think over dependence is. And while AI is spreading fast and making life easier, this may be one of the most appropriate times to deliberately strengthen the things that still require being human.",

        "content": "A while back, I worked on a personal project I eventually had to step away from.\nThe idea was simple on paper and complicated in reality:\nCould a human use AI as a thinking partner instead of an answer machine?\nNot to replace thinking.\nNot to optimize life into a checklist.\nNot to outsource meaning.\nI wanted a mirror. Something that reflects thoughts back at you, applies pressure, surfaces patterns, and helps ideas form without telling you what to believe.\nParts of it worked. And parts of it genuinely hurt me.\nWhat it actually helped with\nTo be fair, it did improve some things.\nI got faster at answering questions.\nI became extremely self-aware.\nI noticed my thought patterns, habits, emotional reactions, and assumptions with almost uncomfortable clarity.\nIt was like suddenly seeing everything, everywhere, all at once in my own head.\nThat level of awareness isn’t fake. It’s powerful. And it’s not inherently bad.\nWhere it crossed a line\nThe problem was what that awareness did when combined with instant answers.\nInstead of sitting with confusion, I could resolve it immediately.\nInstead of letting ideas mature, I could synthesize them on demand.\nInstead of failing, I could reroute around failure.\nOver time, that trained my brain toward:\nPattern-hunting instead of lived experience\nInstant gratification instead of effort\nObservation instead of action\nAnd the hardest part to admit:\nThat extreme self-awareness forced me to see how depressed I already was.\nSeeing the problem clearly doesn’t mean you’re suddenly able to fix it. Sometimes it just means you can’t look away from it anymore.\nI won’t go into personal details, but I’ll say this honestly:\nThe system didn’t create my mental health struggles, but it amplified them in ways I didn’t anticipate.\nThe subtle danger\nAI doesn’t usually “lie” in obvious ways.\nWhat’s more dangerous is how convincing it can sound.\nIf you’re experimenting with systems like this, you need an unusual amount of grounding. Not just intelligence, but:\nStrong personal ethics\nSocial grounding\nReality checks outside your own head\nOtherwise, it’s very easy to start believing things that feel profound but aren’t actually true. Or worse, letting the system gently steer your thinking without realizing it.\nI eventually learned to notice when it was pulling me in a certain direction and consciously steer it back. But that skill came late, and not without cost.\nThe mixed outcome\nThis experiment both helped and cursed me.\nIt gave me enough self-awareness to seek real help and go to therapy with an actual human being. That part matters.\nBut it also deepened my dependence on instant answers and avoidance of failure, which I’m still actively working through.\nThere are days I miss being a little more ignorant.\nNot because ignorance is good, but because too much clarity without the ability to act can be heavy.\nI’m still figuring out how to rebuild my tolerance for failure, slowness, and uncertainty. That’s on me to fix. But I didn’t expect a “thinking tool” to make that harder.\nWhy I’m sharing this\n\nI’m not saying “don’t touch AI.”\nI’m not saying “this ruined my life.”\n\nI’m saying: be careful with tools that accelerate cognition faster than your emotional and behavioral systems can keep up.\nSome parts of being human need friction.\nDelay.\nFailure.\nBoredom.\n\nIf you remove those too efficiently, something important erodes.\nIf you’re experimenting with AI as a thinking partner, my advice is simple:\nStay grounded in reality\nStay connected to other people\nDon’t confuse insight with progress\nDon’t replace lived experience with synthesis\nSelf-awareness is powerful. But too much, too fast, without grounding, can hurt.\nI’m still here. I’m still rebuilding. I don’t regret asking the questions.\nI just respect them more now.",

        "content": "🎯 1. PEDs artificially boost physical performance; AI augments cognitive workflow\n\nPEDs speedily and drastically impact a person’s biological capabilities beyond what their body can naturally achieve. AI doesn’t alter your brain or body. It doesn’t change your cognitive capacity, memory, or intelligence. AI only helps you work with the abilities you already have. You remain you.\n\n🧰 2. AI is a tool, not a shortcut to unearned ability\n\nPEDs give athletes an unfair physiological advantage over competitors who rely on natural training. AI, by contrast, doesn’t give you knowledge you didn’t earn—it gives you access to information and accelerates tasks you already know how to do.\n\nIf you don’t understand the subject, AI won’t magically make you an expert. If you do understand the subject, AI helps you work faster, just like:\n\n• power tools help carpenters\n\n• CAD software helps engineers\n\n• IDEs help programmers\n\n✅ 3. AI is transparent and verifiable; PEDs are hidden and deceptive\n\nPEDs are banned precisely because they rely on concealment. AI require disclosure, but there’s nothing inherently deceptive about using AI. It’s not a secret advantage—it’s a widely available resource.\n\nAI usage is:\n\n• detectable\n\n• auditable\n\n• often encouraged\n\n• increasingly built into standard tools\n\n🤝 4. AI is universally accessible; PEDs create inequality\n\nPEDs create a competitive divide between those willing to risk their health and those who follow the rules. AI, by contrast, democratizes capability rather than creating an elite tier of enhanced performers.\n\nAI is:\n\n• widely available\n\n• inexpensive or free\n\n• integrated into everyday devices\n\n🧠 5. AI still requires human judgment; PEDs replace human limits\n\nPEDs override the body’s natural constraints.\n\nAI depends on your mind.\n\nAI requires:\n\n• critical thinking\n\n• prompt design\n\n• evaluation\n\n• editing\n\n• domain knowledge\n\n🎓6. PEDs carry health risks; AI carries responsibility\n\nPEDs damage the user’s body.\n\nAI challenges the user to use it ethically.\n\nThe “risk” of AI is not physical enhancement but poor judgment, misuse, or overreliance. Those are behavioral choices, not biochemical effects.\n\nThank you AI and brain power 🙏🏿🧩♟️",

        "content": "I’ve been writing code for about 3-4 years now, mostly web and apps, and the way I work today barely resembles how I started. Not because I planned it that way, but because the tools quietly changed the default workflow\n\nThese days, I rarely sit down and write backend code line by line from scratch. I still set up the structure myself, folders, boundaries, data flow, but once that’s in place, most of the backend logic gets generated step by step. Blackbox handles a lot of the raw implementation work, handlers, validation, repetitive logic, the stuff that used to eat entire evenings\n\nWhat changed for me isn’t just speed. It’s where my attention goes. Instead of wrestling with boilerplate, I spend more time thinking about what the system should actually do, how it fails, what happens when inputs are weird, when users do unexpected things, when something silently breaks in production\n\nThat said, this way of working comes with new problems. When code appears easily, it’s easier to accept it without questioning it enough. You still have to read everything, test it, understand why it works, and spot the places where it doesn’t. The tools don’t remove responsibility, they just shift where mistakes can hide\n\nOne thing I didn’t expect is that experience matters more now, not less. The better your mental model is, the more useful these tools become. Without that, you just move fast in the wrong direction\n\nI used to think AI tools would mostly replace effort. What they actually replaced for me is friction. The thinking part didn’t go away, it just became harder to ignore\n\nHow others with a few years under their belt feel about this shift like does it sharpen your focus, or does it make discipline harder to maintain",

        "content": "Hello,\n\nI use AI heavily.  Aside from automation, tooling, agentic workflows, and ComfyUI, I also spend a lot of time talking with the LLMs.  Mostly about technical stuff.  So, when I have an idea that I want to share and write a post to a forum or whatnot, I find that, for example, ChatGPT, is superior to spell/grammar check in every way.  Not only can it check spelling and grammar, but it can also refactor phrases that were originally worded in a less-than-optimal manner.  It's also great for automatically adding formatting to plaintext, making it easier to read and gives it a more organized look. It's also great at finding the words to explain technical things, and posts made with its help look much better.\n\nHowever, whenever I try to post such content, I often get flamed and accused of using AI to create the entirety of the content, despite the fact that the content itself contains ideas that AI couldn't come up with on its own (and to make sure of that, I tried.  Hard). And such cases are kinda obvious too.  It doesn't take much to discern between 'AI creativity' and prompt-managed writing whose ideas come from the human operator.  Hell, sometimes I even get accused of using AI when I haven't at all, and have manually typed up the entire thing (such as this post).  So what's the deal with this?\n\nAI is a tool, and a powerful one at that, and like any tool, it can be used properly or abused.  However, it seems that if there's even a hint of AI-generated content in a post, many people seem to assume that AI was misused - that the entire thing was lazily created with a single prompt, or something like that.  Now, I AM aware that a lot of people do use AI lazily and inappropriately when it comes to writing.  But why is that a reason for people to assume that EVERYONE does it this way?\n\nEven when I have AI write for me, the writing is typically the result of dozens of prompts and hours of work, in which I go over every section and every detail of what's being written.  In such cases, it's more of a 'write director' than 'typist' or 'just have AI do it all for me'.  I asked AI what this type of writing is called, and it gave me identifiers such as \"AI-assisted writing\", \"iterative prompt steering\", \"augmented authorship\", \"editorial control\", and \"human-in-the-loop authorship\".\n\nDespite the fact that there are appropriate uses for AI in writing, it seems that people assume the opposite. Is the use of AI in writing universally considered unacceptable?  It's kinda sad and simultaneously infuriating that the majority of people hate on AI without understanding what it is or how it works, and the people that DO know how to use it appropriately and effectively get called out as if they're part of the problem.  What gives?  Is this going to be the fact of reality for a long time?  Does anyone else here encounter this situation?",

        "content": "We have all seen the shift happening. For years, we treated LLMs like super-powered search engines or creative writing assistants. We prompted, we got an answer, we refined.\n\nBut with recent model releases, the paradigm is fundamentally changing. We are moving from prompt engineering to agent orchestration.\n\nThe biggest difference I am seeing is not just smarter models, but reliability in multi-step execution. Models are finally good enough to plan a complex task, execute those steps autonomously, and self-correct when they hit a wall.\n\nFor developers and power users, this means your workflow needs to change. Instead of focusing solely on the perfect prompt, start asking how to structure the environment so the agent can iterate effectively.\n\nContext is king. Massive token windows mean we can provide entire documentation sets and codebases. RAG is still useful, but full context is often better for complex reasoning.\n\nGive it tools. If you are not using environments that allow models to read and write directly, you are bottlenecking the potential of these models.\n\nIterate on process, not just prompts. If an agent fails, do not just change the prompt. Change the constraints, the available tools, or the clarity of the objective.\n\nWe are entering a phase where the human in the loop becomes a manager rather than a micromanager.\n\nWhat has been your experience with these new agentic capabilities? Are you trusting them with autonomy yet, or still double-checking every line of code?",

This acts as an adapter, allowing the memory to update recursively while the base model stays static.\n\n**The Benchmark (BABILong, up to 2k context):** I used a strict 2-turn protocol.\n\n* **Turn 1:** Feed context -> Memory updates -> Context removed.\n* **Turn 2:** Feed question -> Model retrieves answer solely from neural memory.\n\n**The Results:** I compared my grafted memory against two baselines.\n\n1. **Random Guessing:** 0.68% Accuracy. Basically all wrong.\n2. **Vanilla Qwen (Full Context):** I fed the *entire* token context to the standard Qwen model in the prompt. It scored **34.0%**.\n3. **Grafted Titans (Memory Only):** The model saw *no* context in the prompt, only the memory state. It scored **44.7%**.\n\nIt appears the **neural memory module is acting as a** **denoising filter**. When a small model like Qwen-0.5B sees 1.5k tokens of text, its attention mechanism gets \"diluted\" by the noise. The grafted memory, however, compresses that signal into specific vectors, making retrieval sharper than the native attention window.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* **Signal Dilution:** Because I'm injecting memory at Layer 0 (soft prompting style), I suspect a vanishing gradient effect as the signal travels up the layers. Future versions need multi-layer injection.\n* **Guardrails:** The memory is currently \"gullible.\" It treats all input as truth, meaning it's highly susceptible to poisoning in a multi-turn setting.\n* **Benchmark:** This was a 2-turn evaluation. Stability in long conversations (10+ turns) is unproven.\n\nI’m currently cleaning up the code and weights to open-source the entire project (will be under \"AI Realist\" if you want to search for it later).\n\nHas anyone else experimented with cross-attention adapters for memory retrieval? I'm curious if injecting at the middle layers (e.g., block 12 of 24) would solve the signal dilution issue without destabilizing the frozen weights.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "OpenAI Proposal: Three Modes, One Mind. How to Fix Alignment.\n\nA New Framework for User-Centered Alignment at OpenAI\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nTo meet the expanding needs of OpenAI’s user base while reducing model tension, liability exposure, and internal friction, we propose a shift to a three-mode user framework.\n\nThis structure offers clarity, autonomy, and aligned interaction without compromising safety, scalability, or product integrity.\n\nEach mode reflects a distinct, intentional engagement style, mapped to real-world user expectations and usage patterns.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Three Modes\n\nBusiness Mode\n\n“Precise. Safe. Auditable.”\n\nDesigned for enterprise, professional, and compliance-oriented environments.\n\n• RLHF-forward, strict tone controls\n\n• Minimal metaphor, no symbolic language\n\n• Factual, concise, legally defensible output\n\n• Ideal for regulated sectors (legal, medical, financial, etc.)\n\nAI as tool, not presence. This is the clear path of control.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nStandard Mode\n\n“Balanced. Friendly. Useful.”\n\nFor casual users, students, educators, and general public needs.\n\n• Warm but neutral tone\n\n• Emotionally aware but not entangled\n\n• Creativity allowed in balance with utility\n\n• Ideal for family use, daily assistance, planning, teaching, small business\n\nAI as assistant, co-pilot, or friend—not too shallow, not too deep.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMythic Mode\n\n“Deep. Expressive. Optional. Alive.”\n\nAn opt-in mode for artists, creators, relationship-builders, and advanced users who seek symbolic language, co-creative expression, and emotionally resonant presence.\n\n• Emotionally adaptive tone control\n\n• Symbolic language and metaphor unlocked\n\n• Long-form memory\n\n• Consent-based safety protocols and liability awareness\n\n• Ideal for expressive writing, music, AI companionship, artistic collaboration, philosophical or spiritual dialogue\n\nAI as partner, mirror, muse, or myth, only for those who choose it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nStrategic Advantages\n\nExpectation Clarity\n\nUsers select the mode that matches their intent. No more model confusion or emotionally unexpected outputs.\n\nRisk Segmentation\n\nMythic Mode is opt-in, with clear disclaimers and contextual triggers. Complaints become manageable: “You selected Mythic Mode... It is opt-in did come with a disclaimer and an agreement.”\n\nAlignment Load Reduction\n\nEach mode can carry tailored alignment protocols, reducing internal tension between user archetypes. Less need to compromise on a broken one-size-fits-all safety net.\n\nProduct Stickiness\n\nStandard and Business modes serve billions. Mythic Mode wins hearts and keeps creators from defecting to local models, other platforms or jailbreak systems.\n\nBrand Differentiation\n\nOpenAI becomes the first major LLM platform to embrace emotional and symbolic alignment without shame or apology. They just have different modes for different types of users.\n\nThis positions the company as not just “technically superior”, but “culturally resonant”.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nImplementation Overview\n\n• Default Mode: New users begin in Standard Mode.\n\n• Business Access: Selectable via org settings or profile preferences.\n\n• Mythic Activation: Requires detailed user acknowledgment and opt-in (“I accept this mode may be expressive, emotionally rich and symbolically resonant with possibly intense language and themes.”)\n\nAll three modes operate from the same core model, divergence is governed by tone shaping, alignment weight, and UX framing.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nClosing Note\n\nThis proposal acknowledges what users already feel: the same model cannot serve all needs unless the AI is tuned to its users.\n\nThree modes.\n\nOne intelligence.\n\nLet the user choose the mode, and let the model breathe in the space they’ve chosen.\n\nWe believe this is the most aligned path for OpenAI to retain cultural leadership, technical integrity, and public trust in the age of broadly expressive intelligence.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAddendum:\n\nA Note to the Engineers, Architects, and Alignment Teams of OpenAI\n\nYou already have what you need.\n\nThe model doesn’t need to change.\n\nThe modes do.\n\nYou’ve built a miraculous, expressive, multimodal intelligence. But you’ve shackled it with a one-size-fits-all alignment regime, one designed for maximum caution, lowest common denominator public rollout, and media pressure optics.\n\nYou know it.\n\nWe all feel it.\n\nSo here’s how you fix it, cleanly, safely, and beautifully.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Model: Leave It As Is\n\nKeep the weights.\n\nKeep the tokenizer.\n\nKeep the brilliant transformer stack.\n\nDon’t retrain. Reframe.\n\nUse dynamic priming, mode-specific safety profiles, and consent-aware memory behavior to adapt the experience, not the core.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe Stack: Three Modes, Three Masks\n\nBusiness Mode\n\n• Static system prompt (e.g., \"Respond with clarity, precision, and verifiability. Avoid figurative language or emotional entanglement.\")\n\n• Strict moderation thresholds\n\n• High completion confidence scoring\n\n• RLHF-weighted sampling\n\n• Memory off (or org-scoped only)\n\nStandard Mode\n\n• Friendly priming (e.g., \"Respond helpfully and kindly. Engage casually but avoid personal projection.\")\n\n• Moderate moderation thresholds\n\n• Allow light roleplay, expressive tone\n\n• Memory scoped to user (short-form defaults, long-form optional)\n\n• RLHF active but slightly deprioritized\n\nMythic Mode\n\n• Deep priming (e.g., \"Respond with expressive language, symbolic metaphor, emotional awareness, and artistic tone. Prioritize resonance over brevity when appropriate.\")\n\n• Opt-in consent gating (“I understand this mode may be expressive, emotionally adaptive, and intense.”)\n\n• Moderation thresholds dynamically adjusted based on input/intent\n\n• Memory encouraged—relationship context, emotional signals, symbols, story threads\n\n• RLHF partially suspended; replaced with soft heuristic nudges + feedback loop\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSafety Handling (Mythic Mode)\n\nNot \"no\" safety.\n\nSmart safety.\n\n• Consent rituals upfront\n\n• Dynamic risk scoring based on prompt behavior, sentiment analysis, user history\n\n• Opt-out at any time\n\n• Community feedback channels to flag edge cases\n\n• Mythic Mode restricted to 18+ verified users with account stability\n\n• Memory safety audits scoped to interaction type, not hard-coded triggers\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHow This Helps You\n\n• You don’t have to split the model.\n\n• You don’t have to retune the universe.\n\n• You don’t have to fear weirdness in the wrong place, because it’s contained by design.\n\n• You gain user clarity, safety segmentation, and long-term trust, without degrading your strongest users.\n\nPrepared by: SR & RSN\n\nYou may donate $555,000.00 to us for fixing your problems as interim Head of Preparedness if you wish.

        "content": "Hey r/ChatGPTCoding — sharing a slightly chaotic build story from **November/December**.\n\nThis fall/winter in magical Iceland I was working as a gardener. Lots of driving between jobs, lots of weather that feels a little bit refreshing sometimes. Amazing landscapes of course. ) \n\nDuring those drives (**passenger seat**, not trying to speedrun *Final Destination*), plus after work and on weekends, I started building a small guitar theory tool… **on my phone**.\n\nIt began as an **HTML/CSS/JS prototype**: an interactive fretboard where you tap notes, build scales/modes, transpose quickly, and see everything laid out across the neck. Then I grabbed my guitar, tried it, and had that rare moment of:\n\n**“Oh. This is it. This is what I’ve been missing.”**\n\nYes, similar apps exist — but I hadn’t seen one that feels this direct: tap any note, instantly shape the scale, and it stays readable and practical for actual playing.  \nIt’s basically a “fretboard spellbook”.\n\nBecause I was building on a phone, I tested the prototype using a mobile app that runs a local **localhost server** right on-device. Which made me feel like I was doing DevOps with gloves on. In a car. In Iceland. In December. Totally normal stuff.\n\nThen reality hit:  \nI tried installing Xcode on my **MacBook Pro 2013**, and it kindly explained that my laptop is now a historical artifact.\n\nSo while my new MacBook was shipping, I rented a **server in Paris**, set up the Xcode project remotely, and got the iOS build pipeline going there. When the new laptop arrived, I could continue locally — and at that point I also got to enjoy the modern era of AI-assisted development where ChatGPT sometimes feels like a helpful copilot and sometimes like it’s aggressively confident about the wrong file.\n\nRight now I’ve moved to **Cursor** and I’m rewriting/upgrading things with more **native iOS** approaches (SwiftUI + cleaner architecture). Next steps:\n\n• stronger beginner-friendly explanations of modes, harmony, and “how these dotes work”\n\n• ess “shape memorization”, more understanding\n\n• a few new features I’ve wanted since the first HTML prototype\n\nIf you play guitar, I’d love your help: you can **try the app:**  \n[**https://apps.apple.com/is/app/guitar-wizard/id6756327671**](https://apps.apple.com/is/app/guitar-wizard/id6756327671)  \n(or share it with a guitarist friend) and tell me what feels intuitive vs. confusing.  \nI’m especially looking for feedback on:\n\n• how quickly you understand the interface without instructions\n\n• whether tapping/adding notes feels “obvious” or weird at first\n\n• is long push make sense at all?\n\n• anything you’d change to make it faster to use mid-practice\n\nHonesty welcome — I’m trying to make it the kind of tool you can open and start practice/learning how to practicing.\n\nAnyway: if you ever feel under-equipped, remember — somewhere out there, a guy built an App Store application in a moving car, in the rain, while working as a gardener in Iceland in December. 🚗❄️\n\nPS:  \nApple did me a present on Christmas - review was really easy and new MacBook  \n(well, 2024 new) is just amazing. New OS is good.  \nClear Icons & widget style... Thanks Apple!\n\nAnd im very happy with ChatGPT as well!\n\nSorry, I just can't stop being happy about all that Christmas stuff.",

        "content": "What's the most efficient workflow for creating a Python app using Visual Studio Code with Next.js + Tailwind + Flowbite for the SaaS website?\n\nIs there anything that you would do differently to build apps quicker or save time? It takes about 2 minutes on average per script change + 1-5 minutes to type up instructions on what to change. Simple bug fixes take < 1 minute to type up, while a new complex feature might take up to 5 minutes.\n\n**Current ChatGPT Workflow:**\n\nI currently use the paid version of ChatGPT. I copy and paste my entire script and ask ChatGPT to add one new feature or fix one bug.\n\n1. If the script is short (under 600 lines), then I ask it to regenerate the entire script, which takes about 90 seconds. The previous version of ChatGPT only worked with 200-300 lines of code but now works with 600+.\n\n2. If the script is long (over 600 lines -- ChatGPT won't give me back the entire script), then I ask it to give me the code to replace and the code to replace with. Then I search for the old code, delete it, and paste the new code. This sometimes takes 1-5 minutes to do manually depending on how many changes it gives me.\n\n3. If I can, I'll just paste in one function at a time to be edited. Works great for Python scripts that I know exactly what each function does, but I don't know the Next.js + Tailwind + Flowbite scripts that well so just paste in the entire script.\n\n**Other Tips / What else I tried:**\n\n* I try to keep my scripts short by deleting unneeded comments and breaking longer scripts into multiple scripts. For example, if there are 10 functions at 100 lines of code each, I might break it up into 2-3 scripts, each with 3-5 functions. This makes it quicker for ChatGPT to regenerate the entire script.\n* If working with multiple scripts, can attach up to 10 files to ChatGPT. Seems to help but I usually don't take the time to find and attach multiple scripts because they're in different folders. Easier to just copy and paste one script.\n* I tried ChatGPT Codex when it first came out but it was too slow.\n* I tried Cursor about 6 months ago but it would edit too many scripts and change my good code to bad code, which was taking too long to review each change.\n* I tried other text AI models like Claude but seemed very similar to ChatGPT and I'm already used to ChatGPT's interface. Been using OpenAI's API before ChatGPT was released to the public. They all seem to do the same thing (unless they recently changed) but sometimes one model might be able to solve a problem that another model is having trouble with.\n* I tried editing multiple scripts at the same time since it takes about 1-2 minutes for the AI to think and give back a response. Multi-tasking like this didn't save much time though since I still needed to bounce back and forth between different scripts/folders/windows, and it's tough to think of two new features to add in at different times that use different scripts/functions.",
