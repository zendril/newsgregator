*   **Significant Developments in AI Court Cases and Rulings:** A comprehensive round-up of over 100 AI-related court cases reveals critical legal precedents and ongoing disputes. Key findings include:
    *   **Copyright for AI-Generated Works:** US, Czech, and Mexican courts have denied copyright protection to works solely authored by AI, asserting that only humans can be authors. Conversely, Chinese courts have granted copyright to AI-generated textual and pictorial works, emphasizing human involvement in guiding the AI.
    *   **Data Scraping & Fair Use:** Numerous class-action lawsuits allege copyright infringement due to AI companies scraping copyrighted material (text, graphic images, sound recordings, video, source code) for training AI models without permission or compensation. Court rulings on fair use in this context are mixed and evolving, with some finding AI training "transformative" and others emphasizing market harm to content creators.
    *   **AI Liability and Discrimination:** Cases address AI in areas like facial recognition leading to wrongful arrests, algorithmic housing discrimination, and even AI-chatbot involvement in teen suicide.
    *   **Voice Misappropriation & Persona Rights:** Rulings and pending cases are addressing the misappropriation of human vocal tonalities and the unauthorized creation of AI performances based on celebrity personas.
    *   **Patent Law:** International courts consistently refuse to grant patents to AI devices as sole inventors, upholding the human authorship requirement.
