Hi. Welcome to another video. So, Cline has just dropped 3.16, and it's packed with some really neat upgrades and fixes that I thought I'd cover for you. These updates have been busy, and there's some good stuff here. Let me just tell you about the upgrades, and then we'll jump into what some of them mean. First up, and this one's pretty big, they've added a new workflow feature. This allows you to create and manage workflow files that can be injected into conversations via slash commands. Basically, it's super similar to the WindSurf feature that we saw, which allowed us to write a markdown file that lets you mention multiple steps and save it as a workflow you can refer to in chat with a slash command. So, you can make a GitHub commit and push workflow that commits the changes for you, then pushes it as a pull request, or one that makes branches for you. You can also make one that uses some other API and does other stuff accordingly. It's basically all in your hands. This is going to be super handy for automating common tasks or bringing in predefined instructions, which is kind of awesome. Then, we've got a collapsible recent task list. This is great if you're presenting something or just want a cleaner interface, as you can now hide your task history. It's a nice little touch, and I really like it. For all you Vertex AI users, there's a new global endpoint option. This should give you higher availability and hopefully cut down on those pesky 429 errors. Cline will now also detect new users and display special components and guidance to help them get started. That's pretty thoughtful for onboarding and should help you out if you're a new coder. And for the web developers, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense has been added to the recommended extensions list, which is a nice little productivity booster. They've also fixed that annoying bug where you'd get eternal loading states if the last message was a checkpoint. So, no more getting stuck there, which is great. There's also an improvement to settings organization with the VS Code advanced settings being migrated to the settings webview. It just makes things a bit tidier. Another really useful addition is the new enable auto approve toggle switch. This means you can easily turn auto-approve functionality on or off without losing your specific action settings. You don't have to reconfigure everything, which is kind of cool. If you're using Gemini models, the retry handling has been improved with better UI feedback, showing retry progress during API request attempts, so you're not left guessing if it's working or not, which is good to see. They've also squashed a memory leak issue that could pop up during long sessions with multiple tasks. So, Cline should be more stable for those marathon coding sessions. And tied into that Gemini retry improvement, the UI for Gemini model retry attempts now has clearer status updates. There's also a fix for quick actions functionality in the auto-approve settings. So, that's working as expected now. And finally, they've updated the UI styling for auto-approve menu items to conserve a bit of space. Every little bit helps, right? These are the main upgrades in 3.16. Now, let me dive a bit deeper into a few of these that I think are particularly interesting. But before we do that, let me tell you about NinjaTools. NinjaTools is a crazy AI platform where you pay once and access all AI models and agents at one place. It combines all the best AI models and experiences. It allows you to save over $600 per year compared to having separate subscriptions. You get access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini, and a ton of other models in one subscription. You even get some more cool options like AI video generation, image generation, music generation, and document chats. You can also use their playground to compare multiple AI responses at once. The best part is that it just starts from $11 per month. That gives you more than 1,000 chat messages, 30 AI image generation, and five music generation. While there is also some even more advanced plans if you need them. Make sure to check NinjaTools out and save some money on your subscription while you're at it. Also, make sure to use my coupon code AICODEKING20 to get an additional 20% off. Now, back to the video. First of all, make sure that you upgrade Cline to the latest version to check these out. That new workflow feature is probably the headliner for 3.16. Imagine you have a common set of instructions, like a checklist for creating a new component, or a standard debugging procedure, or a workflow automation that you may want to do. So, you can now save that as a workflow markdown file. To do it, you can just hit this rules option. And here, you can see the workflows option as well. Here, you can hit the add option, and this will ask you for a name. So, just put that in and then it will open up the file for you, which is generally located in the Cline rules workflow folder. So, here, you can mention whatever it is that you want this workflow to do. Let's say that I want this to create a new Git branch for me and get me switched to it. So, I'll ask it to first create a new Git branch with the terminal command. And then I'll ask it to check out to the branch as well. That's all I wanted to do. Now, we can just save it. And if I hit the slash command, then it will allow you to just use the workflow that you just created. I'm going to ask it to make me a branch. And this will just get on it and use it. So, this is good. And you can create multiple workflows and easily reference them. It is going to be super helpful. And if you combine this with MCP servers, then it can be really awesome. This is going to be a huge time saver for repetitive stuff and for ensuring consistency, which is kind of awesome. Then there's the collapsible recent task list. It's a small UI tweak, but really handy. If you're doing a live demo, pair programming, or just prefer a less cluttered view, you can now just tuck away your task history. No more accidentally showing off a long list of previous tasks if you don't want to, which is kind of neat. And that enable auto-approve toggle switch is a quality of life improvement I really appreciate. Before, if you wanted to temporarily stop auto-approvals, you might have had to go in and change your detailed settings and then change them back. Now, it's just a simple toggle. You can flip it off, do what you need to do with manual approvals, and then flip it back on, and all your previous auto-approve rules for different actions are still there. That's super convenient. Also, for those of us using the Gemini models, seeing that improved UI feedback during retries is definitely welcome. Instead of just seeing a spinner and wondering if it's stuck or if the API is just slow, you'll actually see the progress of the retry attempts. It just makes the whole experience feel a bit more transparent and less frustrating when there are network hiccups or API load, which is good to see. You can also use Kilo Code as well, which is a fork of Cline and Roo Code that brings the best features from both of them into one, allowing you to get the best of both worlds. And I've been using it a bit these days, and it gives you $20 of free credits that you can use with Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and much more for free, which is awesome. For the MCP server and Cline, I've been using the Context 7 and Git MCP, as well as Serper Search, and Fetch, which is also kind of cool. So, you can use that accordingly as well. I've been using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model these days, as it is the best one to use these days, and much cheaper and better than Sonnet for me. So, those are the main highlights for Cline 3.16. Definitely some cool stuff in there to make things smoother and add some powerful new capabilities, especially with that workflow feature. Go ahead and update if you haven't already and try these new features out. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.

[ 0m0s108ms - 0m3s948ms ] Hi, welcome to another video.
[ 0m8s308ms - 0m10s98ms ] See man, I'm fed up with using a ton of models.
[ 0m10s98ms - 0m13s528ms ] Through different providers and on different sites.
[ 0m14s358ms - 0m18s288ms ] And paying for all these different subscriptions.
[ 0m18s288ms - 0m27s68ms ] I mean, it costs a ton these days to be an AI fanatic like me because you need to have like 20 subscriptions to use all the latest tech.
[ 0m28s648ms - 0m35s448ms ] But today, I have something that aims to fix this and this one is called Mammouth.
[ 0m35s448ms - 0m37s238ms ] Mammouth is an all-in-one AI platform.
[ 0m37s238ms - 0m57s718ms ] That basically gives you all kinds of AI models and tools you'd ever want, like Claude, Open AI's GPT and O4 models, Meta's Lama models, as well as Mistral, Grock, Gemini, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Midjourney and Flux all in one place and for just one subscription of $10 a month.
[ 1m1s598ms - 1m9s368ms ] It even has the new GPT image model, which is the best currently, as well as Recraft, which is also great.
[ 1m10s228ms - 1m21s308ms ] Just for context, all this stuff, if taken separately, would easily cost you upwards of $100 and here it only costs $10, which is a 10 times saving.
[ 1m23s218ms - 1m24s848ms ] It's really awesome.
[ 1m24s848ms - 1m27s48ms ] But it's not just about the models either.
[ 1m27s48ms - 1m34s148 ] Because it also gives you some great features built in, which allow you to use these models in different ways.
[ 1m34s148ms - 1m55s668ms ] Like there's the option of custom Mammouths, which basically allows you to set up your custom Mammouth with tailored context to enhance its ability to support you effectively on your projects.
[ 1m55s668ms - 2m19s148ms ] So, it's basically like custom agents that you can make for specific tasks with custom instructions, which is kind of cool, you also get one click reprompting, which allows you to quickly send your prompt to another model and check the response from the other model in seconds, you can compare which model performs the best for your tasks, and this is also great to cross check responses with another model for checking if the model is hallucinating or anything like that.
[ 2m21s328ms - 2m28s558ms ] It also allows you to easily upload images and documents to extract insights.
[ 2m28s558ms - 3m10s988ms ] It also has a progressive web app, or PWA, implementation that allows you to easily install an app on Mac, Windows, iPhone, and Android as well, and access it super easily with one click if you wish to do that, it's also got the AI web search capability that allows you to basically just write a prompt and it can do web searches for you and give you the latest and up-to-date answers, it can use open perplex as well as perplexity for this capability and give you the most up-to-date and correct answers for your question, which is kind of cool as well.
[ 3m10s988ms - 3m17s918ms ] Now, let's test it out and let me show you all the features that it has.
[ 3m17s918ms - 3m25s868ms ] So, this is how it looks when you get it, you can see the sidebar on the left, where you'll see your threads as you make them.
[ 3m26s378ms - 3m36s788ms ] While on the right, you can see the main area, which is where you can send messages and start a new chat thread and just talk with the AI model of your choice.
[ 3m37s208ms - 3m49s388ms ] You can type in your prompt here and you can also attach documents or images here as well and talk about stuff with the context of your images and documents as well.
[ 3m50s468ms - 4m4s38ms ] Then, you can also select between four options that you have here, which are the options of text models, image models, web research, as well as reasoning models.
[ 4m4s38ms - 4m16s798ms ] So, if I select the text model option here, then it will allow you to select between all of the models that you'd want, like Lama, Mistral, DeepSeek, GPT, Claude, Gemini, and even Grock.
[ 4m17s648ms - 4m54s538ms ] You can also select the image models as well, and the image model lineup is actually really good, you get the GPT image option, which is currently the best, and this is what was being used for creating the Ghibli images that you saw on the internet, anyway, you also get the Recraft option, which is also a great model, as well as Flux, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and the SVG option, the SVG option is a variant of Recraft that can basically generate SVG images like icons and stuff, which is also cool.
[ 4m55s538ms - 5m11s408ms ] You can also see the web search options here, which allow you to select between multiple web search tools like OpenPerplex, GPT web, Perplexity, as well as Perplexity's deep research option, which is all pretty cool.
[ 5m11s408ms - 5m25s218ms ] Then, you also have the reasoning models variant that allows you to select between Open AI's O4, DeepSeek's R1, as well as Gemini 2.5 Pro as well.
[ 5m25s218ms - 5m32s858ms ] You also have the advanced voice mode, which basically allows you to do audio chat with the GPT 4 O model, which is the same as what you get in Chat GPT.
[ 5m33s848ms - 5m39s888ms ] So, you can talk and everything through here as well.
[ 5m39s888ms - 5m46s728ms ] Now, let's start with the text models option.
[ 5m46s728ms - 5m54s178ms ] So, let's select the text models option here and let me just ask it for something.
[ 5m54s178ms - 5m55s798ms ] I'm going to use the Gemini option.
[ 5m55s798ms - 5m59s238ms ] Because I like it the best.
[ 5m59s238ms - 6m4s468ms ] Now, once I do that, you can see that it gets started on it and we get the response over here as well, in just a bit, which is kind of great.
[ 6m4s958ms - 6m22s768ms ] You can also reprompt it to generate the same response with another model using this reprompt option, and this will just create a new thread that starts with the same message, but with the other model that we selected here.
[ 6m22s768ms - 6m24s48ms ] Now, let me also show you the image generation stuff.
[ 6m24s838ms - 6m36s288ms ] Here, you can just enter whatever it is you want to create, and then just select the image model that you want to use, and it will get on it and generate the image for you in just a bit.
[ 6m36s288ms - 6m45s738ms ] The best option that I like to use is the GPT image option, which is the best as of now and really great for creative tasks.
[ 6m45s738ms - 6m48s798ms ] Anyway, after this, we also have the web search options.
[ 6m48s798ms - 6m51s648ms ] Which allows you to get the latest info and stuff like that.
[ 6m52s468ms - 7m4s338ms ] So, I like the Perplexity deep research for complex tasks and searches, while I like the simple Perplexity for simple tasks.
[ 7m4s338ms - 7m8s418ms ] I can just select it and ask something recent.
[ 7m8s418ms - 7m18s968ms ] And then it will just go ahead and do the searches and give you the answer, and the sources are listed here and everything, which is also good to see.
[ 7m19s568ms - 7m31s408ms ] You also have the reasoning option, and they work the same, apart from the fact that DeepSeek also shows you the reasoning traces, as the reasoning traces for that are available.
[ 7m31s408ms - 7m33s908ms ] So, this is kind of good.
[ 7m34s918ms - 7m39s768ms ] Apart from all this stuff, there is the option of custom Mammouths.
[ 7m39s768ms - 7m45s178ms ] These are basically like Chat GPT or Claude projects if you have used those.
[ 7m45s178ms - 7m50s588ms ] It allows you to create a custom agent.
[ 7m50s588ms - 8m21s638ms ] And that will allow you to put in custom documents and instructions for it to follow or reference, which will allow you to customize it for your specific project or style, so if you're working on a project, then you can upload related documents and give it some custom instructions and make it work accordingly, here, I gave it some documentation about design libraries, and now it can use those design libraries and generate related code for me, which is kind of cool, you can use it for different stuff based on what you want to achieve.
[ 8m21s638ms - 8m37s878ms ] Like, you can give it your expense sheet and make it summarize that or chat about it, or you can give it research papers or anything like that, and it can just do the stuff you want accordingly.
[ 8m38s778ms - 8m44s878ms ] This is majorly what Mammouth is all about.
[ 8m44s878ms - 8m50s538ms ] It is just an all-in-one platform that is simple and just gives you all the models and features that you expect from an AI platform.
[ 8m50s538ms - 8m54s768ms ] And that too, for super cheap.
[ 8m54s768ms - 8m56s68ms ] It starts from $10.
[ 8m56s68ms - 9m7s938ms ] Which is what most of you would want, and it is unlimited text messages in this with 50 premium images and unlimited messages with Flux, which is insanely good value.
[ 9m7s938ms - 9m18s608ms ] You also have the $20 and $60 plans with higher limits if you want to consider that.
[ 9m18s608ms - 9m23s218ms ] So, you can go ahead and use it and save some money with it while you're at it.
[ 9m23s218ms - 9m23s898ms ] Overall, it's pretty cool.
[ 9m24s532ms - 9m26s692ms ] Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.
[ 9m26s692ms - 9m32s822ms ] You can also donate via super thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.
[ 9m32s822ms - 9m33s782ms ] I'll see you in the next video.
[ 9m33s782ms - 9m39s382ms ] Bye.

```
[ 0m0s649ms - 0m7s759ms ] Hi, welcome to another video.
[ 0m8s249ms - 0m16s719ms ] So, VectorShift has just rolled out something really exciting, a new AI workflow mode called Conversational AI Workflows.
[ 0m17s189ms - 0m24s849ms ] Let me tell you, it's a game changer for building truly custom and interactive chatbots.
[ 0m25s239ms - 0m27s369ms ] It's pretty awesome to see them add this level of control.
[ 0m28s179ms - 0m30s349ms ] First of all, if you don't know about VectorShift.
[ 0m30s349ms - 0m43s549ms ] It's an AI automation platform that allows you to make workflows where you can connect any data source to AI, create custom workflows, and build the AI agents you need.
[ 0m43s929ms - 0m50s199ms ] You could already create custom workflows, and I have a ton of videos on that, which you can check out.
[ 0m50s679ms - 0m54s509ms ] But now, they have launched conversational AI workflows.
[ 0m54s999ms - 1m5s299ms ] Now, you're probably wondering how this is different from the standard pipelines.
[ 1m5s299ms - 1m6s529ms ] Well, the standard way is usually input to output, one straight shot.
[ 1m6s919ms - 1m14s319ms ] But with these new conversational nodes, you get to define exactly what happens at every single stage of the conversation.
[ 1m14s819ms - 1m22s19ms ] Think about it, you can guide the user step-by-step, which is super great for so many use cases.
[ 1m22s19ms - 1m25s789ms ] Let's dive right into the no-code builder and see how this works.
[ 1m26s589ms - 1m31s279ms ] When you go to create a new pipeline, you'll see an option for conversational.
[ 1m32s39ms - 1m39s29ms ] Clicking that, you'll notice a start flag pops up on your canvas, that's where your chat begins.
[ 1m39s819ms - 1m48s579ms ] And look, there's a whole new conversational tab on the left with new nodes, you've got talk nodes and listen nodes.
[ 1m49s159ms - 1m58s559ms ] Talk nodes are for the bot to send stuff, like a message node for text, or you can send images, cards, or carousels.
[ 1m58s979ms - 2m9s569ms ] Listen nodes are for when the bot needs to get input, like the capture response node to grab what the user types, or you can even add buttons.
[ 2m10s479ms - 2m17s149ms ] So, let's build a simple lead collection chatbot to really see this in action, just like they showed.
[ 2m18s249ms - 2m29s889ms ] First up, from the start flag, we'll drag in a message node from the talk nodes, let's make it ask, "What is your name?"
[ 2m29s889ms - 2m32s369ms ] Then, we need to wait for the user to actually type their name, right?
[ 2m33s409ms - 2m40s279ms ] So, we connect a capture response node, which is a listen node to our message.
[ 2m40s279ms - 2m54s569ms ] Next, we'll add another message node and ask, "What is your email?" and you guessed it, another capture response node connected to that to get the email.
[ 2m54s909ms - 2m59s399ms ] What's super cool is that when you run this, you can see the chatbot actually waits at each capture step.
[ 2m59s399ms - 3m3s89ms ] It doesn't just rush through.
[ 3m3s89ms - 3m13s929ms ] It'll ask, "What is your name?" wait for your input, then, "What is your email?" and wait again, this gives you that fine-grained control.
[ 3m14s359ms - 3m17s339ms ] Okay, so we've got the name and email.
[ 3m17s859ms - 3m21s349ms ] Let's make this even more useful.
[ 3m21s349ms - 3m25s99ms ] Say we want to save these leads to a Google sheet.
[ 3m25s99ms - 3m37s929ms ] To do that, we can just drag in a Google Sheets node, you can configure it to add new row, you'll pick your spreadsheet file and it'll show you the columns.
[ 3m37s929ms - 3m43s559ms ] Now, here's the magic.
[ 3m43s559ms - 3m57s719ms ] The first capture node for the name might be called something like capture zero in its output, you map that to your name column in Google Sheets, the second capture for email, say capture one, maps to your email column.
[ 3m57s719ms - 4m11s649ms ] Now, when the user provides their name and email, after both are captured, the workflow will automatically add a new row to your Google Sheet with that info, that is super great as well.
[ 4m11s649ms - 4m13s609ms ] But wait, there's more.
[ 4m13s609ms - 4m19s509ms ] What if after collecting the lead info, you want the bot to be a helpful AI assistant.
[ 4m19s509ms - 4m28s329ms ] Let's add another message node after the Google sheet step, saying something like, "Thanks, how can I help you today?"
[ 4m28s329ms - 4m35s19ms ] Then, a capture response node to get the user's question.
[ 4m35s19ms - 4m53s599ms ] Now for the AI part, we can build a simple rag or retrieval augmented generation setup, drag in a knowledge base node, you can point this to a website, like the VectorShift URL to scrape it for context.
[ 4m53s599ms - 5m12s69ms ] Connect the user's question from that capture node to this knowledge base, then, drag in an LLM node like OpenAI, in the prompt, you tell it to answer the question based on the provided context, the question will come from that capture node, and the context will come from your knowledge base reader output.
[ 5m12s69ms - 5m30s679ms ] Finally, take the response from the LLM and send it back to the user with another message node.
[ 5m30s679ms - 5m33s279ms ] This is where it gets really powerful.
[ 5m33s279ms - 5m36s239ms ] You can have deterministic steps for lead collection and then seamlessly transition into an AI powered Q and A, and you know what else is super cool?
[ 5m36s239ms - 5m37s459ms ] It's looping.
[ 5m37s459ms - 5m52s899ms ] So, after the bot answers a question, you probably want the user to be able to ask another one, just drag the connection from your last message node, the LLM's answer and loop it back to the "How can I help you today?"
[ 5m52s899ms - 5m56s659ms ] message node.
[ 5m56s659ms - 6m2s579ms ] VectorShift even highlights the loop for you, they've also added a neat little feature for these loops, cyclic input.
[ 6m2s579ms - 6m6s99ms ] This means the first time it asks, "How can I help?"
[ 6m6s99ms - 6m16s79ms ] But on subsequent loops, it can say something different like, "Do you have any additional questions?"
[ 6m16s79ms - 6m34s779ms ] This makes the conversation flow much more naturally, you can see it in action, ask one question, get an answer, then it asks if you have more questions, ask another and it does the same, it's pretty great.
[ 6m34s779ms - 6m36s419ms ] All right, so you've built this amazing conversational AI.
[ 6m36s419ms - 6m40s769ms ] How do you deploy it? It's actually the same straightforward process as other chatbots and VectorShift.
[ 6m40s769ms - 6m45s339ms ] Just hit deploy changes.
[ 6m45s339ms - 6m51s569ms ] Go to export and select chatbot, give your chatbot a name.
[ 6m51s569ms - 7m5s339ms ] There's even an additional field for these conversational chatbots called message delay, which lets you set the time you want between each message from the bot, maybe half a second or so.
[ 7m5s339ms - 7m14s379ms ] Then just export it, you can embed it right into your website using a script or I frame, or just use the chat GPT style interface they provide to test it out.
[ 7m14s889ms - 7m29s449ms ] So, that's the new conversational AI workflows in VectorShift.
[ 7m29s449ms - 7m42s869ms ] This is super exciting for anyone who wants to build more guided, interactive, and intelligent chatbots.
[ 7m42s869ms - 7m56s59ms ] Whether it's for advanced lead generation, step-by-step customer support, or any process where you need to control the conversation flow precisely, is just fantastic, overall, it's pretty cool.

```
*   **Key Points:**
    *   **Conversational AI Workflows:** VectorShift, an AI automation platform, has launched a new workflow mode specifically for building custom, interactive chatbots.
    *   **Fine-Grained Control:** Unlike standard input-to-output pipelines, this mode allows defining actions at every stage of a conversation using "talk nodes" (bot messages, images, carousels) and "listen nodes" (capture user input, add buttons).
    *   **Step-by-Step Guidance:** Enables the creation of chatbots that guide users through a process, demonstrated with a lead collection example (gathering name, email, and waiting for user input at each step).
    *   **Integration & Advanced Features:** Supports integration with external services like Google Sheets to save collected data. It can transition seamlessly from deterministic data collection to an AI-powered Q&A using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by connecting to a knowledge base and LLM.
    *   **Looping & Cyclic Input:** Features allow conversations to loop back, enabling users to ask follow-up questions, with "cyclic input" providing varied prompts for subsequent loops to ensure natural flow.
    *   **Deployment:** Chatbots can be easily deployed by embedding them into websites or using a provided testing interface, with an option to set message delays for natural pacing.
*   **Summary:** VectorShift has introduced "Conversational AI Workflows," a new mode within its AI automation platform designed for building highly interactive and custom chatbots. This mode offers fine-grained control over conversational flow through "talk nodes" (for bot output) and "listen nodes" (for user input), enabling step-by-step guidance. It supports integrations like saving data to Google Sheets, dynamic transitions to AI-powered Q&A using RAG, and features like looping and cyclic input for natural dialogue. The platform provides a streamlined deployment process, including embedding options and configurable message delays.
