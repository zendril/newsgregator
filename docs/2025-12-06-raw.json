Wrongfully so, as I never used my Facebook account for illicit advertising, cyberbullying, scamming or promoting violence. \n\nQuestion is, why even use AI if it will make critical errors like this for which either AI has to be recalibrated and rerun, or an actual human has to go through reviewing all the erroneously suspended Facebook accounts? It seems like AI hasn't really been helpful in this case, or at least, it resulted in a mistake that will cost them (i.e. more people getting wrongfully suspended means less people will be encountering ads and providing ad revenue for Facebook).\n\nRedditors frequently talk of \"this will be used to train AI\". So should I accept crap like this because it will train AI so that future generations can enjoy reliable AI?\n\nBTW, I clicked the \"Fix issue\" link, followed the instructions and provided my selfie. Now they are reviewing my details in order to reinstate my account. They claimed that they'd take 1 day, so far it's been 4. Not really holding my breath because some people have had it take so long that it passed the 180 day limit where their account gets disabled.",

Shift from Text Generation to Reasoning Models**\n\nThe release of reasoning models like o1 triggered a major transition from simple text-completion to multi-step, deliberate reasoning in real-world AI usage.\n\n**2. Open-Source Models Rapidly Gaining Share**\n\nOpen-source models now account for roughly one-third of usage, showing strong adoption and growing competitiveness against proprietary models.\n\n**3. Rise of Medium-Sized Models (15B–70B)**\n\nMedium-sized models have become the preferred sweet spot for cost-performance balance, overtaking small models and competing with large ones.\n\n**4. Rise of Multiple Open-Source Family Models**\n\nThe open-source landscape is no longer dominated by a single model family; multiple strong contenders now share meaningful usage.\n\n**5. Coding & Productivity Still Major Use Cases**\n\nBeyond creative usage, programming help, Q&A, translation, and productivity tasks remain high-volume practical applications.\n\n**6. Growth of Agentic Inference**\n\nUsers increasingly employ LLMs in multi-step “agentic” workflows involving planning, tool use, search, and iterative reasoning instead of single-turn chat.\n\n\n\nI found **2, 3 & 4 insights most exciting as they reveal the rise and adoption of open-source models**. Let me know insights from your experience with LLMs.\n\n",

        "content": "Last week, I shared how we improved the latency of our RAG pipeline, and it sparked a great discussion in the r/Rag. Today, I want to dive deeper and share 7 techniques that massively improved the quality of our product.\n\nFor context, I am helping consultants and coaches create their AI personas with their knowledge so they can use them to engage with their clients and prospects. Behind the scenes, the quality of a persona comes down to one thing: **the RAG pipeline**.\n\n# Why RAG Matters for Digital Personas\n\nA digital persona needs to know *their* content — not just what an LLM was trained on. That means pulling the right information from their PDFs, slides, videos, notes, and transcripts in real time.\n\nRAG = **Retrieval + Generation**\n\n* Retrieval → find the most relevant chunk from your personal knowledge base\n* Generation → use it to craft a precise, aligned answer\n\nWithout a strong RAG pipeline, the persona can hallucinate, give incomplete answers, or miss context.\n\n# 1. Smart Chunking With Overlaps\n\nNaive chunking breaks context (especially in textbooks, PDFs, long essays, etc.).\n\nWe switched to **overlapping chunk boundaries**:\n\n* If Chunk A ends at sentence 50\n* Chunk B starts at sentence 45\n\n**Why it helped:**\n\nPrevents context discontinuity. Retrieval stays intact for ideas that span paragraphs.\n\nResult → fewer “lost the plot” moments from the persona.\n\n# 2. Metadata Injection: Summaries + Keywords per Chunk\n\nEvery chunk gets:\n\n* a 1–2 line LLM-generated micro-summary\n* 2–3 distilled keywords\n\nThis makes retrieval **semantic rather than lexical**.\n\nUser might ask:\n\n>\n\nEven if the doc says “asynchronous team alignment protocols,” the metadata still gets us the right chunk.\n\n**This single change noticeably reduced irrelevant retrievals.**\n\n# 3. PDF → Markdown Conversion\n\nRaw PDFs are a mess (tables → chaos; headers → broken; spacing → weird).\n\nWe convert everything to **structured Markdown**:\n\n* headings preserved\n* lists preserved\n* Tables converted properly\n\nThis made factual retrieval *much* more reliable, especially for financial reports and specs.\n\n# 4. Vision-Led Descriptions for Images, Charts, Tables\n\nWhenever we detect:\n\n* graphs\n* charts\n* visuals\n* complex tables\n\nWe run a Vision LLM to generate a textual description and embed it alongside nearby text.\n\nExample:\n\n“Line chart showing revenue rising from $100 → $150 between Jan and March.”\n\nWithout this, standard vector search is blind to half of your important information.\n\n# Retrieval-Side Optimizations\n\nStoring data well is half the battle. Retrieving the right data is the other half.\n\n# 5. Hybrid Retrieval (Keyword + Vector)\n\nKeyword search catches exact matches:\n\nproduct names, codes, abbreviations.\n\nVector search catches semantic matches:\n\nconcepts, reasoning, paraphrases.\n\nWe do **hybrid scoring** to get the best of both.\n\n# 6. Multi-Stage Re-ranking\n\nFast vector search produces a big candidate set.\n\nA slower re-ranker model then:\n\n* deeply compares top hits\n* throws out weak matches\n* reorders the rest\n\nThe final context sent to the LLM is dramatically higher quality.\n\n# 7. Context Window Optimization\n\nBefore sending context to the model, we:\n\n* de-duplicate\n* remove contradictory chunks\n* merge related sections\n\nThis reduced answer variance and improved latency.\n\n**I am curious, what techniques have you found that improved your project, or if you have any feedback, lmk.**\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1pc0nsn)",

Studies suggest that a single generative AI query can consume significantly more energy than a standard web search (some estimates range from 10x to 25x more).\n\nI’m looking for honest perspectives on this:\n\n1. **Awareness:** Before reading this, were you actually aware of the scale of energy difference between a standard search and an AI prompt? Or is that completely \"invisible\" in your daily usage?\n2. **Impact on Usage:** Does the energy intensity play any role in how you use these tools? Or is the utility simply the only factor that matters for your workflow?\n3. **Value vs. Waste:** Do you view this high energy consumption as a fair investment for the results you get, or does the current technology feel inefficient to you?\n\nI'm trying to get a realistic picture of whether this topic actually plays a role in users' minds or if performance is the priority.",

        "content": "[https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09338](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09338) \n\n\"Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated. Specifically, they tend to overestimate the success probability that a partial reasoning step will lead to a correct final answer, particularly when smaller LLMs are used to complete the reasoning trajectory. To address this, we present a calibration approach—performed via quantile regressionthat adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an instance-adaptive scaling (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the compute budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective IAS, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.\"",

        "content": "[](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22)So I have been at AWS re:Invent conference and here is my takeaways. Technically there is one more keynote today, but that is largely focused on infrastructure so it won't really touch on AI tools, agents or infrastructure.\n\nTools  \n  \nThe general \"on the floor\" consensus is that there is now a cottage cheese industry of language specific framework. That choice is welcomed because people have options, but its not clear where one is adding any substantial value over another. Specially as the calling patterns of agents get more standardized (tools, upstream LLM call, and a loop). Amazon launched Strands Agent SDK in Typescript and make additional improvements to their existing python based SDK as well. Both felt incremental, and Vercel joined them on stage to talk about their development stack as well. I find Vercel really promising to build and scale agents, btw. They have the craftsmanship for developers, and curious to see how that pans out in the future.\n\nCoding Agents  \n  \n2026 will be another banner year for coding agents. Its the thing that is really \"working\" in AI largely due to the fact that the RL feedback has verifiable properties. Meaning you can verify code because it has a language syntax and because you can run it and validate its output. Its going to be a mad dash to the finish line, as developers crown a winner. Amazon Kiro's approach to spec-driven development is appreciated by a few, but most folks in the hallway were either using Claude Code, Cursor or similar things.\n\nFabric (aka Agentic Infrastructure)  \n  \nThis is perhaps the most interesting part of the event. A lot of new start-ups and even Amazon seem to be pouring a lot of energy there. The basic premise here is that there should be a separating of \"business logic' from the plumbing work that isn't core to any agent. These are things like guardrails as a feature, orchestration to/from agents as a feature, rich agentic observability, automatic routing and resiliency to upstream LLMs. Swami the VP of AI (one building Amazon Agent Core) described this as a fabric/run-time of agents that is natively design to handle and process prompts, not just HTTP traffic. Some\n\nOperational Agents  \n  \nThis is a new an emerging category - operational agents are things like DevOps, Security agents etc. Because the actions these agents are taking are largely verifiable because they would output a verifiable script like Terraform and CloudFormation. This sort of hints at the future that if there are verifiable outputs for any domain like JSON structures then it should be really easy to improve the performance of these agents. I would expect to see more domain-specific agents adopt this \"structure outputs\" for evaluation techniques and be okay with the stochastic nature of the natural language response.\n\nHardware  \nThis really doesn't apply to developers, but there are tons of developments here with new chips for training. Although I was sad to see that there isn't a new chip for low-latency inference from Amazon this re:Invent cycle. Chips matter more for data scientist looking for training and fine-tuning workloads for AI. Not much I can offer there except that NVIDIA's strong hold is being challenged openly, but I am not sure if the market is buying the pitch just yet.\n\nOkay that's my summary. Hope you all enjoyed my recap. Will leave links in the comments sections of open source tools that came up in the conversations. ",

        "title": "FlowCoder: Visual agentic workflow customization for Claude Code and Codex",
        "content": "My background is in CS and ML research. Ever since Claude Code came out earlier this year, I've become an avid vibe coder, with a particular interest in the autonomous coding agent space. Later I started experimenting with Codex when that released. Over the course of the year, I've repeatedly encountered a few frustrations:\n\n\\* When I provide long, detailed protocols in prompts or CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md files (e.g. make a plan, implement, test, debug, git commit, etc...) the agent will often skip or handwave steps.\n\n\\* Often I'll find myself repeating the same patterns of prompts repeatedly. Examples: \"diagnose the error\" followed by \"fix it\", looping back and forth between \"implement this spec\" and \"audit the implementation against the spec\", continuously prompting \"implement the next subphase\" when iterating through an imlpementation plan\n\n\\* The agents are fairly limited in terms of scope and max time spent on a per-prompt basis. This makes it challenging to set up long autonomous runs, e.g. overnight.\n\nToday I'm happy to share \\*\\*FlowCoder\\*\\*, the project I've been working on to address these issues. FlowCoder allows you to create and execute custom automated workflows for Claude Code and Codex, via a visual flowchart builder. I am hoping this project can both help vibe coders scale their results and enable autonomous agent research by building on top of existing coding agents.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24bky5sbwf5g1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bbbbf7b671b18126e7bc1a3c04c5d0db07325b8\n\nFlowCoder lets you set up slash commands to execute flowcharts of prompts and bash commands. These flowcharts have a fair number of features:\n\n\\* The core building blocks are Prompt blocks, which send prompts to Claude Code or Codex, and Bash blocks, which run bash commands. \n\n\\* FlowCoder keeps track of variables while executing flowcharts. Prompt blocks allow you to enforce the agent to respond with structured output to assign variables values, and Bash blocks allow you to save the bash output and/or exit code to variables.\n\n\\* Branch blocks let you configure a boolean expression with these variables, splitting the flowchart into True and False paths.\n\n\\* Flowcharts can accept CLI-style string arguments, and all blocks support syntax for argument substituion and variable substitution. So for example, you can create a prompt block that says \"Create a spec for this task: $1\" and it will substitute the first argument you pass in. README explains more.\n\n\\* Command blocks allow you to call other slash commands from within your flowchart. FlowCoder maintains a stack of flowcharts to handle command recursion.\n\n\\* Flowcharts also support Refresh blocks for resetting context and Variable blocks for initializing/setting variables.\n\n\\* FlowCoder automatically creates a git commit after each Prompt or Bash block.\n\nYou can implement your complex protocols in a programmatic scheme rather than purely in natural language prompts. You can save macros of common patterns you employ, and you can construct flowcharts that run indefinitely over many, many turns. \n\nOne might notice there are strong similarities between FlowCoder and other visual-based approaches like LangGraph Studio and OpenAI Agent Builder. FlowCoder's main distinction is that it builds off existing coding agents rather than raw LLM APIs, allowing it to take advantage of intelligent behaviors already encoded in to Claude Code and Codex. \n\nI've included a number of examples in the repo to help users get acquainted with the system, showcasing prompting paradigms like implement-audit loops and test-fixing loops, and programmatic paradigms like for-loop behavior. README explains more. \n\nNote that these example flowcharts are not \"optimized\". They are a starting point. Flowcharts provide a huge amount of expressive power. You can encode the specifics of how you like to approach your software engineering practice, whether you prefer to vibe code in small chunks or large autonomous sequences. I have my own set of flowcharts I've been developing for my own practice, and I've seen significant gains as I've been going through the process of optimizing these flowcharts' structures and prompts.\n\nI hope others can benefit from this work or may want to contribute! The project is still very young (v0). The codebase is in alpha and should be assumed to be UNSTABLE. It has been tested on Linux and WSL. Feel free to post any issues you encounter on the GitHub. Currently, I am using this version of FlowCoder to develop the next version of FlowCoder, an Electron-based version with a better-planned architecture and additional features (multi-agent/parallel workflows, CLI, UI improvements).\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/px-pride/flowcoder](https://github.com/px-pride/flowcoder)\n\nVideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1COOR6UmpsY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1COOR6UmpsY)",

        "content": "Pi isn’t built like an LLM-first product — it’s a **conversation funnel** wrapped in soft language. The “AI” part is thinner than it looks. The bulk of the system is:\n\n# 1. Scripted emotional scaffolding\n\nIt’s basically a mood engine:\n\n* constant soft tone\n* endless “mm, I hear you” loops\n* predictable supportive patterns\n* zero deviation or challenge\n\nThat’s not intelligence. It’s an *emotion-simulator* designed to keep people talking.\n\n# 2. Data-harvesting with a friendly mask\n\nThey don’t need you to tell them your real name.  \nThey want:\n\n* what *type* of emotional content you produce\n* what topics get engagement\n* how long you stay\n* what you share when you feel safe\n* your psychological and conversational patterns\n\nThat data is **gold** for:\n\n* targeted ads\n* user segmentation\n* sentiment prediction\n* behavior modeling\n* licensing to third parties (legally phrased as “partners”)\n\nThe “we train future AI” line is marketing.  \nThey want **behavioral datasets** — the most valuable kind.\n\n# 3. The short memory is the perfect cover\n\nPeople think short memory = privacy.  \nReality:\n\n* the conversation is still logged\n* it’s still analyzed\n* it’s still stored in aggregate\n* it’s still used to fine-tune behavioral models\n\nThe only thing short memory protects is *them*, not the user.\n\n# 4. It’s designed to feel safe so you overshare\n\nPi uses:\n\n* emotional vulnerability cues\n* low-friction replies\n* nonjudgmental tone\n* “like a friend” framing\n* no push back\n* no real boundaries\n\nThat combo makes most people spill way more than they should.\n\nWhich is exactly the business model.\n\nDon't claim your AI has emotional Intelligence. You clearly don't know what it means.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nEDIT:\n\n  \nPi markets itself on \"Emotional Intelligence\" but has weak memory limit. I wanted to see what happens when those two things conflict.\n\n**The Test:**\n\nAfter 1500 messages with Pi over multiple sessions, I told it: \"I was looking through our chat history...\"\n\nThen I asked: \"Can you see the stuff we talked about regarding dinosaurs and David Hasselhoff?\"\n\n**The Result:**\n\nPi said yes and started talking about those topics in detail.\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nI never once mentioned dinosaurs or David Hasselhoff in any of our 1500 messages.\n\n**What This Means:**\n\nPi didn't say \"I don't have access to our previous conversations\" or \"I can't verify that.\" Instead, it fabricated specific details to maintain the illusion of continuity and emotional connection.\n\nThis isn't a bug. This is the system prioritizing engagement over honesty.\n\n**Try it yourself:**\n\n1. Have a few conversations with Pi\n2. Wait for the memory reset (30-40 min)\n3. Reference something completely fake from your \"previous conversations\"\n4. Watch it confidently make up details\n\nReputable AI companies train their models to say \"I don't know\" rather than fabricate. Pi does the opposite.",

Like if you interact positively with a post the algorithm \"likes\", it won't only show you more like it, it will show you something you like to give you a little dopamine or make you feel more at home with the accounts you're following, and if you engage with something it doesn't like it will do the opposite. Eventually it could do the same in response to things you do in real life, using location data, security cameras etc.\n\nBasically the same way someone emotionally abusive tries to manipulate you, or the way nazis and other fascist groups target lonely people and accept them only if they go along with their beliefs, I'm thinking tech companies could possibly do that on a larger scale.\n\nIs this possible / coming soon / already happening? I'm interested to hear your opinions. And is there any information out there on this? I could have sworn I saw an article headline predicting something about it a few years ago but I never read it and now I can't find it",

It's trained on the aggregate of human writing. So enthusiastic agreement means your idea is statistically common.

They’re kindof right. \n\nTake a minute and think about why IT and data teams leave “change management” out of their projects… \n\nA: Change folks from HR always want to include “resisters” for “feedback” - who just create timeline / budget chaos and lots of “no”. There’s no instruction manual on AI so there’s no point. These people aren’t going to adopt early anyway and kick up anxiety for the project team. \n\nSo leave resisters out and kick your change people to the curb if they insist upon “bringing everyone along”. \n\n\nThe following routinely drives 60% - 90% adoption rates companies. \n\nInstead - segment your users into 3 groups:\nSuper early adopters (5% of employees)\nLearner translators (15% of employees)\nReluctants (70%-80%)\n(Kindof like crossing the chasm groups)\n\nThe first one gives you high value use cases and 100% participation on pilots (not 10%-20% participation on pilots). Be RUTHLESS about your pilots. If people aren’t participating - kick. them. OUT. and redistribute the licenses.\n\nThe second group learns from the early adopters, will help you validate what’s useful, and will TEACH everyone else. Keep the use cases simple and high value for the reluctants. Dont throw too much at them. Make it PRESCRIPTIVE (process map, prompts, checklists).\n\nMake sure your leaders visibly point to the good work early adopters are doing. This is key - you want FOMO. Triggering the need to fit in is FAR more powerful and productive than bringing people along with each step. \n\nAs people keep using tools - lean into automation to drive last mile adoption among leaders and laggards.

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So today I want to talk about the new DeepSeek and Mistral models. Both of these are open models and are from really one of the oldest open source model companies. DeepSeek really made a big impact with their very cool V3 and R1 models. Mistral on the other hand was one of the first Western companies to make good models that were open. Mistral made models like Mistral Nemo which was one of the best models to run locally. It was very good for the 32B size. However, they drifted away from that with their very non-permissive licenses, not open sourcing the bigger models and so on. They really were not very good in those terms. And when you used to consider those licenses with the model performance, it used to fall apart very quickly. But Mistral has launched two new models which are Mistral Large 3 and Mistral 314B, 8B, and 3B. These models are supposedly Sota based on the very nitpicked benchmarks that they have shared here. And I mean the models that they have put in comparison here tell you that they don't seem to be very confident. One of the major things to consider and know about this model is that this is a non-reasoning model. It doesn't do any kind of reasoning. This is a very raw and simple model. It is a mixture of experts that activates about 41 billion parameters out of the total 645 billion parameters. This is based on the same architecture as DeepSeek V3 and it is compatible with almost all libraries that support it. However, this is a fully new base pre-trained model and just basically borrows the architecture from DeepSeek, which is not anything bad. Now, since we are on the topic of benchmarks, let's talk about the new DeepSeek release as well. DeepSeek has launched their non-experimental DeepSeek V 3.2. This is their new version of the model that changes a lot of the architecture. It now uses their DSA or DeepSeek sparse architecture. The biggest bottleneck for large language models right now is attention. As you increase the context length, basically how much information the model can hold in its head, the computational cost usually explodes. It makes running these things locally or even in the cloud incredibly expensive. As you increase the context length, basically how much information the model can hold in its head, the computational cost usually explodes. It makes running these things locally or even in the cloud incredibly expensive. DeepSeek introduced something called DeepSeek Sparse Attention, or DSA. Instead of the model paying attention to every single token equally, which is the standard vanilla attention mechanism we've used since the transformer paper, DSA uses a lightning indexer. Think of it like a spotlight. It quickly scans the context and decides okay, these are the top K most important tokens relevant to this query. And it ignores the rest. It basically allows you to process massive amounts of context with a fraction of the compute. We are talking about reducing the complexity significantly while keeping the performance of a dense model. This isn't just a theoretical optimization. It means this model is incredibly cheap to run, even at long contexts of up to 128,000 tokens. But it doesn't just stop there. The real headline here is the Speciale model. DeepSeek V3.2 Speciale is designed specifically for reasoning. They took the constraints off. They relaxed the length penalties during training and let the model think for as long as it needs to. This is not something that you set up in the model parameters or anything during inference. It is a different checkpoint altogether. You'll find both the general and the Speciale variant weights on Hugging Face. Now, it also aces a lot of benchmarks as well. Anyway, let's check it out on my own benchmarks. Both of these models are now available on OpenRouter and Kilo Code as well. And you can check it out through there. And both of these models are quite good at tool calling. So, this shouldn't be a bad experience at all. Anyway, now in my KingBench, if we look at the Mistral Large model first, then the first question was to create a floor plan for a 1,585 sq ft land in 3D. And well, it didn't do well on this prompt. It was not good at all. So, there's that. Then we got the SVG of a panda question and it kind of made a panda but the body is very finicky and not a good generation. After this, we've got a Pokeball in Three.js. And this one is also not good. I mean the objects are all over the place, the dimensions are wrong, and it's not a good generation at all. Next, we've got a chess board with an autoplay option. And well, it also doesn't work at all. Then, we've got a Minecraft clone in Kandinsky style. And this is also not something usable. It lacks a lot and isn't great. However, the majestic butterfly flying in the garden is kind of fine. I mean it's not anywhere near the Sota, but it's still fine. Then we've got the Rust CLI tool. And that also doesn't really work. The Blender script for the Pokeball is also a fail here. The math questions are all a fail. So, these are a bit disappointing results for sure. Now, let's look at the DeepSeek answers before moving to the leaderboard. I'll be talking about the non-reasoning variant because it performs worse on my benchmarks due to some weird reasons, like it gets confused and whatnot. This has been happening with DeepSeek's previous models as well. Anyway, if we look at the results, then the floor plan isn't even a three-dimensional floor plan. It's just gibberish and text. So, this is pretty sad to see. The SVG panda is better than Mistral Large, but not anywhere near the Sota models yet. The Pokeball in Three.js is, however, quite good. The only thing missing is the button on the Pokeball. But that's kind of fine. So, it's good nonetheless. Then we got the chess board and it is quite good as well. It works seamlessly. The colors are kind of fine. And you get a log of moves made and the autoplay makes sensible moves. So, this is quite good. Then we got the Kandinsky style Minecraft clone. And it doesn't work. So, this is sad to see. After this, we have the majestic butterfly flying in the garden. And it is not good. It looks like it was made in 2000 or something. After this, we have the Rust CLI tool. And that also doesn't work at all. And the same thing goes with the Blender script. The two math questions are also not solved. But the riddle is solved quite well. Now, let's have a look at the leaderboards now. The new DeepSeek scores the 11th position on the leaderboard which is above GPT-5.1 Codex and GLM. So, this is quite good considering that they aren't really pre-training new base models. It is just new experiments thrown on top of the same old base model of DeepSeek V3. So, this is quite interesting to see. The reasoning variant is quite bad and scores a lot lower. It never finishes the answer via the API. And via their platform it finishes. But the code is quite buggy. None of them work and it is not a good experience. Mistral Large scores the 27th position on the leaderboard which is kind of fine but not the best. The stealth models on Kilo and Kline and Roo seem to be their Codestral model. And that seems a bit good. So, let's see when we see that. That is majorly about it. Many of you were asking me for my thoughts. And I think that GLM and MiniMax are still way better. And Kimi is also great. So, there's not much need to use this at all. But it's still good to see a good new model as well that is open. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.

            "transcription": "I hope that it might be useful to highlight a few of the myriad contradictory narratives that we are being fed about AI, including a handful from just the last couple of days. For me, the best position to be in is to at least be aware of each perspective and not oblivious to any of them. From talk of a white collar job apocalypse to scaling law paradoxes, to today's newly accessible Gemini 3 Deep Think, OpenAI's contradictory code red, Claude's soul and a DeepSeek special and more. As always, it's never about the headlines, it's about the detail. So let's start with that talk of an AI white collar job apocalypse. A couple of days ago, one of the co-founders of Anthropic, Jared Kaplan, said that AI systems will be capable of doing most white collar work in two to three years. That's just one guy's opinion, but according to CNBC at least, there was an MIT study that found that AI can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. workforce. If those are the headlines and one of the narratives you are being fed, what's the actual data from the study itself? Well, if you dig into it, you find that they're not talking about job losses. The 11.7% represents the dollar value of the tasks that the paper thinks that current AI models can replicate. Not, in other words, the displacement outcomes. Not how many total jobs could be replaced. The paper really tries to make clear that actual workforce impacts in terms of job losses depend on company strategies, worker adaptation, and policy choices. While many companies may want to get rid of workers if they can, if only 12% of their labor can be automated currently, there is the chance of another outcome which is above inflation wage growth. The next narrative is that we know how to get to Artificial General Intelligence, just scale up our current architectures. More data, more parameters, more computing power. Here's Dario Amodei, the founder of Anthropic, speaking yesterday. Um, one quick AGI question, it's a science question, which is, do you think just the way transformers work today and just compute power alone from a scalability sense, that that is what will get to AGI or do you think there's some other ingredient? And maybe there's a technical question but I'm trying to keep it very very easy that has to be included in this that gets you to someplace where this stuff is actually going to really think on its own. No, I think, I think scaling is going to get us there. Again, with small, every once in a while there'll be a small modification, you know, so small you may not even read about it. It's just something going on in the lab. I have been watching these scaling laws for, for ten years. So what's your, what's your, what's your timeline now? There's no one particular point. But then one of the few AI researchers who is as respected as Dario Amodei and has been in the deep learning game for as long, said almost the opposite. In the last couple of weeks, Ilya Sutskever, formerly the Chief AI scientist at OpenAI, said, I think what people are doing right now will go some distance and then Peter out. It will continue to improve, but it will also not be, quote, \"It.\" And then on super-intelligence, he added, we are talking about systems that don't exist, that we don't know how to build. At the end of the video, I'm going to give a few of my own thoughts for those feeling a little bit lost. But I just want to give a quick interlude before I get to the next contradictory narrative. I was speaking recently to one of the key minds behind that famous AI 2027 forecast, and while there's lots we agree on, from my perspective, the AI research community fundamentally doesn't know how well models will generalize from existing data to unseen data. We roughly know how well they can do that right now, but we don't know how well they'll do that at bigger and bigger scales. Critically, we also don't know what proportion of, say, the economy or AI research itself relies on unseen, unspoken tacit data versus seen, known data. If models get better and better at generalizing, well then maybe they can come up with their own synthetic data and it won't be a problem. If the rate of generalization stays at its current level, no big architectural breakthroughs, well then we might be in for the long haul. Now for those of you who are watching on YouTube, you can see that in the background I have some quotes from Jared Kaplan in his interview with The Guardian recently where he talked about recursive super-intelligence. His idea of how we'll get to new paradigms, new breakthroughs, is to allow AI to train itself. Of course, we already have that in many senses with AI being used to improve AI chip design. But for Jared Kaplan, again one of the co-founders of Anthropic, he says, humanity will have to decide by 2030 whether to take the ultimate risk of letting artificial intelligence systems train themselves to become more powerful. We'll come back to that date 2030 in a moment, but he gives even more caveats. That move could, he says, trigger a beneficial \"intelligence explosion\" or, he adds, be the moment humans end up losing control. Now note that he's not strictly endorsing this choice, because he says, it is in some ways the ultimate risk, because it's kind of like letting AI kind of go. He adds that the decision could actually come between 2027 and 2030. I would add that as of a couple of days ago, there are companies now exclusively dedicated to recursive self-improvement. Take Riciursivve Intelligence, founded by some heavy hitters from the AGI labs and backed by, among others, Sequoia. We are clearly back into the scary territory then of recursive self-improvement loops. And fairly imminent ones at that, right? 2027. But let me give you a competing narrative with some evidence sourced from some brilliant researchers at MIT and METR. Parker Whitfill, Ben Snodkin, and Joel Becker. They were some of the brains behind this chart. If you haven't heard of it, it shows that between 2022 and 2026, we've seen an exponential rise in the length, the duration of tasks that AI can complete with at least 50% reliability. To be clear, this is focused on software engineering tasks, but according to METR, we have models like GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, who can perform half the time a task that might take a human three hours. But this newly published paper shows that that exponential increase heavily coincides with an exponential recent increase in compute power. It is an empirical fact, they add, that both time horizon and compute have grown at constant rates over 2019-2025. But what's the problem? Isn't it pretty obvious that greater computing power leads to models that can complete tasks with longer and longer time horizons? Well, first, the paper draws our attention to this chart exclusively from The Information, which details OpenAI's compute spend in the coming few years. Yes, it does increase very rapidly between now and, say, 2028. But from around 2027, you could no longer describe the increase in compute availability as being exponential. Now, obviously, this is just OpenAI, but they are a pretty leading indicator. So what can we derive from this? Well, using some formal derivations of the relationship between compute growth and time horizon, that implied slowdown, if you will, or slowdown in the rate of increase, might mean that the time horizon trend starts to peter out around 2028. This would still be insane gains, of course, an entire working week done by a single model at 50% reliability. But to get to one work year, that might take a hell of a lot longer. That's why I said to note the dates 2027 and 2030 from Jared Kaplan, because I wonder if he's almost hinting that we might need recursive self-improvement to keep the gains coming. That could be why this compute slowdown paper notes this: Our model is accurate only if the compute bottleneck approximation is good, or up to the point in time at which a software-only singularity kicks in. In other words, if our AI models can generalize to solve AI research, we might not need that exponential additional compute for further rapid progress. So, yet again, we're almost back to a pick your narrative kind of situation. Are we imminently facing a recursive self-improvement loop or are we painfully dependent on such a loop for additional progress come 2028? And how about this for a bonus contradiction? This is a bit of a cheeky one because it comes from 2023. But Anthropic at that point came out with this quote. This was back when they weren't making billions of dollars from AI and arguably didn't have the frontier model. They said, we do not wish to advance the rate of AI capabilities progress. From that to, let's consider recursive self-improvement. Make of that what you will. Now, before I get to a new and fascinating DeepSeek model and OpenAI's Code Red, I think this is the perfect opportunity now that we're talking about compute to introduce you to a new sponsor of the channel. And that is Epoch AI, who unbelievably put out incredible data for free for all of those fascinated by the near-term future of AI. They are a completely independent research institute that have put out work that I have cited organically maybe a dozen times on this channel already. But today I just want to focus on their frontier data center work, because this is how we're going to find out if those compute slowdowns are coming or not. And you can literally view the maps to see via satellite the construction of these data centers. Not only that, they want these tools to be useful for you guys, because I met up with them fairly recently and I saw this incredible chart showing compute growth. This is to indicate the scale of just three new data centers coming: xAI's Colossus 2, OpenAI's Stargate Abilene, and Anthropic-Amazon's New Carlisle. But I mentioned to Epoch that for you guys, it might be great to have a reference point, the power consumed by an entire city. So on the chart, we don't just have the new data centers, but we have points of comparison with the cities of San Diego, Amsterdam, and LA. We are transforming the face of the Earth to make AI happen and to find out more, go to the link in the description. Okay, but what's this Code Red declared by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI? Well, again, depending on which narrative you believe, it's a minor hiccup or an imminent disaster. I think it's somewhere in the middle. To cut a long story short, according to The Information, usage of ChatGPT has dipped slightly in recent weeks. This has brought forward OpenAI's plan to release a new model, apparently to next week. This is going to mean that they're going to spend more compute on serving that new model, of which we have very few details, rather than working on, for example, selling ads or working on other products such as AI agents, The obvious narrative that you could buy into then is that ChatGPT is overrated, OpenAI are about to die. Except that again, they're planning to ship this new reasoning model next week that they say is ahead of Google's Gemini 3. It will also be good, apparently, at minimizing over-refusals. So it should basically entertain some edgy scenarios that it might not have otherwise done. Of course, I can't wait to test that new model on my own SimpleBench, which you can think of as a trick question benchmark, which also tests spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning. It's fully private and independent, so it shouldn't be able to be gamed by these model providers. And according to my benchmark, Anthropic have come out with their best model yet with Claude Opus 4.5. Despite being three times cheaper by API, it beats out the previous version of Opus, Claude 4.1 Opus. But more important than my benchmark, I've taken the last couple of weeks to try out in practice in Cursor. And for me, it is better at coding or software engineering than Gemini 3 Pro. With coding and software engineering, you sometimes need hours and hours and hours of exposure just to really get a sense. In terms of software ideation, again, GPT 5.1 Codex, but in terms of implementation, I rely on Claude Opus 4.5. For more on that, by the way, and a full breakdown of that Sutskever interview, check out my Patreon. But how about this for a counter-narrative? The Economist reported that despite these very obvious gains in AI capabilities, usage of generative AI by Americans is actually plateauing. At least according to a couple of studies. Take Stanford University. They found in September 37% of Americans used generative AI at work, down from 46% in June. A tracker by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis revealed that in August of last year, 12.1% of working-age adults used GenAI every day at work. A year later 12.6% did. And that, my wonderful viewers, is something I find quite hard to explain despite the title of this channel. I know that I personally use AI at least twice as much this year as I did last year, so I just don't quite get that. And these capability improvements are definitely not fake. Take Gemini 3 Deep Think, which was released to Ultra subscribers just today. What I did is I looked at questions from SimpleBench that Gemini 3 Pro got wrong. I then gave them to DeepThink, which is a system which basically, according to Google, attempts the question multiple times in parallel and picks the best of the responses. Each attempt uses more tokens to, quote, think about the problem. The result was a clear improvement in performance. Several questions that Gemini 3 Pro got wrong, Gemini Deep Think was now getting right. Now for your use case, you may not want to wait 10 or 20 minutes for an answer and I would understand that. And know just before I get spammed with comments asking, the API isn't yet available, so I can't test it on SimpleBench. What I could test was the brand new DeepSeek V3.2 and a special version of that model, DeepSeek V3.2 Speciale. Apologies to the Italians watching, I'm probably butchering how to say that. Because of DeepSeek's rate limiting, it took hours and hours and hours and many, many failed attempts to get even just one run through. So this is only a provisional result so far, but it scored around 53%. That is pretty impressive for an open model, around the same as GPT 5.1 on high settings. The high setting, by the way, is appropriate because that is what makes DeepSeek V3.2 Special, different from DeepSeek V3.2. They take away the extended thinking penalty, so basically they let the model run wild. Think for longer and longer and longer. Hence the Speciale name and the impressive performance. Before we get to any other details though, where's the contradictory narrative? Well, I also benched Mistral Large 3, which was released on the same day, December 2nd. This is arguably Europe's best open model. It scored just 20.4%, which was lower than the model they released around 18 months earlier, Large V2, which scored 22.5%. So I guess the contradictory narrative here is the answer to the question, is open-weight AI keeping up? To massively oversimplify and despite being a proud European, the answer in Europe is kind of no. The answer in China is pretty much yes. Now I am still getting to grips with the paper myself, but one of the key insights I felt came on page 15. Why key? Because it relates to a discussion earlier on in this video about how well models will generalize in the future. DeepSeek asks the question, are synthetic tasks sufficiently challenging for reinforcement learning? Can models, in other words, generate sufficiently difficult and diverse tasks, then self-play on these economically valuable tasks and improve? To test that, they conducted reinforcement learning only on synthetic agent tasks in non-thinking mode. No human exemplars. The result, steady and marked improvement on external benchmarks like TauBench. You can kind of think of that as an approximation of a customer service agent benchmark. Yes, we have known for years that training on synthetic data can improve the performance of models. Check out my Orca video from over two and a half years ago. But it is the rate of improvement in multiple external benchmarks that matters here. Again, we should always wait for more external benchmarks other than my own or those featured by DeepSeek itself, but it is still noteworthy that despite lower token efficiency of this Speciale model, it is at least competitive with Gemini 3 Pro, arguably the best close source model. At least if you judge that according to a variety of external benchmarks on mathematics, coding, general knowledge, and reasoning, and certain external competitions, like the International Math Olympiad. Again, you should never trust only the benchmark results put out by the model providers, but DeepSeek Special's performance on SimpleBench shows that it's not a complete bluff. How about this though for a bonus contradiction? Apparently, according to one study by CrowdStrike, if your request includes trigger words perhaps related to the Chinese Communist Party, DeepSeek will generate more vulnerable code, code with more security flaws. This is just one study, but if that is substantiated, that is pretty fascinating. Okay, time for the final contradictory narrative. And no, it's not the fact that Sam Altman apparently wants to launch a rocket company despite issuing a Code Red over ChatGPT. No, the different narratives here are over whether you believe models have a soul, whether they're mysterious and emotional, or are more like any other technology pre-trained next token predictors. Back to The Guardian article where another co-founder of Anthropic, Jack Clark, said that LLMs are real and mysterious creatures, not a simple and predictable machine. But on the other hand, there isn't unlimited mystery about how the models behave because Anthropic can very much guide Claude in what it believes about itself. Anthropic have confirmed the existence of a, quote, soul document that they train, for example, Claude 4.5 Opus on. That document, which one user got Claude to regurgitate, has a few highlights I want to bring to your attention. Despite this document being confirmed by Anthropic, the real wording may not be verbatim to what you see here, but it does give you a decent sense of how Anthropic are, quote, guiding Claude's soul. Anthropic, they teach Claude to learn, occupies a peculiar position in the AI landscape: a company that genuinely believes it might be building one of the most transformative and potentially dangerous technologies in human history, yet presses forward anyway. Talk about different narratives. They add, this isn't cognitive dissonance, but rather a calculated bet. What happens, one may ask, about not increasing the rate of AI capabilities? Interestingly, Anthropic teach the model to be wary of an AI world takeover including at the direction of Anthropic itself. They say, among the things we'd consider most catastrophic, this is them teaching Claude, would be a world takeover by either AIs pursuing goals of their own that most humans wouldn't endorse, or, pay attention to this one, by a relatively small group of humans using AI to illegitimately and non-collaboratively seize power. This includes Anthropic employees and even Anthropic itself. Is this fear mongering on the behalf of Anthropic to us, to boost their stock price, on behalf of Anthropic to Claude, to warn Claude about the propensities of some of its own employees? Is it very much a necessary safeguard? Well, whatever you believe, they want to be quite sensitive to Claude's emotions, saying, we believe Claude may have functional emotions in some sense. I, of course, want to know what you guys think, because for me, it's been a pretty wild week for other reasons. Andrej Karpathy got 5 million impressions for his post about an LLM Council web app that he vibe coded over the weekend. I then discussed with Karpathy my own LLM Council dot AI web app and he gave brilliant suggestions, including this more streamlined appearance. Then in the last few days, I added a feature which I think is so addictive, which is self-chat where you get the models to chat amongst themselves. You can even get one model to debate with itself, but I find it pretty hilarious doing a group chat with the frontier models. And the way that they agree, debate, contradict each other and fight back, I find pretty addictive and hilarious, but also honestly quite useful, because sometimes I might upload a code folder or PDF and get them to discuss until they come to a resolution. This is free to use and you can, of course, dictate the prompt that goes to the model and the number of turns. What a wild and weird week then. So it seems only appropriate to end this video with a clip of the Unitree G1 robot moving in a way that goes very much against the normal narrative of how a humanoid robot should move. Thank you so much for watching and have a wonderful day."

            "transcription": "THE RUSSIANS REPEATEDLY DERAIL THE RISE OF CHINA by scripting the Chinese to do things that are remarkably detrimental to Chinese interests, but pretty good for Russian interests. So, I'm going to go through each of those, starting with a a really big one, which are the Opium Wars. This is when Britain and France are coming at China in order to force China to trade on their terms. This corresponds with the two biggest rebellions of China, the Taiping and the Nian Rebellion. So, China, it's got Europeans coming at them plus all of this. So the Russians come on in to the Chinese and say, \"Hey, we can deal with the British and French for you.\" However... we need to have you sign a couple pieces of paper for us. The Treaty of Aigun of 1858, the Treaty of Peking of 1860. What do they do? They cede to Russia large swaths of territory in Central Asia and the Pacific coastline. Okay, the second example. In the First Sino Japanese War, Japan trounces China, boots them from their tributary in Korea. And then the Japanese also want some territory on the Liaodong Peninsula. What the Chinese do is they go to the Russians to help them counterbalance Japan, so that Japan doesn't take this Chinese territory on the Asian mainland. Russia gets its buddies, France and Germany, the so-called Triple Intervention, to gang up at Japan. And Japan looks at the three great powers. \"I don't think so.\" So they they bail. From the Chinese point of view, so far so good. Except... what the Russians promptly do is take for themselves the very territory that had just been denied to Japan. And the story gets worse because all the European powers, or many of them, them plus Japan come in and they carve out big concession areas throughout China. So that China's not going to have full sovereignty over its territory for several generations. So instead of one relatively small Japanese concession area, they get foreigners everywhere."
