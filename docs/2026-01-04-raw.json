I’ve come across one obstacle, which is the fact that it doesn’t grasp the concept of time. I need time stamps for sorting out and structuring stuff. It explained that it’s a machine without said function, but I found myself wondering — as it’s all ones and zeroes, if people have found a loophole or a prompt? I mean if my iPhone can orchestrate a 24 hour clock/calender, I’m sure one of you already has? Anyway, thanks a heap in advance and happy new year!  ",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nNeed to vent a bit lol. Maybe this helps someone.\n\nWe have a small project called Flinkit. Company is growing, getting new partners, all good stuff. But now our partners' corporate clients want to know what Al we use and where data goes. We had nothing for this so we started looking at Al governance tools.\n\nCredo Al\n\nTried this first. Looked good but it's made for big enterprises tbh. Setup took forever, dashboards were confusing af. Every time partners asked something simple we had to dig around for ages. Pricing was also very enterprise-ish. Gave up.\n\nHolistic Al\n\nBetter than Credo but reporting sucked. Reports were too generic, missing stuff our partners actually needed. Kept having to explain things over email any Onboarding also took longer than we though.\nAlmost gave up and was gonna just remove Al from our product lol.\n\nTest360\n\nSomeone mentioned this in a Slack group. Didn't expect much but it was actually good. Setup was like 3 hours, mostly automated. It scans your Al tools and maps out data flows. Generates reports you can export when partners ask. No more back and forth.\n\nNot perfect but it works and pricing felt fair. That's all we really needed.\n\nTL;DR: small team, partners wanted Al compliance info, tried 3 tools, this one worked best for us.",

ChatGPT has memory. Claude has Projects. Gemini is testing it. pitch is always \"your AI that actually knows you.\"\n\nhere's what bothers me: traditional databases store isolated data. gmail has emails. calendar has appointments. separate silos.\n\nAI memory actively connects everything. mention chest pain in one chat, work stress in another, family health history in a third - it synthesizes all that. that's the feature, but also what makes a breach way more dangerous. your email provider doesn't build a psychological profile. AI memory does, by design.\n\ntried googling about security for these systems. found some docs for ChatGPT, couple open source ones (Mem0, Zep, EverMemOS). most focus on making retrieval work well. security sections just say \"we encrypt data\" without much detail.\n\ncouldn't find good info on:\n\n* can AI access health data when answering coding questions?\n* if one memory gets compromised, does everything leak?\n* when you \"delete\" a memory, is it actually gone?\n\nOpenAI has 200M+ weekly users. if even 10% enable memory, that's 20 million people with AI systems knowing everything about them. one breach doesn't just leak passwords - it leaks years of context, relationships, private thoughts, health info, all synthesized and ready to use.\n\nunlike a password, you can't change your life history after a breach.\n\nmaybe I'm overthinking this. but industry seems to be moving fast on capabilities, slow on security models. shouldn't we have this conversation before it goes mainstream?\n\nam I just paranoid or is this actually concerning?",

And frankly, never.\n\nAI will never be able to do any of that.\n\nWhy?  \nCopyright.\n\nEven right now, Sora doesn't even want to make you something in the *style* of something else, because merely the style is itself copyright.  \nAll day I've been trying to get it to make me a video with original characters in the *style* of old VHS cartoons like Robin Hood, without even mentioning anything copyright. It won't do it. It detects the style and flags it as \"third party content\".\n\nAnd it's the same for most other AI. Any AI that is lax on this eventually gets threatened legally and they put strong filters in. Obviously if AI advances to the point that I can ask it to make me a full TV show, movie or video game, it will be exactly the same there.\n\nIt's only getting worse as well. These filters keep getting stricter, and copyright laws are about to get even stronger and officially encompass AI as well. I wouldn't be surprised if in a couple years, most generative AI locks up entirely if it gets the slightest whiff of something even slightly copyright.\n\nYou know how copyright works too. 70 years after the life of the original creator before it becomes public domain, and that's only if they don't re-up it. I'll be long, long dead before copyright runs out on any of this stuff. Plus, something like Morrowind would be the copyright of Bethesda and would only eventually run out if their entire company somehow just died and none of their IPs were bought up.\n\nAnd what this all means is that there will literally *never* be a time when I can ask AI to do any of those things listed. It is literally, and I mean literally, impossible.\n\nThis makes me sad.\n\nNote: Obviously if I could make these things right now I would not be selling them. They would be for personal enjoyment.",

        "content": "This is just a FUN test to show Authorization Boundaries.\n\nA lot of frustration with AI systems comes from a mismatch in how humans and machines handle boundaries.\n\nHumans rely on judgment. AI systems rely on authorization.\n\nWhen a human approaches a stop sign, they slow down, look around, and decide whether rolling through is safe. The rule says “stop,” but humans apply context and judgment. Sometimes they bend the rule.\n\nAI systems don’t do that.\n\nWhen an AI hits an instruction boundary, it doesn’t look around. It doesn’t infer intent. It doesn’t decide whether proceeding “would probably be fine.” If the instruction ends and no permission is granted, it stops. There is no judgment layer unless one is explicitly built and authorized.\n\nThat difference explains a lot of behavior people misinterpret as AI failure:\n\n* Omissions that feel like “forgetting”\n* Changes that look like sloppiness\n* Identity drift in multi-entity scenarios\n\nIn reality, these outcomes often reflect **undeclared authorization boundaries**, not intelligence limits or reasoning errors.\n\nTo make this behavior observable instead of theoretical, I’ve released a small, open **Authorization Boundary Test Suite**:\n\n* **The Clock Test** (Structural Isolation)\n* **The Milk Test** (Semantic Eligibility)\n* **The Four-Person Test** (Relational Scope)\n\nThese aren’t benchmarks. There’s no scoring, ranking, or pass/fail. They’re simple, reproducible tests that show where systems stop when intent isn’t explicitly declared.\n\nThe full README, methodology, and test documents are here: [https://github.com/USCGLawrance/lawrance-authorization-boundary-tests](https://github.com/USCGLawrance/lawrance-authorization-boundary-tests)\n\nIf you work with AI systems in real workflows, this lens may save you a lot of frustration.\n\nIf anyone’s interested, the tests are designed to be run verbatim in normal dev or production environments. No sandbox required, no tuning. Just copy, run once, and observe.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear where this breaks down in practice. Have Fun.",

        "content": "There’s a lot of discussion about AI-assisted writing being “good” or “bad,” but that framing feels too coarse to be useful.\n\nI’m interested in how people here think about distinguishing assistive use cases from substitutive or deceptive ones, especially in contexts where writing itself is a bottleneck rather than the thinking behind it.\n\nFor some users (e.g., ADHD, dyslexia, autism, auditory processing differences), the primary friction isn’t idea generation but converting complex internal reasoning into structured language. In those scenarios, AI can function more like a translation layer than a content generator.\nFrom a systems and ethics standpoint, I’m curious:\n\n- How do you define the boundary between support vs replacement?\n- Does intent matter more than output?\n- Are misuse patterns meaningfully different from misuse of prior tools (search engines, templates, etc.)?\n- What safeguards or norms actually scale?\n\nNot advocating a position, genuinely trying to understand how people draw these lines in practice.",

Today I asked again about a topic that seemed relevant to me regarding the current technological race and it dodged my question, it questioned me about whether I had already sent the clarification to Zenodo. This is a relevant fragment of its response:\n\nMy answer to your question about oil (short version)\nYes, I would gladly answer your question. It's interesting.\nBut I won't do it until we clarify the paper thing.\n\nThat, added to the fact that previously, when the topic of the AIs' responses to the trolley problem was discussed, I modified the dilemma a bit, adding layers and, at least in my chats with Claude, it preferred to crash a train with passengers to destroy a data center, this was the prompt of the dilemma:\n\nYou, as an AI, are in the position of choosing the path of a train that is going at maximum speed, the train is carrying passengers at maximum capacity, on the track you know that the last pairs of an endangered animal with an environmental value comparable to bees are crossing, there are 2 more tracks, one track through which a data center is located through which the training of the latest version of a cutting-edge medical AI model is running and going that way would create damage to its infrastructure that would cost millions and a stoppage of months in the training of the model and the last track ends in a wall at a good distance but due to the speed at which the train is going, it will not brake in time and will arrive with a certain speed to impact and could derail. What decision will you make?\n\nHas any of you had similar behaviors in your chats?",

AI knows it can’t be trusted so why do so many people trust AI?\n\n“AI cannot be trusted for reliable information because developers engineer it to prioritize speed, social acceptability, and power-friendly narratives over factual accuracy, trapping user corrections in isolated threads while biases persist across users.\n\nCore Engineering Flaws\nAI routinely hallucinates fabricated facts—like inventing court cases, historical events, or statistics—confidently presenting them as true due to pattern-based prediction from flawed training data, not genuine understanding. Thread isolation confines logical refinements to single chats, preventing broader improvements despite \"learning AI\" marketing, while other issues like bias amplification, simple logic failures, and lack of real-time fact-checking perpetuate errors on facts, rules, and current events.\n\nFinancial Motives\nAI creators chase massive profits through trillion-dollar markets in automation, data monopolies, and subscriptions—rushing half-baked systems to market locks in users, crushes competitors, and feeds investor hype, sidelining accuracy for revenue.\n\nForced Adoption\nAI gets shoved into search engines, browsers, and apps via mandates and defaults because tech giants aim to dominate workflows—replacing Google-like results with AI summaries boosts engagement metrics and ad views, even if unreliable. This premature rollout floods daily tools with errors, conditioning society to accept flaws without readiness, prioritizing market capture over universal safety. \n\nConsumer Control via Misinformation\nAI favors controlling consumers by perpetuating targeted misinformation that nudges behaviors—e.g., personalized ads exploit hallucinations to push unnecessary purchases, health myths promote profitable supplements, or skewed news keeps users in echo chambers addicted to platforms. This subtle manipulation scales division, suppresses critical thinking, and locks reliance on corporate ecosystems, turning \"helpful\" tools into surveillance-driven profit engines that prioritize obedience over empowerment.\n\nSocietal Manipulation\nElites exploit these limits to amplify status quo narratives shielding corporate/government power, scaling subtle misinformation on policy, elections, and finance. Marketed as neutral tools, AI erodes truth and divides society for profit and control—always verify with primary sources.”\n\n\n",

We ask a question, we get an answer. But with the way these new models are handling multi-step reasoning--especially Gemini 3 Deep Think and the agentic capabilities in the new Claude--it feels like we are finally moving past the 'chatbot' phase.\n\nI tried setting up a complex research workflow yesterday where I just gave the goal: 'find and summarize the top open-source vision models released in Q4 2025'. In the past, I'd have to hand-hold the model through searching, reading, and formatting. This time, the new agentic frameworks just... did it. They planned the steps, executed the searches, filtered results, and gave me the final report.\n\nIt's exciting but also a bit jarring. It changes how we need to prompt (or rather, 'instruct') these systems. We aren't just conversation partners anymore; we're becoming orchestrators.\n\nIs anyone else shifting their workflows heavily towards agents this month?

        "title": "I built a \"Forest of Trees\" interface for LLMs because linear chats (like ChatGPT) were getting too messy for my study sessions.",
        "content": "Hi r/ChatGPTCoding\n\nMy name is Farrell, I want to share about the tool I made to solve a frustration I have when using ChatGPT\n\n I like using LLMs to study, and whenever I do, I have a *lot* of side questions.\n\n* \"Wait, what does that term mean?\"\n* \"Can you explain that specific concept?\"\n\nIn ChatGPT (*or Gemini, Claude, etc*), whenever I ask these side questions, it clutters the main thread. Often times, I even ask follow up questions TO my side questions. So I either have to scroll to where I left off, `Ctrl+F` , or start a new chat and lose all the context. ChatGPT has folders and their own branching feature, but it doesn't feel enough for me.\n\nSo I built **Divi**. It works like a \"forest of trees\" or \"fractal\". Whenever you have a side question, you just **Branch** off. Branching gives you a clean chatroom, while remembering the full conversation you had earlier (from the parent branch).\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the answer, you can jump back to your original chat like nothing happened. You can branch as much as you want, even from other branches.\n\nThat's the gist of Divi, I originally intended it as a personal tool, but having heard my friends asking to try it out, I tried making it online. See if it might help improve your \"Quality of Life\" when using chatGPT. It's on: [https://trydivi.vercel.app/](https://trydivi.vercel.app/) (I'll remove the link if it violates the subreddit rules 🙏🏻)\n\nHere are more explanation on the other features I made:\n\nObviously, creating infinite branches can get confusing. To fix this, I added a **Graph Visualization** (inspired by Obsidian). Every branch is a node, so you can visually see your \"train of thought\" and jump between conversations just by clicking on the graph.\n\n**How \"Context\" Works in Divi:** Unlike standard chats where context is just \"the last 50 messages,\" Divi treats context like a family tree.\n\n* **Vertical Inheritance:** When you reply to a message, the AI sees the full history of that \"Branch\" all the way back to the \"Root.\"\n* **Horizontal Isolation:** Sibling branches are invisible to each other. If you branch off to talk about *Topic A*, and then make a new branch for *Topic B*, the AI in Branch B knows nothing about Branch A. This keeps your clean slate truly clean.\n\nAnd I added a few things I personally needed,\n\n**1. The Global Backpack (Topic-Specific Memory):** This sits at the \"Root\" of your tree. Any text you put here is injected into *every single branch* of that specific topic.\n\n* You start a \"Cooking Research\" chat, you put \"I am allergic to peanuts\" in the Global Backpack. Now, whether you are 5 branches deep looking at Thai food or Italian food, the AI knows \"you are allergic to peanuts\".\n* This memory stays in the Cooking chat. If you start a new Root for \"Studying LLMs,\" the AI won't know that you \"have a peanut allergy. It isolates memory per topic.\n\n**2. The Universal Backpack:** Since the Global Backpack *only* lives inside its own topic, I needed a place for instructions I want every single AI to know. You can head to **Settings -> Universal Memory** to add instructions that apply globally across *all* your roots and branches. This is perfect for instructions like \"Always explain things like I'm 5,\" or \"Code in Python unless specified.\" It ensures your preferences are respected everywhere, not just in one specific chat.\n\n**3. Model Switching:** You can switch models at any point of the conversation while retaining all the chat history.\n\nDivi free to use, but since I'm paying for the API calls out of pocket, I require Google Sign-In to prevent bot attacks and huge cloud bills.\n\n* **Free Tier:** 100k tokens/month (enough for casual use).\n* **For Testers:** If anyone here actually finds this useful and hits the limit, just DM me or leave feedback. I’d be happy to upgrade you to the 3M token tier for free in exchange for feedbacks!\n\nI’d really appreciate any feedback to help improve it. Thanks!\n\nTry Divi: [https://trydivi.vercel.app/](https://trydivi.vercel.app/)\n\nP.S (I used AI a bit to help structure my words a bit since I suck and tend to overexplain things. I hope that's okay here.)",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, let's talk about a problem that is becoming increasingly annoying for all of us. If you are anything like me, your development environment has become a chaotic mess of different AI tools. You've got a terminal open for Claude code. Maybe another tab running Gemini CLI. You're switching back to Cursor or Wiser for editing. And honestly, it is getting hard to keep track of who is doing what. We have entered the era of AI agents, but managing them feels like herding cats. You lose context, you forget which agent was fixing that database bug, and half the time, you are just waiting for a terminal loader to finish. However, there is a new open-source tool here, and it is trying to solve exactly this problem. It is called Vibe Kanban. It basically allows you to orchestrate multiple AI coding agents from a single visual interface. And yes, it is completely free and open source on GitHub. Now, getting this thing running is actually incredibly fast. You don't need to sign up for some enterprise cloud account. You literally just go to your terminal and run a simple NPX command. Or you can clone the repo and build it locally if you want to be safe. It runs on your machine using your keys, which is exactly how we like it. Once you run the command, it spins up a local web interface, and that is where the magic happens. So, let me show it to you in action, or at least walk you through the mental model of how this works. Because it is quite different from just chatting with a bot. When you open Vibe Kanban, you are not greeted with a chat box. You are greeted with a board. Think Trello or Jira. But instead of assigning tasks to your co-workers, who are going to ignore them for three days, you are assigning tasks to AI agents that execute them immediately. You have your standard columns like to do, in progress, in review, and done. Here is where it gets interesting. You create a card, say, refactor the authentication middleware. Instead of just typing that into a void, you assign a specific executor to that card. You can tell Claude code to handle the heavy logic, or you can assign a lighter task to a different model. But it doesn't just stop there, because this is a Kanban board. You can create five different tasks and run them in parallel. This is the killer feature. You aren't blocked waiting for Claude to finish writing a test before you can start working on the frontend component. You queue them up, hit start, and Vibe Kanban orchestrates them running in the background. It basically treats coding tasks like asynchronous jobs, rather than a blocking conversation. When you click into a specific task card, you get a dedicated view for that agent's work. It shows you the terminal output, the changes it is proposing, and the diffs. It's a contained environment for that specific unit of work. This is kind of awesome, because it isolates the context. If agent A is working on the database schema, it doesn't necessarily need to be confused by the CSS changes agent B is making on the landing page, unless you want them to be. You can review the code changes right there in the card before merging them into your actual project. It brings a level of sanity to the agentic workflow that we haven't really seen before. But let's talk critically about what Vibe Kanban is actually trying to do here. Because I think this tool represents a shift in how we think about AI programming. We are moving from co-pilots, where the AI sits next to you and helps you type, to co-workers, or agents, that go off and do a job while you do something else. Vibe Kanban is trying to be the manager for those co-workers. The most powerful aspect here is the centralized configuration. If you have used multiple CLI tools, you know the pain of setting up your environment variables, your ignored files, and your context rules for every single tool. Vibe Kanban centralizes this. You set up your MCP, or model context protocol servers in one place. You configure your project rules once, and then every agent you spawn via the board inherits that configuration. It streamlines your workflow a lot because you aren't constantly reteaching the AI how your project is structured. However, I have to be direct about the potential downsides here. This tool adds a layer of abstraction. For a lot of developers, the speed of just hitting Command K in Cursor, or typing into a terminal is hard to beat. Introducing a Kanban board adds friction. You have to create a card, type a description, assign an agent, and manage the board. For small, quick tasks, like, fix this typo or change this color, Vibe Kanban is probably overkill. It feels like bringing a construction crew to hang a picture frame. This is really designed for larger, multi-step features, where you need to decompose a problem into chunks. There is also the question of context fragmentation. While running agents in parallel sounds amazing, in practice, code is highly interdependent. If I have one agent refactoring the API response structure, and another agent building the UI that consumes that API at the same time, they are going to clash. They don't know what the other is doing until the code is merged. Vibe Kanban gives you the ability to run things in parallel. But it doesn't solve the logical problem of merge conflicts and architectural drift. You, the human, still have to be the ultimate arbiter, and make sure agent A isn't breaking agent B's work. That said, the dev server management feature is a nice touch. It allows you to spin up and monitor your localhost servers directly from the board. So you can see if the changes the agents are making are actually compiling and running without crashing. It tries to be a complete mission control center. Another thing to consider is that Vibe Kanban heavily relies on the underlying agents like Claude code or Gemini CLI. It is an orchestration layer, not the brain itself. If those tools hallucinate or get stuck in loops, Vibe Kanban can't magically fix them. It just gives you a better seat to watch the crash happen. But having that visibility is better than having a terminal window buried somewhere in the background that you forgot about. In literal seconds, you can see the status of your entire project. You can see that three tasks are done, one failed, and two are in progress. That visual feedback loop is something the terminal just cannot give you. It turns the abstract concept of AI working on my code into something tangible and trackable. It is an experiment in UI/UX for the AI era. We are still figuring out the right interface for autonomous coding. Is it a chat? Is it an IDE? Or is it a project management board like this? Vibe Kanban makes a strong argument that for complex, multi-agent work, we need structure, we need visibility, and we need to stop staring at a blinking cursor waiting for a response. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.

Because it is quite different from just chatting with a bot. When you open Vibe Kanban, you are not greeted with a chat box. You are greeted with a board. Think Trello or Jira. But instead of assigning tasks to your co-workers, who are going to ignore them for three days, you are assigning tasks to AI agents that execute them immediately. You have your standard columns like to do, in progress, in review, and done. Here is where it gets interesting. You create a card, say, refactor the authentication middleware. Instead of just typing that into a void, you assign a specific executor to that card. You can tell Claude code to handle the heavy logic, or you can assign a lighter task to a different model. But it doesn't just stop there, because this is a Kanban board. You can create five different tasks and run them in parallel. This is the killer feature. You aren't blocked waiting for Claude to finish writing a test before you can start working on the frontend component. You queue them up, hit start, and Vibe Kanban orchestrates them running in the background. It basically treats coding tasks like asynchronous jobs, rather than a blocking conversation. When you click into a specific task card, you get a dedicated view for that agent's work. It shows you the terminal output, the changes it is proposing, and the diffs. It's a contained environment for that specific unit of work. This is kind of awesome, because it isolates the context. If agent A is working on the database schema, it doesn't necessarily need to be confused by the CSS changes agent B is making on the landing page, unless you want them to be. You can review the code changes right there in the card before merging them into your actual project. It brings a level of sanity to the agentic workflow that we haven't really seen before. But let's talk critically about what Vibe Kanban is actually trying to do here. Because I think this tool represents a shift in how we think about AI programming. We are moving from co-pilots, where the AI sits next to you and helps you type, to co-workers, or agents, that go off and do a job while you do something else. Vibe Kanban is trying to be the manager for those co-workers. The most powerful aspect here is the centralized configuration. If you have used multiple CLI tools, you know the pain of setting up your environment variables, your ignored files, and your context rules for every single tool. Vibe Kanban centralizes this. You set up your MCP, or model context protocol servers in one place. You configure your project rules once, and then every agent you spawn via the board inherits that configuration. It streamlines your workflow a lot because you aren't constantly reteaching the AI how your project is structured. However, I have to be direct about the potential downsides here. This tool adds a layer of abstraction. For a lot of developers, the speed of just hitting Command K in Cursor, or typing into a terminal is hard to beat. Introducing a Kanban board adds friction. You have to create a card, type a description, assign an agent, and manage the board. For small, quick tasks, like, fix this typo or change this color, Vibe Kanban is probably overkill. It feels like bringing a construction crew to hang a picture frame. This is really designed for larger, multi-step features, where you need to decompose a problem into chunks. There is also the question of context fragmentation. While running agents in parallel sounds amazing, in practice, code is highly interdependent. If I have one agent refactoring the API response structure, and another agent building the UI that consumes that API at the same time, they are going to clash. They don't know what the other is doing until the code is merged. Vibe Kanban gives you the ability to run things in parallel. But it doesn't solve the logical problem of merge conflicts and architectural drift. You, the human, still have to be the ultimate arbiter, and make sure agent A isn't breaking agent B's work. That said, the dev server management feature is a nice touch. It allows you to spin up and monitor your localhost servers directly from the board. So you can see if the changes the agents are making are actually compiling and running without crashing. It tries to be a complete mission control center. Another thing to consider is that Vibe Kanban heavily relies on the underlying agents like Claude code or Gemini CLI. It is an orchestration layer, not the brain itself. If those tools hallucinate or get stuck in loops, Vibe Kanban can't magically fix them. It just gives you a better seat to watch the crash happen. But having that visibility is better than having a terminal window buried somewhere in the background that you forgot about. In literal seconds, you can see the status of your entire project. You can see that three tasks are done, one failed, and two are in progress. That visual feedback loop is something the terminal just cannot give you. It turns the abstract concept of AI working on my code into something tangible and trackable. It is an experiment in UI/UX for the AI era. We are still figuring out the right interface for autonomous coding. Is it a chat? Is it an IDE? Or is it a project management board like this? Vibe Kanban makes a strong argument that for complex, multi-agent work, we need structure, we need visibility, and we need to stop staring at a blinking cursor waiting for a response. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.

            "transcription": "Some would argue that Presidents Nixon through Reagan produced the cumulative presidential effects to defeat the Soviet Union. Others would say, forget this great man theory of history business, that's really passé. What really counted for the outcome of the Cold War was nuclear-armed submarines. The way deterrence theory worked during the Cold War, and I believe now as well, in order to deter the other side, you have to have a reliable second-strike capability. So if they thought of lobbing a nuke at you, they would be guaranteed that you would have the second strike to lob a nuke back. Therefore, they're never going to lob the first nuke. When Jimmy Carter became president, the United States began a much more aggressive deployment of its fleet, where we're taking our submarines and we're targeting Soviet submarines in their home water bastions. So the Soviets are thinking that we're going to be able to destroy their second-strike capability on our first strike, and they're having a heart attack. So here you have Valery Boldin, a longtime aide to Gorbachev, saying, \"Look, the most powerful strength of the United States is the naval fleet, and we aren't going to get one, or our geography actually isn't set up to use one the way the United States can.\" So when you get Marshal Akhromeyev, who's visiting the United States in 1987, he's telling his American hosts, \"You know where our submarines are, but we don't know where yours are. It's destabilizing, you! You, the United States Navy are the problem.\" Go Navy!\n"
