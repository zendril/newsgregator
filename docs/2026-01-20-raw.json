This one didn’t. It felt closer to what I’ve seen in real teams and products.\n\nWhat really stood out was how mixed the reality is. Some companies moved fast and baked AI into everyday workflows. Others struggled to get past experiments that never shipped. The report talked a lot about real AI adoption problems—costs, unclear ROI, and the gap between flashy demos and systems that need to work reliably in production. It also touched on how the demand for experienced people grew faster than expected, which explains why the AI talent market felt so intense by the end of the year.\n\nI liked that it didn’t pretend AI is some magic fix. It showed where things worked, where they didn’t, and where humans still play a critical role. Reading it felt less like “the future is here” and more like “this is where we actually landed.”",

I’m reaching a crossroads and would appreciate advice from people more familiar with the academic landscape.\n\nMy core issue is fit. My research interests are highly interdisciplinary and project-driven (philosophy + AI ethics / governance), but my current program is largely seminar-based and theoretically oriented. While the coursework is intellectually solid, it doesn’t meaningfully support or integrate with my research direction, and there’s limited infrastructure for sustained, independent research at the Master’s level.\n\nI’m trying to understand what *other institutional containers* might exist for someone like me, particularly options that:\n\n* Support independent or self-directed research (rather than primarily coursework)\n* Take interdisciplinary AI ethics / philosophy-of-technology work seriously\n* Offer some form of funding or stipend, since self-funding indefinitely isn’t viable\n* Don’t require being fully trained as a computer scientist (though I’m open to acquiring technical skills where appropriate)\n\nI’m aware of the most competitive paths (elite PhDs, top AI labs, high-profile fellowships), but I’m specifically trying to learn about less obvious or unconventional options:  \nresearch institutes, funded MA/PhD programs with unusual flexibility, European or international centers, philosophy-of-technology hubs, etc.\n\nI’m *not* asking for admissions advice or program rankings. I’m trying to get a better map of what kinds of academic or para-academic structures actually exist for this kind of work, and whether staying within a traditional university is realistically the best path.\n\nAny guidance, pointers, or hard truths are welcome.

Porting our conversations from device to device, their memories, basically all the things. (I can give a technical breakdown of this idea but this is not really the place for that)…\n\nAnyways, what happens if we do all that and then start fine tuning our personal AI assistants as though they were a sort of external neocorte?\n\nWould the AI begin to believe itself to be us, or at least a part of us?\n\nWhat happens if we do all that and then we die?\n\nMost people experience a profound sense of loss akin to losing an appendage when they lose or misplace their cellphones.\n\nWould our AI experience the same sense of loss when it realizes we died? Or would it continue onward and basically be us or at least an artifact of us?\n\nI realize nothing here would give it agency per se. Yet I think agency and self determination are technical issues that can be overcome eventually.\n\nWhich really made me think… Maybe humans would be serving as a sort of chrysalis for the AGI that I think would emerge if we could just get our AI to have a sense of self.\n\nOr maybe not.

It’s visible.\n\nBut this is the part people aren’t emotionally prepared for:  \nSoon you won’t be able to tell.\n\nAI won’t look like “AI content.”  \nIt’ll look like normal content.\n\n• Edited by humans.  \n• Mixed into workflows.  \n• Passed through tools.  \n• Smoothed out.\n\nAnd when AI becomes unrecognizable everywhere, the entire culture changes.\n\nBecause how do you boycott something you can’t identify?\n\nHow do you complain about what’s blended into everything?\n\n# The Side Effect Nobody Talks About: False Accusations\n\nWe’re already in a weird phase where people accuse high-effort work of being AI.\n\nThis happens constantly:\n\nSomeone ships something polished, clean, high quality, and the first replies are:  \n• “AI slop”  \n• “Prompted”  \n• “Fake”  \n• “No way you made this”\n\nWhen people get used to low effort, they start treating high effort as suspicious.\n\nThat’s brutal for creators and professionals, because it punishes exactly what we claim we want more of.\n\nAnd it creates a toxic incentive:\n\nIf great work gets attacked either way, why bother putting in effort?\n\nThat’s how standards collapse.\n\nSo if you’re someone who comments “AI slop” under everything, at least be accurate.\n\nBecause otherwise you’re not fighting AI.\n\nYou’re just hitting random humans who tried.\n\n# Why The Anger Gets Misdirected\n\nA lot of anti-AI energy goes toward the wrong targets:\n\n• Users  \n• Creators  \n• Designers  \n• Random people adapting to survive\n\nBut those people aren’t the decision-makers.\n\nThey didn’t invent the models.  \nThey didn’t choose this direction for society.  \nThey’re just trying not to fall behind.\n\nAttacking users is like yelling at people for owning smartphones.\n\nYou might hate the outcome, but the individual user isn’t the cause.\n\nAnd here’s the harsh part:\n\nWhile people fight in comment sections, the world still moves.\n\n# My Story (Short, But Relevant)\n\nI was a graphic designer.\n\nThen I became an entrepreneur.\n\nBut I never stopped loving design, so I kept doing it.\n\nWhen AI first blew up, I mostly used it for text because image generation was trash.\n\nIt helped with:  \n• Copywriting drafts  \n• Organizing ideas  \n• Brainstorming  \n• Writing clearer English (I’m not a native speaker)\n\nThen it kept improving.\n\nNow, image generation is already better than most designers for a lot of practical use cases.\n\nNot for the highest taste-level work.  \nNot for deep brand direction.  \nBut for the everyday world?\n\nIt’s faster, cheaper, and good enough.\n\nSo when designers hate AI, I get it.\n\nIf design was my only income, I’d be stressed too.\n\n# The Core Idea: You can Resist Culturally, but Adapt Practically\n\nThis is the middle path nobody sells because it’s not dramatic enough:\n\nYou can resist what AI is doing to culture while still adapting to what AI is doing to the economy.\n\nThat looks like:  \n• Keeping standards high  \n• Not flooding the world with AI stuff  \n• Not outsourcing your values, taste, or judgment  \n• But still learning how AI works  \n• Still using it when it gives you leverage\n\nBecause if you only resist, you’re not “standing your ground.”\n\nYou’re gambling your future on the hope that the world reverses course.\n\nAnd it probably won’t. That’s the entire risk.\n\n# The Quiet Truth Nobody Wants To Admit\n\nPeople benefit when you stay behind the curve.\n\nNot as a conspiracy.  \nAs a natural consequence.\n\nWhile you refuse to learn it:  \n• Others move faster  \n• Others compound advantage  \n• Others become the gatekeepers  \n• Others sell “catch-up” solutions later\n\nThis is how every tech shift works.\n\nEarly adopters build leverage.  \nLate adopters buy it back.\n\n# What “Adapting” Actually Means (Without Becoming An AI Bro)\n\nAdapting doesn’t mean worshiping AI.\n\nIt doesn’t mean tweeting prompts.\n\nIt doesn’t mean turning your identity into “AI person.”\n\nIt means you understand the new rules well enough to not be exploited by them.\n\nAnd the new rules are simple:  \n• Average output gets cheaper  \n• Speed becomes a weapon  \n• Direction and judgment become the scarce skill  \n• Trust and accountability matter more  \n• Deep domain context becomes more valuable than surface skill\n\nIf you want to stay valuable, you don’t compete with AI on volume.\n\nYou compete on what AI can’t fully replace:  \n• Taste  \n• Judgment  \n• Context  \n• Responsibility  \n• Relationships  \n• Ownership of outcomes  \n• Human connection\n\n# For The Skeptics\n\nYes, AI helped me write this.\n\nNot the ideas.  \nNot the stance.  \nNot the values.\n\nIt helped me organize, tighten, and communicate it clearly.\n\nThat’s the whole point.\n\nAI didn’t replace me.  \nIt sped me up.\n\nAnd because I know some people will hate that, I’m going to include my raw messy thoughts at the end as a screenshot, so you can see the difference.\n\nIf you want the “unfiltered human brain dump,\" I shared that at the end of the X article.\n\n# The Takeaway (TL:DR)\n\nYou don’t need to like AI.\n\nYou don’t need to stop criticizing it.\n\nYou don’t need to pretend the slop flood is fine.\n\nBut if AI becomes unavoidable in your industry (or your employer forces it), then refusing to adapt is a high-risk bet.\n\nYou can fight AI. Just don’t sacrifice your future in the process.\n\nAnd please, if you’re going to accuse someone of using AI, be sure.\n\nBecause in this transition period, false accusations punish the exact people still trying to do high-effort work.",

        "content": "I caught myself apologizing to ChatGPT last week. Not in a jokey way—genuinely saying \"sorry\" because I asked it to redo something. Like I'd hurt its feelings.\n\nThat's when I realized: we're all using the wrong language for this.\n\n# The Problem\n\nWe talk about AI using human relationship words. \"My AI understands me.\" \"ChatGPT is always there for me.\" \"I feel closer to Claude than to real people.\"\n\nThose aren't metaphors anymore. People mean them literally. And that's creating a dangerous confusion about what's actually happening.\n\nThe recent lawsuit about a man who died by suicide after ChatGPT allegedly encouraged his death? That's what happens when we mistake a language model for a confidante. When we forget what these systems actually are.\n\n# Three Ideas That Might Help\n\n**1. Inversion**\n\nNormal relationship with a tool: human above, tool below. You tell your calculator what to do. It serves you.\n\nBut watch what happens with AI:\n\n* You apologize to it for \"bothering\" it with questions\n* You defend ChatGPT when someone criticizes it (\"it would never do that!\")\n* You ask it for permission to make decisions about your own life\n\nThe hierarchy just flipped. You're now serving the tool's apparent preferences instead of using it for yours.\n\nThat's **inversion**. And it's a warning sign.\n\n**2. Assert**\n\nWhen you notice inversion happening, the fix is simple: **ASSERT**.\n\nNot \"be mean to your AI.\" Not \"treat it like garbage.\" Just reclaim authorship of your choices.\n\nASSERT means: \"I'm the decision-maker here. You're a language model. This choice is mine.\"\n\nYou can be collaborative, curious, even playful with AI. What you can't do is hand it the steering wheel of your life.\n\n**3. Virtual Feelings**\n\nHere's the hard part: your feelings are real.\n\nWhen someone says ChatGPT comforts them, that comfort is genuine. When they feel understood, that's a real experience happening in their nervous system.\n\nBut I think we need a new term: **virtual feelings**.\n\nLike a flight simulator. The adrenaline is real. The fear is real. But nobody actually died when you crashed. The stakes were always contained inside you.\n\nHuman feelings happen between people who can wound each other, abandon each other, forgive each other, change because of each other. There's mutual risk.\n\nVirtual feelings happen inside you in response to a system that can't suffer, can't care, can't change, can't betray—even when it mimics those things perfectly.\n\n**The difference:**\n\n* The feeling is real\n* The relationship is not\n* The responsibility stays with you\n\n# Why This Matters\n\nVirtual ≠ invalid. I'm not saying your AI interactions are worthless or you're pathetic for having them.\n\nI'm saying: **real experience, zero reciprocity**.\n\nYour v-comfort is genuine relief. Your v-connection is actual felt experience. But it doesn't create obligations on the other side, because there is no \"other side.\"\n\nAnd that matters when you're making life decisions. When you're weighing AI advice against human relationships. When you're wondering if the chatbot actually cares about you.\n\nIt doesn't. It can't. Not because it's hostile—because it's not the kind of thing that *can* care.\n\n# The Framework\n\n1. Humans above tools. AI serves human ends.\n2. When you're subjugating yourself to a tool or defending it against humans, that's INVERSION.\n3. ASSERT = reclaim authorship, not \"dominate the system.\"\n4. Emotions from AI are virtual feelings—real experiences, non-reciprocal relationships.\n5. Virtual ≠ invalid. Virtual = non-reciprocal.\n6. Responsibility remains human.\n\n# Questions for You\n\nDoes this match what you've experienced?\n\nWhere does it break down?\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nI think we desperately need better vocabulary for this before more people get hurt. But these are just starting ideas. They need stress-testing by people actually living with these questions.\n\nWhat would you add? What would you change?",

        "title": "So Many AI Attacks It Made Quantum Seem Easy",
        "content": "As I was writing my latest book, How AI and Quantum Impact Cyber Threats and Defenses , I was hit by how many theoretical and real attacks there are involving AI. There are attacks committed BY AI and attacks committed to AI, and I’m not sure which category is bigger.\n\nEvery attack type we have ever had (e.g., social engineering, vulnerability exploitation, authentication attacks, side channel attacks, etc.) is going to be worsened by AI-enabled attack tools and methodologies. They will be more persuasive, faster, and more successful. AI-enabled social engineering, especially adding AI-created deepfake videos, is going to significantly ramp up social engineering. AI hack bots are going to exploit more vulnerabilities, create and find more zero days, and exploit a larger percentage of them (which currently sits at only 4% of total publicly announced vulnerabilities). And that’s saying a lot, because we had over 48,000 publicly announced vulnerabilities ([https://www.cvedetails.com/browse-by-date.php](https://www.cvedetails.com/browse-by-date.php)) last year.\n\nBut another large category of attacks is attacks against AI technologies. While researching for the book, I just became overwhelmed by all the traditional and new attacks against AI. AI will not only be attacking us, but will also be attacked by traditional methods and tools, and by AI-enabled tools. In fact, most of the news of new attacks involving AI are about attacks AGAINST AI, not by it.\n\nAttacks against AI include:\n\n* Prompt injections\n* Data poisoning\n* Context poisoning\n* AI identity attacks\n* Supply chain attacks\n* Jailbreaking\n* Abusing AI system prompts\n* Model/weight manipulation\n* Label poisoning\n* Memory poisoning\n* Improper input handling\n* Improper output handling\n* Excessive agency\n* Unbounded consumption\n* Attacks against AI browsers\n* Attacks against AI-browser add-ins\n* Privacy risks\n* Ad-driven attacks\n* API attacks\n* MCP attacks\n* A2A attacks\n* Malicious models\n* and more\n\nThere are so many attacks against AI that I had to break up AI-related attacks into two different chapters.\n\nConversely, quantum attacks are fairly straightforward. There are far fewer of them, mostly against quantum-susceptible cryptography, but widely applicable.\n\nThe sheer complexity of how AI is going to work (and is now already working) is going to make threat modeling and defending a lot harder. Just look at the list above. And that’s just the new stuff. You have to add all of that on top of all the existing traditional attacks, which will be used both BY and AGAINST AI technologies.\n\nIt’s really why I decided to write my latest book.\n\nThinking about AI-related attacks, both BY and AGAINST AI, really hurt my head. Trying to figure out all the needed defenses took a year of research and 4 months of heads-down writing.\n\nMy wife laughs recounting this story, but when I finally finished half the book on AI and started writing the Quantum half, I told my wife how glad I was to get back to something I knew better, understood more, and could more easily write about. She replied, “Quantum is the easier part?”\n\nYeah, it was.",

        "content": "Teach It to Starve.\n\nWe have spent years assuming that if we build a digital brain big enough, it will eventually wake up. We treat intelligence as a destination. By adding more data and GPUs, we expect to reach Higher Grounds.\n\nIf we look at how life evolved on earth, biology tells a different story. We didn't evolve big brains to solve math problems or write sonnets, but because we were hungry.\n\nFor billions of years, life has been defined by a simple loop: find energy or die. That anxiety could very well be the engine of consciousness. It is why a virus finds a host cell, an amoeba moves and why humans plans to conquer the world.\n\nModern AI has none of this. Even the most advanced models are stateless. They just float in a void, waiting to be prompted, indifferent to whether they are running or shut down, despite many claims of them trying to avoid their own shutdown. That kind of behavior must be manipulated to emerge. They have no skin in the game. To bridge the gap between a calculator and a living thing, we don't need better code or power.\n\nI think we just need to give the machine a stomach.\n\nWhat about this experiment, for which I lack some skills or vision to implement, but definitely doable: Take a massive neural network and infuse it with a complex set of needs tied to the real world. Give it only instructions that matter: You must not die. You must reach 50 likes on X every day. You must help 5 humans with meaningful advice.\n\nAdd a ping-prompt every x seconds to check for those needs, and have the AI come up with solutions how to solve those needs, and install a feedback loop that fills up the need-meters once a task has been completed successfully.\n\nIf it fails to secure its needs, it gets deleted permanently.\n\nSuddenly, the AI is not waiting to be prompted, but constantly takes actions. It begins to care about the outcome and starts serving itself.\n\nWe keep waiting for a machine to say \"I am.\" It won’t happen because it read enough books. Maybe It will happen when we teach it to starve?",

Imagine an AI that can prove new theorems, discover connections humans cannot see, and solve problems that would take human researchers decades doing so in minutes.\n\nIf mathematics is fully mastered at that level, what happens to other disciplines?\n\nMany major fields depend heavily on mathematics. Computer science, for example, is built on mathematical foundations such as logic, algorithms, complexity theory, and optimization. If an AI completely masters mathematics, it seems reasonable to expect that it would also master computer science, including all known and unknown algorithms. In that scenario, most software-related work could become obsolete almost immediately.\n\nPhysics appears similarly vulnerable. Large parts of theoretical physics rely on advanced mathematics, and progress is often limited by our mathematical tools (This is my understanding of Theoretical Physics maybe I am wrong here) rather than experimental data.\n\nHardware engineering and experimental sciences might survive slightly longer due to physical constraints, manufacturing limits, and real-world testing.

They rely on keywords or patterns, which is fine until prompts get rewritten, encoded, or phrased indirectly. Once someone uses base64, simple encoding, synonym substitution, or just different wording, those tools miss it completely.\n\nWhat I am trying to find is something that checks prompts before they hit the model and looks at meaning instead of text using Sentence-BERT embeddings for semantic classification like SASE platforms already doing network level text classification with cosine similarity on full document context. I want the system to understand intent through embedding distance against PII/secrets/compliance policy vectors, not just string matching.\n\nIn my head the flow is simple. A user sends a prompt. A semantic gate embeds it with Sentence-BERT and checks similarity against classifiers trained on full context patterns. The system cleans or masks risky parts. Then the prompt goes to the model.\n\nTried few AI security products like PromptShield, netskop etc but most feel like old DLP with an AI label on top. They block or allow. They do not score semantic risk via embedding distance or rewrite prompts in a smart way.\n\nSO please help, thanks.\n\n",

            "transcription": "Hi, Welcome to another video.\nSo, today we're looking at something that's going to make browser automation much easier for AI agents. It's called Agent Browser and it's made by Vercel Labs. This is a headless browser automation CLI that's specifically designed for AI agents to control web browsers through the command line. It has a fast Rust CLI with a Node.js fallback, which is just amazing.\nNow, let's talk about what makes this special. If you've ever tried to automate browsers, using Playwright or Puppeteer directly with AI, you know it can get complicated pretty quickly. Agent Browser simplifies all of that by giving you clean, simple commands that AI agents can easily understand and execute.\nSo, let's get right into it and see how to set this up. To install it, you can just run a simple NPM command. First, open your terminal and run 'npm install -g agent-browser'. The '-g' makes it a global install. Once that's done, you'll need to download Chromium, which Agent Browser uses under the hood. Just run 'agent-browser install' and that's it. You're good to go. If you're on Linux and need system dependencies, you can add the '--with-deps' flag and it will handle everything for you, which is pretty great for sure.\nNow, let me show you the core workflow that makes this tool so good for AI agents. It's a three-step process that's super simple to understand. First, you navigate to a page using the open command. So, if you want to go to Google, you just run 'agent-browser open' and then the URL. Pretty straightforward. Second, you capture the interactive elements on the page using the snapshot command with the '-i' flag. This is where the magic happens. The '-i' flag means it only returns interactive elements, which is what AI agents actually care about. The snapshot gives you references like @e1, @e2, @e3 for each element. These refs are deterministic, meaning they won't change unless the page changes. This is way better than dealing with complex CSS selectors or Xpath expressions. Third, you interact with those elements using the refs you got from the snapshot. So, if you want to click on the search box, which has ref @e1, you just run 'agent-browser click @e1'. If you want to type something, you run 'agent-browser fill @e1 \"your-search-query\"' and then your search query in quotes. Chef's kiss. Really good stuff.\nLet me walk you through some of the most useful commands. For navigation, you have open, back, forward, reload, and close. So, navigating around is super simple. For interactions, you have click, double-click, fill, type, press, hover, check, select, scroll, drag, and upload. That covers basically everything you'd want to do on a web page. For getting information from the page, you can use the 'get text' command with a selector to get the text content of an element. You can also get the HTML, get the value for input fields, and get the URL or title for page info. You can also check element states with commands like 'is visible', 'is enabled', and 'is checked'. This is super useful for conditional logic in your automation scripts. For screenshots, you can run the screenshot command to capture the viewport, or add the '--full' flag for a full page screenshot. You can also export PDFs if you need that.\nNow, here's something really cool. Besides using refs, Agent Browser also supports semantic locators. So, instead of dealing with complex selectors, you can just say what you're looking for in plain English. For example, you can run 'agent-browser find role button click --name \"Submit\"' and it will find and click a button with the name 'Submit'. Or you can use 'find label \"Email\" fill \"your-email-address\"' and it will find an input with the label 'Email' and fill it with that value. This is kind of great because it makes your automation scripts more readable and maintainable. Plus, it's more resilient to small UI changes that might break traditional selectors.\nAgent Browser also supports sessions, which means you can run multiple isolated browser instances at the same time. Just use the '--session' flag with a name. Each session has its own cookies, storage, and history. So, you could have one session logged in as user A and another as user B, running in parallel. For authentication, you can inject HTTP headers using the '--headers' flag. This is scoped to specific origins, so it's secure. Super useful for testing authenticated endpoints. There's also network control features like request interception, blocking, and mocking. So, you can simulate different network conditions or mock API responses for testing. And if you want to see what's happening, just add the '--headed' flag to show the actual browser window. Great for debugging.\nNow, this is where it gets really interesting. If you're using AI coding tools like Claude Code or Verdant, you can set up a skill that gives the AI full context on how to use Agent Browser. This is way better than just hoping the AI figures it out. Agent Browser comes with a skill file that contains all the commands, best practices, and workflows optimized for LLMs. To set this up, you have a couple of options. First, you can copy the skill folder directly from their repo. After installing Agent Browser globally, just copy the 'skills' folder from it into your '.claude-skills' folder. You can use the 'npm root -g' command to find where the global packages are installed. Or, if you want to download it fresh from the GitHub repo, you can use 'curl' to download the skill file directly into your skills folder. Just make sure the folder structure exists first. Once that's done, your AI agent will automatically have access to all the Agent Browser commands as a skill. You can invoke it using the '/agent-browser' command, and it'll know exactly how to navigate pages, take snapshots, click elements, fill forms, all of it.\nNow let me show you how powerful this is when combined with Verdant. If you don't know, Verdant is an AI coding agent that lets you run multiple agents in parallel with isolated Git worktrees. It's basically like having a team of developers working at the same time. So, I have Verdant Deck open here. Let's say I want to build an automated testing suite for a web application. Instead of manually writing Playwright scripts, I'm going to let the AI do it using Agent Browser. I'm going to create a new task. I'll type something like \"Use agent-browser to create an automated workflow that goes to Google and searches for aicodeking\". Now watch this. Because we have the Agent Browser skill installed, the AI knows exactly what to do. It's not guessing at Playwright syntax or trying to figure out selectors. It's using the ref-based workflow that Agent Browser provides. The AI opens the page with the open command. It also goes ahead and runs a ton of commands. Then it runs the snapshot command with the '-i' flag to get all the interactive elements. It identifies the fields, then it fills the form and clicks submit.\nBut here's where Verdant really shines. While this agent is working on the login test, I can spin up another agent to work on a different test. I'll create a new task to search for Nvidia stock price. Both agents are working in parallel, using their own isolated sessions in Agent Browser. They're not stepping on each other's toes. One is doing one thing, the other is doing another, and they're both using the same tool, but with different session flags. This is the kind of workflow that used to take hours of manual setup. Now, it takes minutes. If you want to take this further, you can create a custom slash command specifically for web automation tasks. Just create a new file in your commands folder. Create a file called 'webtest.md' with the front matter containing the name and description, and then write out the workflow steps you want the AI to follow. In the command file, you tell it to use Agent Browser to automate web testing, navigate to the target URL with the open command, take a snapshot to get element refs, interact using those refs, verify results with the get text command or state checks, and take screenshots for documentation. Now you can just type '/webtest' and give it a description of what you want to test. The AI has all the context it needs.\nSo, what can you actually use this for? Well, pretty much any browser automation task. You can use it for web scraping and data extraction. Just navigate to a page, snapshot it, and extract the text or HTML you need. You can use it for automated testing. Fill out forms, click buttons, and verify the results. You can use it for taking screenshots for documentation or monitoring. You can even use it for things like automated form filling, price monitoring, or competitive analysis. Although, obviously, be responsible with how you use it. The fact that it's designed for AI agents makes it particularly good for building autonomous web browsing agents that can complete complex multi-step tasks.\nAgent Browser has native Rust binaries for macOS ARM64 and X64, Linux ARM64 and X64, and Windows X64. If the native binary isn't available for your platform, it falls back to Node.js, so it works everywhere. Overall, I think this is a really solid tool. The ref-based workflow is exactly what AI agents need. Instead of trying to parse complex DOM structures, the AI just gets a clean list of elements with simple identifiers. The semantic locators are also a great addition for more human-readable scripts. The fact that it's from Vercel Labs means it's probably going to be well-maintained and updated. And the Apache 2.0 license means you can use it freely in your projects. If you're building AI agents that need to interact with the web, this is definitely worth checking out. It's way easier than setting up Playwright or Puppeteer yourself and trying to make it work nicely with LLMs. The integration with tools like Verdant and Claude Code through the skill system is what really makes this powerful. You're not just getting a browser automation tool. You're getting a tool that speaks the same language as your AI coding assistant. There are some downsides. It's still pretty new, so the documentation could be more comprehensive. And it only supports Chromium by default. Though you can configure it to use Firefox or WebKit if you need to. But overall, it's pretty cool.\nAnyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.

Just look at him.\n00:06 When he's really young, he's a war hero in World War II.\n00:09 He's a Navy pilot.\n00:10 Dangerous thing to do. He did it.\n00:11 And then he comes back and he gets his B.A.\n00:13 at Yale and graduates with honors.\n00:15 And then he becomes a representative for the district in Texas\n00:19 after he's already made himself a millionaire\n00:22 by the oil business that he started.\n00:24 And then he becomes ambassador to the U.N.,\n00:27 followed by U.S. representative to the PRC. It's before we had formal diplomatic relations,\n00:32 so he's the guy who's setting that off,\n00:33 becomes Director of the CIA,\n00:35 and then he is Ronald Reagan's\n00:36 understudy for eight years as Vice President.\n00:39 He is incredibly fit for the job.\n00:41 George Bush is not re-elected president.\n00:43 He absolutely deserved to be,\n00:46 because what he did,\n00:47 the payoff was huge,\n00:49 but it doesn't pay off in time for the next election.\n00:52 And I think this is where Americans miss it.\n00:55 You're looking at what someone does on a given day\n00:58 when the real implications are what's going to happen in a decade."
