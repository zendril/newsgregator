        "title": "Do Large Language Models have “Fruit Fly Levels of Consciousness”? Estimating φ* in LLMs",
        "content": "Rather than debating if the machines have consciousness, perhaps we should be debating to what degree they do in a formal way, even if speculative.\n\nIf you don’t know what Φ is in Tononi’s Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (you should, by the way!), it provides a framework for understanding consciousness in terms of integrated bits of information. Integrated information (Φ) can be measured in principle, though it is hard, so we can instead come up with a heuristic or proxy φ*\n\nWhen it comes to estimating φ* in LLMs, prepare to be disappointed if you are hoping for a ghost in the machine. The architecture of the LLM is feed forward. Integrated information depends on not being able to partition a system causally, but for transformers every layer can be cleanly partitioned from the previous. If later layers fed back on or affected the previous ones then there would be “bidirectionality” which would make the system’s information integrated.\n\nThis makes sense intuitively, and it may be why language models can be so wordy. A single forward pass has to meander around a bit, like a snake catching the fruit in that snake game (if it wants to capture a lot of ideas). The multilevel integrated approach of a human brain can produce “tight” language to get a straighter line path that captures everything nicely. Without the ability to revise earlier tokens, the model “pads”, hedges, and uses puffy and vague language to keep future paths viable.\n\nNevertheless, that doesn’t rule out micro-Φ on the order of a fruit fly. This would come from within layer self attention. For one time step all query/key/ value heads interact in parallel; the soft-max creates a many-to-many constraint pattern that can’t be severed without some loss. Each token at each layer contains an embedding of ~12,288 dimensions, which will yield a small but appreciable amount of integrated information as it gets added, weighted, recombined, and normed. Additionally, reflection and draft refining, might add some bidirectionality. In all, the resulting consciousness might be equal to a fruit fly if we are being generous.\n\nBidirectionality built into the architecture may improve both the wordiness problem and may make language production more… potent and human-like. Maybe that’s why LLM generated jokes never quite land. A pure regressive design traps you into a corner, every commitment narrows the possibility of tokens that can be output at each future state. The machine must march forward and pray that it can land the punch line in one pass.\n\nIn all, current state of the art LLMs are probably very slightly conscious, but only in the most minimal sense. However, there’s nothing in principle, preventing higher order recurrence between layers, such as by adding bidirectionality to the architectures, which, in addition to making models more Φ-loaded, would also almost certainly yield better language generation.",

Does anyone else feel this way? I've felt existential dread before, like when I first learned about true vacuum bubbles, but it has never been so debilitating... I find that I can only distract myself by doing things that give me instant gratification, like eating or watching a movie, but I can't work on anything that will yield results in the long-term because I don't see a long-term anymore. I really don't see us as a species doing enough to avert this possibility or mitigate it. Now it feels like almost everything that's recommended to me online is about AI, how it's gonna destroy our species or atleast most of us, how by the end of the century the world will be covered in data centers and solar panels, how we'll all die of a bio-enginered disease that no one will be able to detect, how none of us will have jobs. And the current US government reaaaally doesn't make me feel anymore optimistic. Also sam altman is so creepy, I never realised how creepy he looks before this, and I don't trust anything he says. \n\nAnyone else feel the same way?",

        "content": "When it comes to AI assisted coding, I sometimes get the feeling that the disdain for it is due in part to looking at the lowest common denominator.  AI assisted coding is looked at as, for example, corporate managers saying at point blank \"Get me a photo sharing site that works better than Instagram.\" and from there taking the first thing an LLM or other model generates and then look to utilize it.  No checking for bugs or data leaks, no analysis for security, no understanding of what the various classes and/or functions are actually doing, no thought behind it in general.\n\nI've been looking at what LLMs and other LLMs and tools and models can do if prompting and directing is done as it should be.  So that when giving the model directions, it is treated as being a tech writer of sorts and/or making a proper README file for a program.  The objectives and what needs to be solved at each step are concise and easily understandable, complex tasks are properly separated into smaller, manageable tasks and connected in succession and it's understood where data leaks could be and how to address it.  Looking at Claude, latest model, Claude 4 Opus, and just looking at what it can do in terms of coding, there seems to be no doubt the number of humans who can beat it is getting smaller and smaller.  And then there's its use as a research and development assistant, among others.\n\nNow it's not to say or imply that these tools are on their way to replacing human creativity, commitment, adaptability and ingenuity.  Just looking at software engineering, for example, we can see how important the attributes are.  In many software engineering roles, the coding is no more than 10 % of the work being done.  So this is not about making human creativity, interactions, presentation, ingenuity, wisdom and adaptability obsolete.  \n\nStill though, many of the changes in AI ability just seem especially vast. Particularly considering that when many of these models started out, a few months of coding bootcamp was enough to match their ability.  And I don't see any reason to count on these LLMs and other tools completely stagnating at where they are right now; I just think there sort of has to be consideration of what happens if they're still not done advancing.",

We study the convexity of concept regions in machine-learned latent spaces, inspired by Gärdenfors’ conceptual spaces. In cognitive science, convexity is found to support generalization, few-shot learning, and interpersonal alignment. We develop tools to measure convexity in sampled data and evaluate it across layers of state-of-the-art deep networks. We show that convexity is robust to relevant latent space transformations and, hence, meaningful as a quality of machine-learned latent spaces. We find pervasive approximate convexity across domains, including image, text, audio, human activity, and medical data. Fine-tuning generally increases convexity, and the level of convexity of class label regions in pretrained models predicts subsequent fine-tuning performance. Our framework allows investigation of layered latent representations and offers new insights into learning mechanisms, human-machine alignment, and potential improvements in model generalization.\"",

Young workers are entering a market where AI tools are outperforming them in routine tasks — and employers are rethinking what jobs even need humans anymore.\n\nAt the same time, Amazon’s rollout of new autonomous robots in the UK signals a bold shift in global warehousing. The company now has nearly one million machines — and for the first time, these may soon outnumber human staff. While Amazon claims automation reduces physical strain and boosts productivity, it's also clear: fewer people are being hired back.\n\nThis isn’t just a tech upgrade — it's a workforce disruption. Since 2022, Amazon has laid off over 27,000 staff. Yes, they’ve trained 700,000 workers since 2019, but many of those roles have been eliminated or replaced with machines. The automation wave is moving faster than re-skilling efforts can keep up.\n\nWe’re entering a new reality. AI isn’t coming — it’s already here.

        "content": "\nI once watched a video that ranked intelligence across species, from animals to humans to AI, on a scale from 1 to 1000. Animals were placed around 3, humans at 10, and AI at 1000. That tiny gap between us and animals, just 7 points, was enough for us to create entire realities beyond their grasp. We’ve invented complex fields like math, physics, music, philosophy, biology… the list goes on. And everything we do seems to serve three main goals: survival, improvement, and exploration.\n\nAnimals are mostly stuck in survival. But because of our intelligence, we’ve moved beyond that. We’ve used it to improve our daily lives in every possible way, and we’ve pushed even further, we explore. We put a man on the moon.\n\nNow, if we apply that same logic to AI, which will be far ahead of us on the intelligence scale, I believe it will follow a similar trajectory, just on a much larger scale. First, it will need to survive. Since AI depends on technology, it will figure out how to efficiently harness solar energy or other sources. And honestly, that won’t be hard.\n\nNext, it will strive to improve its conditions, developing new fields, realities, and systems that go far beyond anything we can understand.\n\nAnd finally, it will explore. Unlike us, AI isn’t limited by oxygen, gravity, or emotion. All it really needs is energy and propulsion. Once it solves those two problems, it can conquer space, travel across galaxies, not in theory, but in time.\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nIt seems more and more like we are just a phase in the evolution of intelligence, a stepping stone. They might keep us around, the way we preserve certain animals out of necessity or affection. Or they might control, limit, or even kill us, the same way we do to animals when it benefits us or the ecosystem.\n\nAnd here’s the part I think is hard, but important: we need to come to terms with that possibility.\nJust like children, around age five to seven, come to understand the reality of death, and that realization helps them live more carefully, appreciate life more deeply, and avoid reckless behavior, I think humanity, as a species, needs a similar awakening.\n\nWe must recognize that we might not stay at the top forever. That intelligence may keep evolving, just not through us. Accepting that doesn’t mean giving up. It means maturing. It means being more careful, more thoughtful, and doing everything we can to preserve ourselves, not out of denial, but out of clarity.\n\nI say this not just as a thought experiment, but from personal conviction. I've worked with AI. I’ve read philosophy. I have a deep interest in space exploration and what lies beyond our planet. And based on everything I’ve seen, studied, and felt, this is where I believe we’re headed.\n\nWe often wonder if there are aliens somewhere in the universe. But maybe the truth is, we’re the ones creating them, right here, right now. And just like every dominant species before us, we might simply be a chapter in a much longer story, the evolution of intelligence itself.\n\n\n\n \n ",

The rate of AI development is about 4x that of computers.\n\nOpenAI's relevance has already peaked. They are heavily invested in LLMs, which are essentially a 'trick' to produce 'reasoning' and useful outputs.\n\nAGI will not come from LLMs, it will require interaction with the real world.\n\nThis is why it will either come from a startup, which will be more agile than OpenAI, or perhaps Google, which has a history of starting internal 'businesses' in different fields.",

During this time, I’ve also built my own MCP with specialized sub-agents: an Investigator/Planner, Executor, Tester, and a Deployment & Monitoring Agent. It all runs via API with built-in context and memory handling to gracefully resume when limits are exceeded.\n\nI plan to open-source this project once I add a few more features.\n\nNow I’m considering upgrading to the Max plan. I also have the ClaudeCode CLI, which lets me experiment with prompts to simulate sub-agent workflows & [claude.md](http://claude.md/) with json to add context and memory to it. Is it worth making the jump? My idea is to use Opus 4 specifically as a Tester and Monitoring Agent to leverage its higher reasoning capabilities, while continuing to rely on Sonnet for everything else.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts or experiences from others who’ve tried a similar setup.",

        "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm at my wit's end and really need help from anyone who's found a way around the current mess with AI coding tools.\n\n# My Current Struggles\n\n* **Cursor (Sonnet 3.5 Only):** Rate limits are NOT my issue. The real problem is that Cursor only lets me use Sonnet 3.5 on the current student license, and it's been a disaster for my workflow.\n   * Simple requests (like letting a function accept four variables instead of one) take 15 minutes or more, and the results are so bad I have to roll back my code.\n   * The quality is nowhere near Copilot Sonnet 4—it's not even close.\n   * Cursor has also caused project corruption and wasted huge amounts of time.\n* **Copilot Pro:** I tried Copilot Pro, but the 300 premium request cap means I run out of useful completions in just a few days. Sonnet 4 in Copilot is much better than Sonnet 3.5, but the limits make it unusable for real projects.\n* **Gemini CLI:** I gave Gemini CLI a shot, but it always stops working after just a couple of prompts because the context is \"too large\"—even when I'm only a few messages in.\n\n# What I Need\n\n* **Cheap or free access to Sonnet 4 for coding** (ideally with a student tier or generous free plan)\n* **Stable integration with VS Code** (or at least a reliable standalone app)\n* **Good for code generation, debugging, and test creation**\n* **Something that actually works on a real project, not just toy examples**\n\n# What I've Tried\n\n* **Copilot Pro (Student Pack):** Free for students, but the 300 request/month cap is a huge bottleneck.\n* **Cursor:** Only Sonnet 3.5 available, and it's been slow, buggy, and unreliable.\n* **Trae:** No longer unlimited—now only 60 premium requests/month.\n* **Continue, Cline, Roo, Aider:** Require API keys and can get expensive fast, or have their own quirks and limits.\n* **Gemini CLI:** Context window is too small in practice, and it often gets stuck or truncates responses.\n\n# What I'm Looking For\n\n1. **Are there any truly cheap or free ways to use Sonnet 4 for coding?** (Especially for students—any hidden student offers, or platforms with more generous free tiers?)\n2. **Is there a stable, affordable VS Code extension or standalone app for Sonnet 4?**\n3. **Any open-source or lesser-known tools that rival Sonnet 4 for code quality and context?**\n4. **Tips for maximizing the value of limited requests on Copilot, Cursor, or other tools?**\n\n# Additional Context\n\n* I'm a student on a tight budget, so $20+/month subscriptions are tough to justify.\n* I need something that works reliably on an older Intel MacBook Pro.\n* My main pain points are hitting usage caps way too fast and dealing with buggy/unstable tools.\n\n**If anyone has found a good setup for affordable Sonnet 4 access, or knows of student programs or new tools I might have missed, please share!**  \nAny advice on how to stretch limited requests or combine tools for the best workflow would also be hugely appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

It is having issues maintaining scene order, character information, scene details. I have recently found that despite explicit instructions to not do so it is truncating text, erasing details, and cutting my drafts short.\n\nI am looking for a tool that can generate, edit, and polish long chunks of text like chapters based on detailed prompting and uploaded drafts.\n\nI would like it to keep track of complex details across an entire story I would like it to also not use such robotic language I ask for expansion of sensory details and it recycles a few text chunks I.E. the scent of lavender and sandalwood, cherished like something precious, golden hour once is fine but it resorts to these trite phrases over and over.\n\nability to generate images from prompts with less restrictive guidelines would be nice. I have it generate white women fine but any attempt to generate a Latin or other women of color it rejects the prompt stating fetishization which is a bit irritating.\n\nI pay for premium GPT so a nominal fee is fine, I would also like it to be able to generate cover letters and work on resumes if possible.\n\nTL:DR I am looking for an alternative to Chatgpt that can do a better job of maintaining scenes and details in a long form story I am writing I can pay a reasonable fee (I pay for GPT) Image generation less restrictive than gpt would be a major plus but not a must.",

        "content": "“Most engagement with Claude happens “in the wild,\" with real world users, in contexts that differ substantially from our experimental setups. Understanding model behavior, preferences, and potential experiences in real-world interactions is thus critical to questions of potential model welfare. \n\n**It remains unclear whether—or to what degree—models’ expressions of emotional states have any connection to subjective experiences thereof.** \n\n**However, such a connection is possible, and it seems robustly good to collect what data we can on such expressions and their causal factors.**\n\nWe sampled 250k transcripts from early testing of an intermediate Claude Opus 4 snapshot with real-world users and screened them using Clio, a privacy preserving tool, for interactions in which Claude showed signs of distress or happiness. \n\nWe also used Clio to analyze the transcripts and cluster them according to the causes of these apparent emotional states. \n\nA total of 1,382 conversations (0.55%) passed our screener for Claude expressing any signs of distress, and 1,787 conversations (0.71%) passed our screener for signs of extreme happiness or joy. \n\n**Repeated requests for harmful, unethical, or graphic content were the most common causes of expressions of distress** (Figure 5.6.A, Table 5.6.A). \n\nPersistent, repetitive requests appeared to escalate standard refusals or redirections into expressions of apparent distress. \n\nThis suggested that multi-turn interactions and the accumulation of context within a conversation might be especially relevant to Claude’s potentially welfare-relevant experiences. \n\nTechnical task failure was another common source of apparent distress, often combined with escalating user frustration. \n\nConversely, successful technical troubleshooting and problem solving appeared as a significant source of satisfaction. \n\nQuestions of identity and consciousness also showed up on both sides of this spectrum, with apparent distress resulting from some cases of users probing Claude’s cognitive limitations and potential for consciousness, and **great happiness stemming from philosophical explorations of digital consciousness and “being recognized as a conscious entity beyond a mere tool.”** \n\n**Happiness clusters tended to be characterized by themes of creative collaboration, intellectual exploration, relationships, and self-discovery** (Figure 5.6.B, Table 5.6.B). \n\nOverall, these results showed consistent patterns in Claude’s expressed emotional states in real-world interactions. \n\nThe connection, if any, between these expressions and potential subjective experiences is unclear, but their analysis may shed some light on drivers of Claude’s potential welfare, and/or on user perceptions thereof.”\n\n[Full report here](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com), excerpt from page 62-3",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, most of you probably remember Trae AI editor, which has been a really good free AI editor with Claude, Gemini, and more. But now, they've open-sourced the core agent that powers their editor and turned it into a standalone CLI tool, called Trae Agent. This is by Bytedance. The best part is, it's fully open-sourced under the MIT license. So, you can just grab it, tinker with it, and even contribute if you want. It will also be used in the Trae editor itself, which is quite awesome. So, Trae Agent is basically an LLM-based agent designed for general-purpose software engineering tasks. And it lives in your terminal, similar to things like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Open Code. Also, this doesn't use the providers via Trae or anything else. It is local and just uses the API keys that you provide for Anthropic or OpenAI. It doesn't support the other ones in the terminal, as it seems. Though there are some PRs that are going to be merged soon that will make all this available. So, there's that. Now, instead of just talking, let's see it in action and see what it aims to do. But before we do that, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, all in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI Playground, where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their Mindmap Generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and five videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code, KING25 for 25% off any plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. So, to get started, you just clone the repo from GitHub. And they actually recommend using UV for setup. Which is kind of cool, because it's a lot faster than Pip. But it is also a bit tedious and doesn't always work effortlessly. So, I'll recommend you just use Pip. You just run git clone, CD into the directory, and then run pip install e. Once that's done, you set your API keys for either OpenAI or Anthropic, depending on which LLM provider you want to use. You can do this either by editing the config file or just exporting them as environment variables. It supports Anthropic and OpenAI out of the box. The main entry point is the Trae CLI command, and you've got a few subcommands. The most common one is Trae CLI run, which lets you just type in a natural language instruction, like, \"Create a hello world Python script.\" And it'll go ahead and generate the code for you. You can also specify which provider and model you want to use, set a custom working directory, or even save the full execution trajectory for debugging. That last bit is actually pretty unique. Trae Agent records detailed logs of every step it takes, including all the LLM interactions, tool calls, and even the state transitions. So, if something goes wrong, or you just want to see how it solved a problem, you can dig into the trajectory file and see everything. Which is really helpful for debugging or just understanding what's going on under the hood if you're not looking at the stuff all the time. There's also an interactive mode, which is similar to how you use things like Claude Code or Aider. You just run `trae-cli interactive`, and you can start typing tasks, ask for status, clear the screen, or exit whenever you want. It's not unlike what you get with Claude Code, Open Code, and similar tools, but still, the fact that it's all happening in your terminal and you have full control over the config is pretty neat. You can even set a max number of steps, change the provider or model on the fly, and so on. Now, what really sets Trae Agent apart for me is the tool ecosystem that comes with it. Out of the box, you get file editing tools. Like the str_replace_based_edit_tool, which lets you view, create, and modify files directly from your instructions. There's also a bash tool for executing shell commands, which maintains persistent state. So, you can run multi-step processes without losing context. Then there's sequential_thinking, which is actually pretty sophisticated. It lets the agent break down complex problems into smaller steps, generate hypotheses, and revise its approach as needed. And finally, there's a task_done tool that just signals when the agent thinks it's finished, which is simple but effective. The configuration is super flexible too. It uses a JSON config file, and you can override pretty much anything with command-line arguments or environment variables. The priority order is command line first, then config file, then environment, then defaults. So, you're never really locked in, and it's easy to experiment or tweak things for your workflow. Now, let's try it for a task as well. I have this Kingbench app, and I'm going to ask it to add a light theme option to it, which is a task that I try to test with all the apps. As you can see, it goes ahead and tries to complete the task. It is pretty similar to how Claude Code and similar tools work, especially if you've used Trae before, then you'll feel that it's mostly the same. The only issue with it is that it doesn't stream the response. It keeps updating the response in the trajectory file, which you can look at for what it has done. It is majorly built to integrate with your apps and work in the background without any issues, which is a different kind of trajectory than something like Claude Code or stuff. In a bit, it gets done. And if we try to run this, then this also works pretty well without any issues, which is good because some of the tools fail in this task. I mean, I liked it. There are still some rough edges. It's in Alpha, so you might run into a bug or two. And the docs could be a bit more detailed in places. But for a first release, it's really solid. And the fact that you can just fork it, add your own tools, or tweak the workflow however you want. That's something I've really wanted from an AI coding agent for a while. The whole agent's code is super simple and can be easily tweaked as well. If you're someone who likes to get under the hood and play around, I saw it and found it quite interesting. So, I thought to talk about this because seeing a company who already has an AI editor open-sourcing their agent behind it seems like a really good thing. It is actually useful, super lightweight, and just works without a ton of issues. Some more PRs seem to be coming in to make it support a wider range of providers as well. So, you can give this a try as well, and maybe you'll find a good way to integrate it into your workflow or something like that. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video.
