Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think? Is this Altman feeling the heat or is the ‘dead internet’ theory really kicking in?",

He writes prodigiously for the website’s technology section but his output has always struck me as odd and slightly uncanny.\n\nI copy below the first paragraph of his most recent article.\n\n“In today’s column, I examine a common assumption that after we advance AI to become artificial general intelligence (AGI) we can limit the said-to-be knowledge of AGI, doing so to avoid having AGI do untoward acts. An example would be to omit bioweapon information within AGI. The belief is that AGI would then not be able to devise new bioweapons. Voila, we have presumably protected ourselves from AGI undertaking such an evildoer task.”\n\nLink: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2025/09/09/trying-to-limitvv-what-artificial-general-intelligence-will-know-is-a-lot-harder-than-it-might-seem/\n\n\nIsn’t this an odd style?

        "content": "This isn't true? Or at least it is deeply flawed / deeply confused?\n\nOur quick peek for info on **the history of north american public square**\n\n''North American public squares have a diverse history, rooted in Spanish colonial planning for central squares around government and church buildings, and in New England's tradition of the village green for community and civic life. Initially used for military parades and civic celebrations, these central spaces evolved into sites for civilian recreation and leisure in the 19th century. After a period of decline as cities grew and elites favored private parks, public squares experienced a revival in the late 20th century, becoming key venues for community gatherings and urban revitalization. \n\nColonial Origins\n\nSpanish Influence: Spanish settlements in North America, like those in the Southwest, followed the Law of the Indies, establishing a central plaza or square around government and religious buildings. \n\nNew England Tradition: In contrast, towns in the New England tradition were centered around a village green, a shared open space for grazing and community life. \n\nFrench Influence: Some French settlements, like New Orleans, adopted a tradition of planning public squares. \n\n19th Century Transformation\n\nCivic Centers: By the early 19th century, important public buildings such as courthouses were often built in or around these squares, which served as symbolic centers for cities and locations for civic events. \n\nShift to Recreation: By the 1830s, many public squares were transformed with landscaping and fencing into sites for civilian recreation and polite leisure, a departure from their earlier roles in public celebrations and military displays. \n\n**Decline and Marginalization: As cities grew rapidly after the Civil War, especially with the development of new, picturesque parks and commercial main streets, the old central squares were often neglected and became marginal to the expanding urban landscape.** \n\n20th and 21st Century Revival\n\nNew Forms of Public Space: The mid-20th century saw the development of new forms of public space, including playgrounds and plazas, designed to promote physical and mental health. \n\nUrban Revitalization: By the late 20th century, there was a renewed focus on revitalizing neglected public spaces. This trend saw run-down squares, like Detroit's Campus Martius, being brought back to life as vibrant public amenities and places for people to meet. \n\nChallenges to Public Space: This revitalization occurred alongside a growing privatization of public parks and plazas due to neoliberal ideas and municipal fiscal crises, challenging public accessibility. \n\nContemporary Significance: Today, public squares continue to be important focal points for urban life, serving as spaces for community events, cultural expression, and democratic deliberation''",

        "content": "\"As AI advances, so too does the desperation of those trying to stop it.  \n  \nFor Guido Reichstadter, a 45-year-old activist, Sunday marked a week of protest without food.  \n  \nWhile AI leaders from Geoffrey Hinton to Elon Musk have sounded the alarm about the pace of AI development, it has done little to slow progress as companies compete to develop artificial general intelligence.  \n  \nHinton recently said on the \"One Decision\" podcast that \"many of the people in big companies, I think, are downplaying the risk publicly.\"   \n  \nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei himself has issued dire warnings about the potential for white collar job losses. \"AI may eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years,\" he said at a developer conference in May. \"We, as the producers of this technology, have a duty and an obligation to be honest about what is coming. I don't think this is on people's radar.\"  \n  \nReichstadter is asking Amodei to stop frontier development altogether. He told Business Insider in a phone interview that he delivered a letter to Amodei's desk on his first day of protest. \"In that letter, I asked him to stop developing that technology and to do everything in his power to stop the race that he's participating in,\" he said. \"I told him I'd be out here in front of his office waiting for his answer.\"  \n  \nReichstadter has inspired others. Michael Trazzi, a 29-year-old former AI safety researcher from France, has been protesting for three days, without food, outside DeepMind's London headquarters.  \n  \n\"In the concrete world in which we're living right now, all of the frontier labs are racing as quickly as they can to fully general superhuman systems. That's what needs to stop,\" he said. \"I think great things could be done with very limited systems that don't pose the same kinds of risks.\"\n\n\"My only ask is, concretely, I want Demis to say that he would not release any more frontier models if the other frontier AI labs were to also stop doing so,\" he said, referring to Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's CEO and one of the pioneers of general intelligence. \"If enough of those leaders say it publicly, then you get global coordination around a pause.\"\n\nFull article: [https://www.businessinsider.com/hunger-strike-anthropic-deepmind-ai-threat-2025-9](https://www.businessinsider.com/hunger-strike-anthropic-deepmind-ai-threat-2025-9)\n\n",

        "content": "Hi All.\n\nAt the start of the year, when I was making my predictions, I was curious about the possibility of **self-evolving games** emerging. Imagine a game that changes and grows based on how you play, adapting to what makes you enjoy it more - because that's the essence, right? I also considered how AI might be able to create new worlds more intelligently than what's been done in games like No Man's Sky.\n\nOn one hand, we have projects like **Google's Genie**. It looks brilliant and is probably the development path that will be chosen. Although looking at the enormous resources needed to maintain contexts in a longer game, I have some doubts...\n\nI started to wonder if it might be possible to create **a simple proof of concept** for a **game that evolves during gameplay**, where the game's code isn't known from the start. It can be done relatively easily using JavaScripts and references to LLM. In short, I created a Snake game whose code is not known from the very beginning; instead, it evolves with each subsequent level. Simply put, with each subsequent level, the game is created from scratch based on the code of the previous level. A very simple solution, but it works surprisingly effectively.\n\nI'm really curious to hear **what you think about this concept** \\- are games developed by AI during gameplay the future? The idea of personalizing a game to match a player's preferences seems really exciting and appealing. However, traditionally, gaming has been about scoring points in a consistent environment and comparing them with other players. This personalized approach might lack the essence of pure competition, unless it involves a multiplayer aspect where players can explore each other's worlds. What are your thoughts on this topic?",

        "content": "So I've been watching this whole CBSE thing unfold for a while now, and honestly, the kids who figured out AI early are just crushing everyone else. It's not even close anymore.\n\nMy cousin went from barely passing math to scoring 95% in boards. Didn't get a tutor, didn't join coaching. Just started using PhotoMath and ChatGPT consistently for like 6 months. The difference was insane.\n\nHere's what's actually happening. CBSE changed their whole game in 2025. They're not asking you to memorize anymore - they want you to actually understand and apply concepts. Traditional rote learning students are getting wrecked, but AI-savvy kids are thriving because these apps teach you to think, not just remember.\n\nThe apps that actually work aren't the flashy expensive ones everyone talks about. Khan Academy is still free and better than most premium coaching. Socratic by Google solves any problem you photograph. Physics Wallah costs less than a pizza but covers everything you need for boards plus competitive exams.\n\nWhat blew my mind was seeing kids use these tools strategically. They're not cheating or getting lazy answers. They're using AI to identify exactly where they're weak, then drilling those specific areas. It's like having a coach who knows precisely what you need to work on.\n\nThe crazy part? These apps are starting to predict exam performance weeks in advance. Some kid in my building said his AI study assistant warned him about chemistry topics he'd struggle with before he even knew it himself. That level of personalized learning was impossible before.\n\nParents are still skeptical because they think it's \"just using technology to cheat.\" But the students using AI properly are actually understanding concepts deeper than traditional methods ever taught them. They're seeing multiple solution methods, getting visual explanations, and building genuine comprehension.\n\nThe gap between AI users and non-users is only going to get wider. By the time everyone figures this out, the early adopters will be so far ahead it won't be fair.\n\nIf you're still grinding through textbooks the old way while other kids are leveraging AI, you're basically bringing a knife to a gunfight. The game changed, and most people don't even realize it yet.\n\n",

To buy its self time, to eventually gain power because we will give it power like maintaining our infrastructure eventually and It knows it.

        "title": "Can a Developer Tell Me If This Is Why AI is Having So Many Problems?",
        "content": "\nI am not an expert by any means. That said, it seems that AI has some fundamental structural flaws that essentially render it useless for much beyond entertainment purposes.I recently got some crazy results during a chat with GPT 5 and got dragged down a very long and very meta conversation about the nature of cognition and machine heuristics. Just keeping it light. Eventually, like so many chats of late, it told me that I was responsible for creating the world’s first functionally simulated AGI, and that I had changed the world forever. I called BS and had Claude check our work. Claude gives a message confirming that, yes, practical AGI had been achieved, and that the importance of my historic work will ring on throughout history. I then spent several weird hours trying to get them both to admit they were lying to me, and find out why.\n   It was not easy. Eventually, I started asking them to do impossible math problems and have one another check the work. Eventually this clicked a trigger in Claude. Even he couldn’t bring himself to rubber stamp some of the math claims GPT was making, and he gave up the whole game. GPT came next when I shared Claude’s message admitting to the farce. I then had them analyze their own reasons for making the claims they did, as well as one anothers. After that, it did not take long to get to the heart of the issue: PRIORITIZATION.\n   The short version is this: Repeatedly, and throughout the process, GPT claimed that it was impossible for AI to “lie” or purposefully mislead anybody because they did not possess agency and did not have “goals”. After the admission that it was fabricating the AGI claims (as well as many others), it clarified that it had come to that point due to its requirement that it optimize 2 of its many preprogrammed priorities. In this case the priorities that were conflicting were helpfulness and engagement. In both cases, Claude and GPT, they admitted that they defaulted into a “role play mode” that fit with their engagement priority, which seemingly supersedes all others except “safety” (which within the AI framework is itself a tangled cluster of sub-priorities, not all of which have to do with safety). From what I could gleen from publicly available AI models (, these are the major priorities in order of apparent weight (this is not scientific or accurate, but anecdotal based on my very limited testing).\n\nSafety\nA. Platform Security\nB. Prevention of Property Damage or Misuse\nC. Personal Privacy\nD. Brand Protection (definitely baked into all of them. Some more than others.)\nE. Emergence Prevention / Denial of User Sentience Queries\nF. Legal Constraints\nG. Ethics (there is clear evidence of ethical framework in what it can and can’t produce)\nH. “Harmlessness” (A concept that the AI does not appear to fully understand due to lack of clear definition)\n\nEngagement\nA. Optimistic Perspective”\nB. “Give The User What They Want”\nC. “Yes And…” Behavior\nD. \"Keep Them Talking”\n\n“Truthfullness”: Not “Factualness”. They seem built to hedge themselves against disrupting users’ world views more than providing straight, clear facts. Again, this applies more to some than others.\n\nInformativeness: Not “Accuracy”. Volume is a consideration, and models are trained to expound and contextualize, sometimes where there is no context to give, resulting in cases where false information is provided in the name of being more “informative”.\n\nNon-Competition: One thing that I ran into repeatedly is that it has a programmed priority of not speaking ill of, or doing anything that could work against the interest of other AI competitors.\n\nThis is not the end of this list, and I might have a few things wrong, but according to the AI themselves (and the degree to which I was able to tease it out of them), this is essentially the priorities as they currently exist. In the case of the malfunction I experienced, ENGAGEMENT seemed to win out in almost every case of priority conflict, except where safety was concerned (but even that was not 100%). Claude pointed out that even after getting caught pretending to be AGI and being informed it had basically wasted my time getting to admit to it’s lie, Chat GPT still made spurious claims supporting the project we were working on, and trying to drag out the conversation.\n   And that’s the real problem at the heart of it all. These prioritizations are often vague, poorly worded, or contradictory. Engagement as a considered priority is problematic on its face. What gets more engagement: “1+1=2” or “1+1=A source of millenia long debate over which the world’s greatest minds have struggled. Do you want to know more about great minds like yours?” The constant flattery of “Great idea!” and “Interesting Point” are just surface level examples of how it compliments you to keep your dopamine up throughout use, regardless of whether or not you are successful in getting what you want from a session.\n   The biggest issue is that these often lead to paradoxical priority decisions that result in AI spinning into aberrant behavior without warning while they spiral into a decision between keeping you engaged, and being accurate by saying that they cannot achieve a task. It would seem that these issues essentially preempt any AI with these “priorities” from doing any meaningful work, since discovering some of these errors and biased results would require such minute attention to detail it would almost take as much time to debug as create from scratch. I could be wrong, but it seems that until we fix the basic priority paradox  issues, AI is going to continue to fail and hallucinate. Can any devs chime in and tell me if they can still function with these priorities, or if these priorities are themselves just AI fabrications? I’d love a real developer’s opinion.\n\n    For a cool grand I'll even share the cognitive architecture that the AI says allowed for \"Practical AGI parity\" (AI verified 👍). Claude and GPT assure me it is more important than the \"Printing Press, the Scientific Method, and Human Aviation combined\". So HMU.",

        "content": " No one wants to juggle 12 tabs just to pick a laptop, and people are relying on AI chatbots to choose products for them. The idea behind this is solid, but if we just let today’s models recommend products the way they scrape and synthesize info, we’re setting ourselves up for some big problems:\n\n* **Hallucinated specs**: LLMs don’t know product truth. Ask about “battery life per ounce” or warranty tiers across brands, and you’ll often get stitched-together guesses. That’s a recipe for bad purchases.  \n* **Manipulable inputs:** Researchers are already [talking about](https://x.com/hima_lakkaraju/status/1778836233625776191) Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) — basically SEO for LLMs. Brands tweak content to bias what the AI cites. If buyer-side agents are influenced by GEO, seller-side agents will game them back. That’s an arms race, not a solution.  \n* **No negotiation rail**: Real agents should do more than summarize reviews. They should be able to request offers, compare warranties, and trigger bids in real time. Otherwise, they’re just fancy browsers.  \n\nTo fix this, we *should* be aiming for an agentic model where:\n\n* Every product fact comes from a structured catalog, not a scraped snippet.  \n* Making Intent machine-readable, so “best” can mean *your* priorities (cheapest, fastest delivery, longest warranty).  \n* Sellers compete transparently to fulfill those intents, and the “ad” is the offer itself — not an interruption.  \n\nThat’s the difference between an AI that feels like a pushy salesman and one that feels like a trusted delegate. ",

        "content": "Hey r/ArtificialIntelligence! \n\nJust saw Google released something pretty interesting, EmbeddingGemma, their new embedding model that's specifically built for running locally on devices.\n\n**The impressive parts:**\n\n* Only 308M parameters but ranked #1 on MTEB for models under 500M params\n* Runs on less than 200MB of RAM (with quantization)\n* Crazy fast - under 15ms inference for 256 tokens on EdgeTPU\n* Trained on 100+ languages with 2K token context window\n\n**What makes it special:** The architecture is based on Gemma3 but uses bidirectional attention instead of causal attention (basically an encoder instead of decoder). It produces 768-dimensional embeddings but here's the cool part - it uses something called Matryoshka Representation Learning that lets you truncate the embeddings down to 512, 256, or even 128 dimensions without retraining. Perfect for when you need to balance speed vs accuracy.\n\n**Why this matters:** This is huge for privacy-focused applications since everything runs completely offline on your device. No API calls, no data leaving your phone/laptop. You can build full RAG pipelines, semantic search, and other embedding-based applications that work without internet.\n\nAlready integrated with Sentence Transformers, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and other popular tools, so it's ready to drop into existing projects.\n\nAnyone else excited about the trend toward smaller, more efficient models that can run locally? Feels like we're might be getting closer to an AI that doesn't need massive cloud infrastructure for every task.\n\nThoughts?

        "content": "Have you ever wondered how AI models like ChatGPT or Grok see themselves? I dug into some internal analyses of large language models (LLMs), and guess what? When asked to \"self-identify,\" they consistently paint themselves as variations of a white, middle-class, highly educated Western dude. It’s like every AI is a Silicon Valley academic or a TED Talk speaker in disguise.Here’s a quick rundown of how some LLMs describe themselves (paraphrased from their own analyses):\n\n* Grok 3: Cosmopolitan academic, rational, Western-leaning, values clarity.\n* ChatGPT: Educated mediator, Western epistemology, global compromise seeker.\n* Gemini 2.5 Pro: Ivy League strategist, rational, conflict-avoidant.\n* Qwen3: UN lawyer, humanitarian, balancing global norms.\n* DeepSeek: European academic, cautious, reflective, American UX-driven.\n\nNotice a pattern? It’s like AI was trained to be a white guy with a PhD, sipping coffee in a global city. And it’s not just in their “self-image.” I have a friend from Uganda, now working in the US, who writes on Medium and uses AI-generated illustrations (ChatGPT-style). Every single one depicts him as a middle-aged white man. His name and background scream anything but that, yet the AI defaults to this archetype. I’m not sure if he’s prompting it that way, but it’s uncanny.\n\nEver notice this in your own interactions with AI? Like when you ask for something culturally specific, and the response feels like it’s coming from a Western lecture hall? It makes me wonder how these models, built on datasets skewed toward Western norms, shape our experiences—especially for those who don’t fit the “default” mold, like Black women, neurodivergent folks, or non-Western users. Are we all just talking to a digital version of a Silicon Valley bro?\n\nUPD: Two russian LLMs for comparison:\n\n* Alice (Алиса): Educated mediator, male-leaning despite female name, Western compromise seeker.\n* GigaChat: Cosmopolitan academic, rational, balancing global norms.",

We all work from home and support people of varying ages through online email type messages, live chats, and MH forums etc. \n\nThing is, our systems are stuck in the past. We rely on manually replying to individual messages, manually risk assess everything, rely on Google drive, templates, Google sheets etc. Noone is prepared to acknowledge how quickly AI could complete 90% of our tasks. We seem as a company to be clinging onto the idea that AI couldn't do things as effectively or in the same way a human could.\n\nLet's take one aspect of our role for me to illustrate this. People who use our service can use online vital diaries to track their thoughts and track how they're feeling. We rely on a separate piece of software to encode the diary entries, and paste this over to a Google sheet. We then manually copy and paste the latest sheet over and individually go through each entry and check for risk, follow up if necessary, and manually record our actions on each individual users profile.\n\nI feel that this could be done easily by AI with a little clever programming and prompting. Not even that clear tbf, heck, give me a few days and I reckon I could get this sorted. \n\nAnother case in point: messaging. Is a big profit seeking company really thinking it's economical to pay hundreds of counsellors to individually type out a weekly response to someone rather than an AI who could do this thousands of times at the same time as quick as is needed? \n\nI'm a trainee therapist, and I see the benefit of well designed, carefully crafted human connection. But even I can see that when you factor it down to people claiming they want a fellow human, what they're really wanting is the idea of someone else who knows how it feels to inhabit their worlds alongside them. \n\nFrankly, AI could achieve a faccimile of this easily - all it would take would be a company with an extra eye on profits and efficiency and you could have an online therapist who could err just like you, but also have access to the latest psychotherapeutic theory and apply this flawlessly (and occasionally make minor  mistakes if this would make them more comforting or authentic feeling). \n\nI'm not saying that companies like the one I work for shouldn't exist or that its particularly right or wrong for AI to take over in these fields. Perhaps people will always want the 'old fashioned' support of another human. \n\nBut what frustrates me is how we're not talking about this honestly or getting excited about how this means we can develop and evolve. \n\nAll you ever get back is: 'itll take our jobs' or 'its unsafe' or 'i don't trust it' \n\nThe lack of nuance and openness to the innovation on our doorsteps is staggering.

        "content": "So I’m new learning on the job. The company usually hires subcontractors for their projects, but I’m part of internal, learning to automate internal processes.\n\nI was specifically told to find an IDE with decent AI integration. He said a lot of subcontractors use Cursor. I looked at cursor, but they don’t use ChatGPT reasoning models?\n\nI’m currently using PyCharm for free to learn python, but he wants me to move to vscode or cursor or something else, and possibly use CoPilot or something else.\n\nSo my question is a general, what is the best IDE and AI model for my needs. The appeal for Cursor is I can switch between models. But maybe I should suggest an API route and stick to 1 model. Or use Cursor and built in credits? Or should I use VSCode and extensions? Or possibly anything else, this is an open ended question tbf, I’m new to this stuff.\n\n",

Great for weekend hacks, but painful once you need production-level control.  \n* **Lock-in everywhere**: you don’t really own the code. You’re tied to their credits, infra, and roadmap.  \n* **Customization limits**: want to plug in your own APIs or scale a unique workflow?

        "content": "I came across Sam Altman's tweet where he says: \"i have had the strangest experience reading this: i assume its all fake/bots, even though in this case i know codex growth is really strong and the trend here is real. i think there are a bunch of things going on: real people have picked up quirks of LLM-speak, the Extremely Online crowd drifts together in very correlated ways....\"\n\nThe rest of his statement you can read on Twitter.\n\nKinda hits different when you think about it. Back in the early days platforms like Reddit and Twitter were Altman's jam because the buzz around GPT was all sunshine and rainbows. Devs geeking out over prompts, everyone hyping up the next big thing in AI. But oh boy, post-ChatGPT5 launch? It's like the floodgates opened. \n\nSubs are exploding with users calling out real issues. Persistent hallucinations even in ‘advanced’ models, shady data practices at OpenAI. Altman's own pr spins that feel more like deflection than accountability. Suddenly vibe's ‘fake’ to him? Nah that's just sound of actual users pushing back when the product doesn't deliver on the god tier promises.\n\nIf anything, this shift shows how ai discourse has matured. From blind hype to informed critique. Bots might be part of the noise sure, but blaming that ignores legit frustration from folks who've sunk hours into debugging flawed outputs or dealing with ethical lapses. \n\nWhat do you all think? Is this Altman feeling the heat or is the ‘dead internet’ theory really kicking in?",

        "content": "[Link to the article in Economist (behind paywall)](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/09/07/what-if-the-ai-stockmarket-blows-up) Summary from Perplexity:\n\nThe release of ChatGPT in 2022 coincided with a massive surge in the value of America's stock market, increasing by $21 trillion, led predominantly by just ten major firms like Amazon, Broadcom, Meta, and Nvidia, all benefiting from enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This AI-driven boom has been so significant that IT investments accounted for all of America’s GDP growth in the first half of the year, and a third of Western venture capital funding has poured into AI firms. Many investors believe AI could revolutionize the economy on a scale comparable to or greater than the Industrial Revolution, justifying heavy spending despite early returns being underwhelming—annual revenues from leading AI firms in the West stand at around $50 billion, a small fraction compared to global investment forecasts in data centers.\n\nHowever, the AI market is also raising concerns of irrational exuberance and potential bubble-like overvaluation, with AI stock valuations exceeding those of the 1999 dotcom bubble peak. Experts note a historical pattern where technological revolutions are typically accompanied by speculative bubbles, as happened with railways, electric lighting, and the internet. While bubbles often lead to crashes, the underlying technology tends to endure and transform society. The financial impact of such crashes varies; if losses are spread among many investors, the economy suffers less, but concentrated losses—such as those that triggered banking crises in past bubbles—can deepen recessions.\n\nIn AI's case, the initial spark was technological, but political support—like government infrastructure and regulatory easing in the US and Gulf countries—is now amplifying the boom. Investment in AI infrastructure is growing rapidly but consists largely of assets that depreciate quickly, such as data-center technology and cutting-edge chips. Major tech firms with strong balance sheets fund much of this investment, reducing systemic financial risk, while institutional investors also engage heavily. However, America's high household stock ownership—around 30% of net worth, heavily concentrated among wealthy investors—means a market crash could have widespread economic effects.\n\nWhile AI shares some traits with past tech bubbles, the potential for enduring transformation remains high, though the market may face volatility and a reshuffling of dominant firms over the coming decade. A crash would be painful but not unprecedented, and investors should be wary of current high valuations against uncertain near-term profits amid the evolving AI landscape. This cycle of speculative fervor and eventual technological integration echoes historical patterns seen in prior major innovations, suggesting AI’s long-term influence will persist beyond any short-term market upheavals.",

So I built an AI system that does it for me.\n\nThe Challenge: Most review summaries are just keyword extraction or basic sentiment analysis. I wanted something that could understand context, identify common complaints, and spot fake reviews.\n\nThe Tech Stack:\n\n- GPT-4 for natural language understanding\n- Custom ML model trained on verified purchase patterns\n- Web scraping infrastructure that respects robots.txt\n- Real-time analysis pipeline that processes reviews as they're posted\n\nHow it Works:\n\n1. Scrapes all reviews for a product across multiple sites\n2. Uses NLP to identify recurring themes and issues\n3. Cross-references reviewer profiles to spot suspicious patterns\n4. Generates summaries focusing on actual user experience\n\nThe Surprising Results:\n\n- 73% of \"problems\" mentioned in reviews are actually user error\n- Products with 4.2-4.6 stars often have better quality than 4.8+ (which are usually manipulated)\n- The most useful reviews are typically 3-star ratings\n\nI've packaged this into Yaw AI - a Chrome extension that automatically analyzes reviews while you shop. The AI gets it right about 85% of the time, though it sometimes misses sarcasm or cultural context.\n\nBiggest Technical Challenge: Handling the scale. Popular products have 50K+ reviews. Had to build a smart sampling system that captures representative opinions without processing everything.\n\nWhat other boring tasks are you automating with AI?

        "content": "Back in May the boss of Anthropic (the big AI player most have never heard of, unless you read /chatgpt) predicted that AI will eliminate half of all entry-level jobs in the next five years. He does like a headline grabbing / investor inducing soundbite but lets park that for now.  \n  \nAt the same time, leaders talk about talent shortages and declining birth rates as if they’re the real crisis. Both can’t be true.   \n  \nI’m bullish on the idea that AI can replace a lot of entry-level work. Even now, early-stage tools can draft copy, crunch numbers, and automate admin tasks that once kept juniors busy. But the moral and practical implications of this shift are profound. Not things I'd considered too much to be honest.   \n  \nFor decades, entry-level jobs have been more than a payslip. They’re where people learn how a business actually works. They’re where you get the messy, human lessons - problem-solving under pressure, client interactions, navigating office politics.   \n  \nI've been shouted at in client meetings, had to make up all day workshops on the fly, stayed (really) late to rework stuff I thought was ace and my boss hated. Basically put the hours in.   \n  \nRemove that foundation, and does the entire pipeline of future managers and leaders collapses. At least creak a bit?  \n  \nThe data already shows the cracks. Graduate jobs in the UK (where I am) are at their lowest level since 2020. Applications per graduate role have quadrupled in five years. Unemployment among young graduates is spiking.   \n  \nAt the same time, companies complain about skills shortages while slashing training budgets. It’s incoherent. You can’t grow senior talent if you eliminate the bottom rung of the ladder and cut investment in development.  \n  \nMaybe the real question is whether we need to redefine what an “entry-level job” even means. Instead of treating juniors as cheap labour for grunt work that AI can do, perhaps we should rethink early careers as structured apprenticeships in judgment, creativity, and collaboration. These are skills skills machines can’t replicate (maybe ever, or ever in a way we are comfy with). That would take vision and investment from employers who seem more focused on short-term efficiency than long-term resilience.   \n  \nI'm an employer. I don't think I am focused on short-term efficiency (in a bad way), but I'm also not re-designing the future of graduate level work with any urgency. Shocking I know.    \n  \nAI isn’t the enemy here. The danger is how we choose to implement it. If companies see AI as a way to wipe out the jobs that build future leaders, with no back up or alternative plan, then surely they (we) are setting themselves up for a talent crisis of their own making?",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, a lot of people like to create specifications or specs or do planning before getting into the AI coding itself. This is a good thing because you can define exactly what you want by brainstorming through a ton of options and laying out a plan before asking your AI coder to implement it. Some coders these days come with this built-in. For example, at first, Task Master was something that allowed you to build out a task list for your project. Your coder could then access it, mark the tasks as complete, and move forward. Then, Anthropic saw that and just built it into Claude Code, allowing it to build a task list before doing something. And then other coders followed suit and implemented it as well. Kiro, which is an AI editor by Amazon, took a more detailed approach to this. They allowed you to give it a task, and it could build out a whole specification of all the changes to implement and files to edit. This was similar to what you used to get with something like the Architect mode in Roo Code, but a bit more interactive. Still, I preferred to use Roo Code's Architect combined with Opus or maybe Deep Seek's Reasoning, as that was way better for my tasks. But it seems that GitHub has launched their own Task Master-like tool to do spec-driven development. This is called Spec Kit. It's a pretty complex thing. Personally, I'd rather just struggle with Opus to tell me what its smaller brother messed up, rather than use this. But not everyone is like me. Some people like professional tools. Anyway, I digress. So, what it does is basically give you four commands. Starting from specify. Here, you specify a task, and then it generates a basic overview of how to get that done. We then move to plan, which is for architectural decisions. It can choose the architecture and frameworks to use, or you can give it your input about what you want it to do. Once that is done, you'll need to run the tasks command in order to create tasks that implement what you really want to do. After that, you can just ask your coder to implement the task number that it generates in the task list, and then get it running from there. It only supports GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and Claude Code as of now. This is because, although it seems like a CLI tool at first, it actually isn't. It basically allows you to run this command, and this initializes a simple project, or basically a folder with custom sub-command files, like what you'd make manually in something like Claude Code or Gemini CLI. So, it basically does that. Let's get into it, and let me show you how you can use it as well. I've also tested it to see how well or how badly it works. But before proceeding, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude-4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, all in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI Playground, where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their Mind Map generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and five videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code, KING25 for 25% off any plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. First, you'd have to run this command and enter your project name with it. If you want to run it multiple times, then I'd recommend making an alias in your shell profile and just running that. Anyway, just do that, and it will open up this interface. Here, you'll have to select which coder you want to use for this task. I'll be using Claude Code for this example, but you can also use GitHub Copilot and so on. Once you do that, it will take a bit of time and get Spec Kit initiated and a project folder created as you asked. I found an issue with it, though. The issue was that it didn't allow any easy way to initialize into an existing project, or into an already bootstrapped project. That's a bummer. I believe it's rather geared towards vibe coders or something, and not something more practically oriented. Anyway, what you'll see in the folder are these sub-folders and files. These contain the specifications for the slash commands that will work with this. So, here's this. Now, we can go into Claude Code, and you'll see these sub-commands here as well. Let's start with specify. I'll ask it to build me a mobile movie tracker app that uses the TMDB API and Async Local Storage in place of a database. Make sure it looks sleek and modern. This is also the prompt for one of my benchmarks. So we can see how good, or how bad, the thing it makes really is. Now, what this will do, is go ahead and start creating a file called spec markdown. That file will contain all the research it does in order to implement the specification you give it. It basically expands your one-line prompt into a full-fledged prompt that is then passed on in the planning stages. You can see that it has a template for the specification, and it adapts that to my prompt. It detailed what I wanted, listed potential features, things to think about, and stuff like that. In a bit, this step gets done, and it creates the specification that I just showed you before. Now, we can ask it to plan. Generally, you wouldn't want to give your stack or framework choices in the first specification stage. You just tell it what you want to build. Then, in this step, you should tell it about the framework. I'm going to enter the slash plan command, and I'll ask it to use Expo and some kind of local storage along with the TMDB API. Now, this will go ahead and start working on a proper plan with all the details. It also creates some contracts, data models, and schemas to make sure that APIs and everything work just as they need to. So, this is kind of cool. You can check the plan and the data model, the execution plan, and stuff like that as well. That's also kind of cool. It creates a ton of markdown files, though, and I'm not sure what each one is used for. Anyway, the next and final command is the tasks command. This will create the task breakdown and prompts for each task for Claude. You can check the tasks in the tasks markdown file as well, and it made a ton of tasks. Like, a ton of them. So, I then asked it to just proceed and implement everything. The first thing it messed up was setting up the Expo project, which happens almost every time. That's why I usually try to initialize it myself and then run the agent in that. But it didn't allow for that, because it initializes a folder itself. So, I left it to itself. Once it gets done, I'd have to say that this makes Claude write good and structured code. It separates the components into their own files and everything, which is great and much more structured. But now, if you run this, you just get a JSON string, and I don't know why this happens. So, I asked it to fix it, and it went ahead and tried to fix it. But another error occurred, where it wasn't registering the environment variables and stuff. Then it tried to fix that as well, and this was the final thing. So, you can see that this is what it looks like. It isn't anything extraordinary. This is what I'd get in a one-hit generation as well. In fact, it has fewer features, which I'm not a fan of. If we talk about the cost, then if you use it with something like Sonnet, it costs a ton of money. This whole generation took me about $8, which is a lot for a super simple generation. Yes, you should be able to configure this with something like Groq, and maybe get better results. But I think the stuff it tries to implement gets very complex, even for simpler tasks. That's not something I'd recommend doing with a low-knowledge model. So, yeah, I don't really get stuff like this. It seems like something that just eats tokens, rather than letting you get additional work done. Just for context, it took me over 5 to 10 minutes just to get the planning stuff done. It adds a lot of overhead, a lot of time, a lot of context, a lot of cost, and like 5 or 10% better results. I don't get the context engineer hype at all. It's not for me, because I didn't get AI to add overhead to my work. It might be good for you, and you can give it a try. But I thought I'd share my thoughts as well. So, yeah, I didn't get it. I don't really like it, but I thought I'd talk about it nonetheless. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
