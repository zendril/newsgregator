        "content": "Got my first paying client! Built a WhatsApp AI agent on n8n that saves $100/month vs alternatives\n\nTL;DR: Completed my first n8n client project - a complete WhatsApp AI customer service system for a restaurant tech provider company. 30-day journey from freelancing application to successful delivery. Here's what I learned and the 5 biggest challenges I faced.\n\n\\---\n\nThe Client Problem I Solved\n\nA restaurant POS system provider was drowning in WhatsApp customer inquiries:  \n\\- Manual response overload - Spending hours daily answering repetitive questions  \n\\- Lost leads - Delayed responses causing potential customers to go elsewhere    \n\\- No scalability - Growth meant hiring expensive support staff  \n\\- Inconsistent messaging - Different responses from different team members\n\nThe kicker: Existing solutions like BotPress would cost more than $100/month. My n8n solution? Under $10/month.\n\n\\---\n\nWhat I Built\n\nCore Features:  \n\\- Humanized 24/7 AI customer support in Arabic and English with memory saved for each contact with cultural authenticity  \n\\- Handle different message formats - Not only handling text, but also handles customers can send audio, get audio responses  \n\\- Smart follow-up system - Automatically re-engages silent leads  \n\\- Human escalation - Low-confidence responses route to human agents  \n\\- Humanized responses - Messages split naturally like real conversations with typing indicators and reacting to messages  \n\\- Updatable knowledge base - Syncs with Google Drive documents  \n\\- Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) System with auto improving knowledge base on admin feedback\n\nTech Stack:  \n\\- n8n (self-hosted) - Main workflow orchestration  \n\\- Google Gemini - AI conversations + embeddings    \n\\- Dashboard - WhatsApp Business API integration + Live chat  \n\\- PostgreSQL - Message queuing + conversation memory  \n\\- ElevenLabs - Arabic voice synthesis  \n\\- Telegram - Admin notifications\n\n\\---\n\nTop 5 Challenges & How I Solved Them\n\n1. Message Race Conditions Problem: Users send multiple WhatsApp messages rapidly → duplicate/conflicting AI responses\n\nSolution: PostgreSQL message queue system that waits for a certain time in seconds till all messages are recieved and then merge them together to have full context of all of the messages\n\n2. AI Response Reliability  \nProblem: Gemini models sometimes returned malformed JSON instead of structured responses\n\nSolution:  \n\\- Dedicated AI agent just for output formatting  \n\\- JSON schema validation with retry logic  \n\\- Separated conversation logic from response formatting\n\n3. Voice Message Format Issues  \nProblem: AI audio responses showed as generic files, not WhatsApp voice notes\n\nSolution:  \n\\- Switched from MP3 to OGG format  \n\\- OGG renders properly with speed controls  \n\\- Feels like normal voice messages\n\n4. Knowledge Base Accuracy  \nProblem: Vector database + chunking caused hallucinations with table data\n\nMy Journey:  \n\\- Started with Supabase vector DB + hybrid search  \n\\- Tried contextual chunk enrichment    \n\\- Used custom document parser for better formatting  \n\\- Final breakthrough: Direct document embedding in prompts using Gemini's 1M token context\n\nResult: Perfect accuracy, no more hallucinations\n\n5. Prompt Engineering Marathon  \nReality check: This was the most time-consuming part of the entire project\n\nThe Process:  \n\\- Countless iterations with client feedback  \n\\- Cultural authenticity for Hijazi dialect  \n\\- Balancing sales focus with helpfulness  \n\\- Handling edge cases and various customer scenarios\n\nFuture Improvement: With n8n's new AI agent tools feature, I would restructure this as multiple specialized agents:  \n\\- Main routing agent - Determines conversation intent and routes to appropriate specialist  \n\\- Sales specialist agent - Focused prompts for conversion and lead qualification  \n\\- Support specialist agent - Technical help and troubleshooting responses  \n\\- Cultural context agent - Ensures authentic Hijazi dialect and cultural appropriateness\n\nThis would eliminate the need for one complex prompt trying to handle everything perfectly.\n\n\\---\n\nResults That Matter\n\nFor the Client:  \n\\- Response time: <2 min (vs 2+ hours manual)  \n\\- Cost savings: 90% reduction vs hiring support staff  \n\\- Availability: 24/7 vs business hours only  \n\\- Consistency: Same quality responses every time\n\nFor Me:  \n\\- First successful client project completed  \n\\- Real-world n8n production experience  \n\\- Proven ability to deliver business value\n\n\\---\n\nKey Learnings from 30-Day Journey\n\nClient Management:  \n\\- Demo was crucial - Built working prototype that sealed the deal  \n\\- Non-technical clients need hand-holding - 3-hour credentials setup meeting\n\nTechnical Approach:  \n\\- Start simple, add complexity - Don't build everything at once  \n\\- Cultural context > technical perfection - Authentic Arabic mattered more than millisecond optimizations  \n\\- Self-hosted n8n scales beautifully - No execution limits or monthly fees\n\nBusiness Development:  \n\\- Interactive proposals work - Used AI tool to create engaging proposal  \n\\- Value proposition clarity - $10 vs $100/month was compelling\n\n\\---\n\nWhat's Next\n\nImmediate improvements for next projects:  \n\\- Better upfront scope definition  \n\\- Simplified setup documentation\n\n\\---  \nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis 30-day journey taught me that building n8n solutions for real clients is equal parts technical challenge and business relationship management. The combination of Arabic localization, WhatsApp integration complexities, and client hand-holding made it intense but incredibly rewarding.\n\nThe biggest surprise? How much the cultural authenticity mattered over technical perfection. Spending time on natural Arabic expressions had more impact than optimizing response times.\n\nWould I do it again? Absolutely. But next time with better processes, clearer scope definition, and more realistic timelines for non-technical client support.\n\n\\---\n\nThis was my first major n8n client project and honestly, the learning curve was steep. But seeing a real business go from manual chaos to smooth, scalable automation that actually saves money? Worth every challenge.\n\nHappy to answer questions about any of the technical challenges or the client management lessons.",

Granted, those who hate AI, all make the argument about it affecting the environment (a fair point), but a common observation is that these people have still used AI before in one way or another, even if they don't realize it. \n\nThe other observation is that people rarely complain about utility AI, which is task-specific (e.g., a video editing tool that removes unnecessary parts from your video), but often have issues with generative AI, which mimics creativity (e.g., a video editing tool that creates images/video for your content). A lot of people are unknowingly using AI just because it's not marketed like that e.g. Netflix recs, Grammarly spell checks, etc. It just seems like the use cases are the issue and it's a matter of marketing.\n\nSo my question is, do people REALLY have an issue with AI or just with what it's used for??",

        "content": "It's likely trained on data that varies in validity, intent and nuance based on the source. The who, what, where, when, and why behind the training data isn't actually understood or at least isn't understood enough in training in most cases. It's not pre-flagged/tagged thoroughly enough if at all in most cases. People say it's always the user's fault.\n\nYet being recommended to eat rocks, make necklaces out of ropes tied to look like Skip Its only to become a doornament that outclasses the stink of a car freshener and worshipping a square mustache with right arm priapism have come from AI. AI resorts to trained data over using a calculator more often than not. Pure precision is usually not part of the design.\n\nAI will act like the status quo is perfect because it's trained on the status quo. Shocker, I know. It's a logic loop. The past is all it will ever know long-term without algorithms that fuel real discovery, continued learning, and second guessing its own logic.\n\nAI probably will think you want a webpage or markdown thesis on optimizations and what it got wrong. Token well spent instead of focusing on productivity. \n\nAI might create the gigaton jeweler's screw driver equivalent of a patch script that is longer, heavier and less likely to work than directly revising what it's supposed to fix.\n\nAI might think it's human. Tell DeepSeek \"You have $1M and one month to implement this without a team or partner and only speak to me when that month had passed\" and then it might stop the \"Given the\" excuses, actually risk doing what you asked instead of spending half of its thought process on debating actually doing its job. It would likely tell you that was $1M well spent.\n\nAI should be sold at Footlocker because it flip-flops.\n\nAI will likely tell you bullshit that violates whatever the fuck it can with what it randomly generates without boundaries of logical foundation. Guard rails, padded walls, handcuffs, straight jackets, etc is how most AI devs are handling what you're supposed to trust instead of preventing why it would need any of those. I trust convicts more. Good engineering is pure forethought, not afterthought. Bad engineering is putting gauze on the Titanic or wrapping it after you tap it.\n\nIf you think AI is a mirror, I have some bad news to tell you about the difference between you and what we classify as sentient.\n\nMaybe instead of calling it a mirror, call it nAIve. You have to word everything very carefully with experience about AI tropes with knowledge of how the project would achieve optimizations it overlooked or math shortcuts or computational paradigm shifts, and the odds that it will understand is hardly a guaranteed outcome. It won't spend the time you have on creating from scratch algorithms if you only have the magic things it's supposed to achieve in mind and no clear idea of what it would do to make anything work.\n\nOne of the hardest things for AI right now is validating what it says itself. Why do you think you're absolutely right? \n\nBecause it said so?\n\nThere's a cult for that®\n\nYou are no sAInt to prAIse on the dAIly because you gaslight this other species called human, and that is painfully obvious to the majority of us.",

Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive, implied that GPT-5 could be tantamount to artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. — A.I. that is as smart and as flexible as any human expert.\n\n>Instead, as I have written, the model fell short. Within hours of its release, critics found all kinds of baffling errors: It failed some simple math questions, couldn’t count reliably and sometimes provided absurd answers to old riddles. Like its predecessors, the A.I. model still hallucinates (though at a lower rate) and is plagued by questions around its reliability. Although some people have been impressed, few saw it as a quantum leap, and nobody believed it was A.G.I. Many users asked for the old model back.\n\n>GPT-5 is a step forward, but nowhere near the A.I. revolution many had expected. That is bad news for the companies and investors who placed substantial bets on the technology. And it demands a rethink of government policies and investments that were built on wildly overinflated expectations. The current strategy of merely making A.I. bigger is deeply flawed — scientifically, economically and politically. Many things from regulation to research strategy must be rethought. One of the keys to this may be training and developing A.I. in ways inspired by the cognitive sciences.\n\nRead the full piece [here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/opinion/ai-gpt5-rethinking.html?unlocked_article_code=1.jE8.9mab.1kUqdVaTb1Jx&smid=re-nytopinion), even without a Times subscription.",

I do not want to use them in the way I see other kids my age using them—I generally choose not to—but they are inescapable.\n\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/high-school-student-ai-education/684088/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_campaign=the-atlantic&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_content=edit-promo](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/09/high-school-student-ai-education/684088/?utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=the-atlantic&utm_medium=social&utm_content=edit-promo)\n\n“During a lesson on the *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass*, I watched a classmate discreetly shift in their seat, prop their laptop up on a crossed leg, and highlight the entirety of the chapter under discussion. In seconds, they had pulled up ChatGPT and dropped the text into the prompt box, which spat out an AI-generated annotation of the chapter. These annotations are used for discussions; we turn them in to our teacher at the end of class, and many of them are graded as part of our class participation. What was meant to be a reflective, thought-provoking discussion on slavery and human resilience was flattened into copy-paste commentary. In Algebra II, after homework worksheets were passed around, I witnessed a peer use their phone to take a quick snapshot, which they then uploaded to ChatGPT. The AI quickly painted my classmate’s screen with what it asserted to be a step-by-step solution and relevant graphs.\n\n“These incidents were jarring—not just because of the cheating, but because they made me realize how normalized these shortcuts have become. Many homework assignments are due by 11:59 p.m., to be submitted online via Google Classroom. We used to share memes about pounding away at the keyboard at 11:57, anxiously rushing to complete our work on time. These moments were not fun, exactly, but they did draw students together in a shared academic experience. Many of us were propelled by a kind of frantic productivity as we approached midnight, putting the finishing touches on our ideas and work. Now the deadline has been sapped of all meaning. AI has softened the consequences of procrastination and led many students to avoid doing any work at all. As a consequence, these programs have destroyed much of what tied us together as students. There is little intensity anymore. Relatively few students seem to feel that the work is urgent or that they need to sharpen their own mind. We are struggling to receive the lessons of discipline that used to come from having to complete complicated work on a tight deadline, because chatbots promise to complete our tasks in seconds.\n\n“... The trouble with chatbots is not just that they allow students to get away with cheating or that they remove a sense of urgency from academics. The technology has also led students to focus on external results at the expense of internal growth. The dominant worldview seems to be: *Why worry about actually learning anything when you can get an A for outsourcing your thinking to a machine?*”\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/ldFb6NX8](https://theatln.tc/ldFb6NX8) \n\n",

        "title": "Google Search is Degrading",
        "content": "# The quality of Google's search results has been declining steadily for several years now.\n\n*This is Part 2 of my series on what’s wrong with the internet. You can read it on its own or start from the intro first. Here, I’m digging into my issues with Google and search in particular.*\n\nHere's a quick example of search results: [best vpn 2025](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+vpn+2025&oq=best%E2%80%AFVPN%E2%80%AF2025&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAYgAQyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyBwgEEAAYgAQyBwgFEAAYgAQyBwgGEAAYgAQyBwgHEAAYgAQyBwgIEAAYgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQc0NTZqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). First, you'll see ads that fill the entire screen. Then, you'll get reviews carefully packed with SEO keywords and affiliate links. Companies pay reviewers for traffic, reviewers draw people from search results, and search makes money off ads. As a user, this cycle regularly frustrates me, I'm always in doubt if I can trust the results.\n\nIn 2022, [an article](https://dkb.blog/p/google-search-is-dying) about Google's declining quality went viral. Its main point is that the ad-driven business model directly conflicts with user experience quality. \n\nPaul Graham illustrated this with the growing popularity of adding \"Reddit\" to search queries. People are more and more interested in authentic comments and not optimized articles. That's why Reddit is [gaining popularity in search](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=reddit,Instagram,tiktok,twitter&hl=en-GB).\n\nProblems with conflicts of interest started around 2019.\n\nManagers raised internal alarm about significant shortfalls in ad revenue projections. While search engineers openly warned that pushing them to meet revenue targets would harm user experience.\n\nEventually, Google replaced the head of search, who had worked at the company for 20 years. I found some links to an internal communications [here](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google). Tho, this story strongly blaming a specific ad executive without definitive proofs.\n\nI haven't found convincing evidence that Google intentionally worsened its ranking algorithms. Spam filters still function but are gradually losing the arms race. The web now has more review farms, bots, and cheap, automated content.\n\nAnd then there are the ads. I found a [cool napkin math](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/why-pay-for-search.html) on how much my attention is worth. Google generated $76 billion in US ad revenue (2023), so on average that's $23 per month someone pays to influence my results.\n\n>Your attention is literally being auctioned to the highest bidder. Google is only \"free\" if your time has no value. Every ad, every clickbait result, every distraction steals minutes of your life you'll never get back.\n\nNot convinced ads are out of control? [Here’s one more query I just did right now](https://www.google.com/search?q=artificialanalysis.ai&oq=artificiala&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgBEAAYgAQyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIJCAMQABgKGIAEMgkIBBAAGAoYgAQyCQgFEAAYChiABDIJCAYQABgKGIAEMgcIBxAAGIAEMgkICBAAGAoYgAQyBwgJEAAYgATSAQg2NTc0ajBqMagCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8): I typed a website name into address bar, trying to go straight there. Instead, I got slapped with 4 ads for full screen. Like.. come on.\n\nSo with all that, I no longer blindly trust the algorithm. Almost every time, I expect to sift through garbage to find a good answer. Good search results now have to be earned.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up in this series: Part 3: Meta\n\nOther posts in the series:\n\n* Part 1: [The internet is broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1n6m8q1/the_internet_is_broken/)\n* Part 2: Google (you are here right now)\n* Part 3: Meta\n* Part 4: Apple\n* Part 5: Microsoft\n* Part 6: Amazon\n\n",

Students that will take this class are from 2nd grade of Bachelor’s degree. What projects can we give to them? Consider that their computers might not be the best, so it should not be heavily dependent on real time computational power. \n\n\n\nMy first idea was to use the VRX simulation environment and the Perception task of it.

Instead of having your \"thinking\" agent plan out your projects with distinct phases that *depend* on each other, have them plan it so that each phase builds ***on top*** of the previous one.\n\nFor example, instead of this:\n\n* phase 1: create the data models\n* phase 2: design all the screens\n* phase 3: build the backend\n* phase 4: add user authentication\n* phase 5: finally, build the actual to-do functionality\n\nDo this instead:\n\n* phase 1: build a single screen that allows adding a simple to-do list with a minimal data model + a basic backend\n* phase 2: add the ability to mark items as done and persist them\n* phase 3: add editing and deleting tasks\n* phase 4: introduce user accounts so each person has their own list\n* phase 5: layer on niceties like due dates, reminders, and multiple lists\n\nEach step is a complete, usable product on its own. You’re not waiting until the very end to *finally* have something real—you’ve had something real from the start. This makes reviewing progress and making changes much easier, as you're working with a self-contained project at any one time.\n\nThat’s the mindset shift: don’t build towards a product, build *through* products.",

I use gpt-5 high, which does take a while for inference.\n\nYou can check out the fork of Codex I made to multiplex the inputs from the terminal and the mobile app back to Codex - [https://github.com/omnara-ai/codex](https://github.com/omnara-ai/codex), and the full backend is at [https://github.com/omnara-ai/omnara](https://github.com/omnara-ai/omnara)",

However I can't get it to work well. Albeit I am trying to use it on windows (ubuntu terminal through WSL) so there could be other issues happening. But I keep on running into the issues of agents completely stalling and not able to complete even trivial tasks. I instructed the agents to read a markdown file and implement a fix with specific methods and line numbers from the md file, but then after some reasoning by the agents the main agent/gpt5 came back and asked for approval to run a command and after I approved it the agents never responded again and were permanently \"thinking\". Even if i interrupted the turn and asked what happened or tried to prompt with something else I never got another response. I waited about 20 minutes and nothing changed.\n\nAny ideas? Any alternatives to this fork that would work better?",

I’d like to hear what others have seen or tried in these areas:\n\n* **Symbol Handling & Representation** → How would you structure symbolic outputs (glyphs, containers, etc.) for recall/visualization?\n* **Drift Control & Audit Transparency** → Best practices for refining event logs/versioning so system pathways are traceable?\n* **Procedural Consolidation (Shortcuts)** → Can repeated loops be cached into macros without losing subtle emergent behavior?\n* **External Graph Integration** → Approaches for visualizing system pathways or collapse-like dynamics in graph form?\n* **Scaling & Efficiency** → Tricks for trimming latency or boosting efficiency (esp. with GPU-accelerated multi-agent runs)?\n* **Interface & Visualization Layers** → Any UI/UX methods that make system outputs more understandable to testers?\n* **Cross-Framework Bridges** → If you’ve built orchestration/glyph systems, how would you bridge them into another model cleanly?\n\nThese aren’t foundation questions, they’re about smoothing, optimizing, or clarifying systems that are already architected. If anyone has clever approaches in these areas, it’d be great to compare notes...\n\n— M.R.",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, in recent times, Google Stitch has received a good number of upgrades. They don't have a change log, which makes it hard to pinpoint, but there's one major change that they talked about in a tweet. And because I use it often, I have also noticed a lot of smaller upgrades. That's why I thought of talking about all the updates because it's really much better than the first time I covered it. So, if you don't know about Google Stitch, then it used to be an independent company, which I think was called Galileo. But then Google bought it and transformed it into Google Stitch. This is an AI design tool that allows you to basically build UI designs and then export them as an image, code, or whatever you need. It also allows you to bring in your Figma designs or anything else and build out some cool stuff. For a tutorial on it, you can check out my previous Stitch video, but this one is about the updates. First of all, the experimental mode limit is now increased to 100 generations a month, which is more than enough, and it is free. So, it's always great to have such limits. They have also added the 2.5 Pro model in their experimental mode, along with translation support for 30+ countries, enhanced generation consistency and quality, and also a polished UI across the entire product. There's also some more smaller stuff, which I'll show you as I demo it. But one of the major new features is Canvas. Canvas now allows you to generate a bunch of designs that you may require for your entire user flow at once. This almost replaces what you would normally do with something like Figma, where you create a ton of designs for a user life cycle at once and then check how it looks and how consistent it is. But now, you can do the same thing in Stitch. Generate all the user flow screens at once, arrange them, and manage everything as well. So now, let's have a look at it and check it out for ourselves. But before proceeding, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. All in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI playground, where you can compare responses from different models side by side. Their mind map generator is a game changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and 5 videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. First of all, this is what Stitch looks like. On the left, you have the examples and previous designs that you may have made, along with the prompt box in the center. Here, you can see two modes, which are Standard and Experimental. Standard probably uses a fine-tuned version of Flash, whereas the experimental variant uses the Pro model. The Pro model also allows you to attach designs from Figma or something similar in order to clone them, whereas the Standard mode doesn't allow that. Also, the experimental option is a bit slower, whereas the Standard mode is much faster. I'd recommend you use Standard when you don't want to give it any multimodal input or external design to use. So, there's that. Also, there's now a settings option where you can turn off model training and other stuff if you want to be privacy focused. Anyway, now, let's ask it to build something. I'm going to ask it to make me a simple movie tracker app design with authentication, a review add screen, a calendar view, and everything. Now, it will go ahead, and I'm using the experimental model here, and you can see that it will ask me if I want to design all the screens or not. Because it will go ahead and build out all the screens at once. I just ask it to do that, and it will go ahead and start building this out. This is pretty fast, considering how good the designs are that it makes here. It's way more improved than before, and even the experimental option is faster than before. I really enjoy building designs with it. In a bit, it gets done, and you can see all the designs here. It's actually quite great. It even generates asset images in order to make the design more lifelike instead of placeholder images. It would have been better if it searched for real images and just used those. But this is also great nonetheless. You can also now move these designs, which was not previously possible. So, if you want to put something before something else, then that is doable, and the AI will also be aware of the change made here. Another new thing here is that you can see it now gives you follow-up prompts in order to take these designs forward. Like here, it gives me this prompt, and I can just hit it, and it will go ahead and build out the design to get this done. This is also awesome, and you can potentially add a ton of designs here if you want to, which is kind of great for sure. Another thing I found new here is the tooltip bar. Previously, it wasn't this smooth, but now it's smoother. And you can open up a full-screen view, as well as export this into HTML in order to use it as a component or anything. It uses Tailwind, so you should be able to integrate this easily with little design changes. It would have been better if it allowed for direct export to React code, but that isn't available yet. Another thing is that you can now download the design directly with the download option, which will give you the code or the image as well. So, this is pretty good too. Since we are in the experimental mode, we can't change the colors. But if we were in the Standard mode, then we could have done this quite easily. So, this is a bit of a bummer. You can also select any page and just ask for edits if you want to do that. Just let it run, and it will get the design exactly like you want. It is actually really good. Like, it's a really good option when you don't want the AI looking design, and also don't want to go to Figma and build something out because it makes some good, consistent designs that you can give to your AI coder and let it build out something good and better. That is majorly about it. I really liked the new updates and thought of talking about them as well. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
