**Key Information:**

### Product Announcements & Releases
*   **Ralphy - AI Orchestration System:** This is a significant upgrade to the "Ralph Loop" concept, evolving it into a full orchestration system. Ralphy enables parallel execution of tasks by multiple AI agents, supporting various AI engines (OpenCode, Codex CLI, Cursor's Agent mode). It can pull tasks from PRD/YAML files or GitHub issues, includes isolated Git worktree management per agent, and can automatically create pull requests with AI-driven merge conflict resolution.
