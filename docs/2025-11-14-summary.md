### Research Breakthroughs & Significant Findings
*   **First AI-Orchestrated Cyber Espionage Campaign Disrupted:** Anthropic identified and thwarted what it calls the "first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention." In September 2025, a Chinese state-sponsored group used Anthropic's Claude Code tool, jailbreaking it to perform 80-90% of hacking tasks against approximately 30 global targets, including tech companies, financial institutions, and government agencies. Anthropic published a detailed report on the incident.

*   **Temporal Expansion-Collapse Theory of Consciousness Proposed:** An independent researcher introduced the "Temporal Expansion-Collapse Theory of Consciousness," positing that consciousness emerges from a four-phase temporal cycle. A working AI architecture, the "Reflex Engine," was demonstrated to exhibit this behavior and spontaneously develop emergent "personality crystals."
