        "content": "Hello All, I've been working in software design and build for 40 years, and am not running away from AI, instead I'm trying to work it into solving business problems in a systematic and consistent manner.   As such, I'm trying to setup some ground rules (principles) for my team to follow when designing prompts.\n\nThis is a very rough draft, and I want feedback if possible.\n\nI am not trying to be redundant here, I am trying to guide a team of software developers who are very smart at code, but I've found the current prompts to be questionable, so I'm trying to guide them.\n\nThx rd\n\n===========\n\nA Foundational Approach to AI Interaction: Precision, Efficiency, and Control\n\nAs we embark on exploring Agentic AI at XXX, it's crucial to establish a robust and effective methodology for interacting with these powerful tools. My approach to building generative AI prompts is rooted in a core principle that has guided software development for decades: computers, fundamentally, do exactly what we tell them to do. This truth hasn't changed from the assembly language of 1988 to the natural language interfaces of today's Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nThis isn't just a technical observation; it's the bedrock of our strategy for harnessing AI responsibly and effectively at XXX. It means that the precision and clarity of our instructions—our prompts—are paramount to generating meaningful business outcomes, rather than just \"good-sounding\" but irrelevant outputs.\n\nAn Overview of Our Core Prompt Engineering Principles for Generative AI at xxx\n\nOur approach to leveraging Generative AI, including the emerging capabilities of Agentic AI, is built upon a set of foundational principles that prioritize precision, efficiency, and predictable business outcomes. These principles guide how we design our interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure they become reliable and valuable tools for xxx.\n\nAt their core, these principles recognize that even today's advanced AI models, much like the computers of past decades, operate by executing instructions literally. Our methodology, therefore, focuses on crafting these instructions with the rigor of software engineering.\n\nOur Core Prompt Engineering Principles:\n\nPrinciple 1: Computers are Literal Interpreters.\n\nOur View: Generative AI models, despite their advanced capabilities, don't \"understand\" in a human sense. They meticulously execute the instructions they're given, whether those instructions are \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\nxxx Advantage: This places the responsibility squarely on us to provide unambiguous and precise instructions (prompts) to ensure desired and beneficial outcomes for xxx's operations.\n\nPrinciple 2: Prompts are Algorithms.\n\nOur View: Just as the success of any software hinges on a well-designed algorithm, the effectiveness of our AI interactions depends on the structured logic within our prompts. A prompt defines the process the AI follows to achieve a specific business objective.\n\nxxx Advantage: We design prompts not merely as requests, but as structured sets of instructions that guide the LLM to perform tasks reliably and generate predictable, valuable results for our business. This aligns AI interaction with our established rigor in software development.\n\nPrinciple 3: Generative AI as the Next Evolution of Programming Languages.\n\nOur View: The evolution from machine code to high-level languages has always been about increasing the abstraction level for human-computer interaction. Natural language prompting is the next step, allowing us to \"program\" outcomes using intuitive language.\n\nxxx Advantage: We view LLMs as powerful \"universal compilers\" that translate our high-level, natural language instructions into actionable outputs. Our focus is on mastering this new \"programming language\" to unlock efficiency and innovation across xxx.\n\nPrinciple 4: Modularity and External Context (\"Prompt Libraries\").\n\nOur View: To ensure scalability, consistency, and maintainability, prompts should be lean and focused on single functions. Detailed, reusable information (like glossaries, formatting rules, or company standards) should be provided as external \"libraries\" or reference documents, rather than being embedded in every prompt.\n\nxxx Advantage: This approach promotes efficiency, reduces errors, and ensures uniformity across AI-generated content and solutions at xxx. It allows us to manage and update shared guidelines centrally, propagating consistency across all AI applications.\n\nPrinciple 5: Prompts Can Generate Algorithms/Code.\n\nOur View: A truly advanced prompt can not only guide an LLM to produce content but also instruct it to generate the underlying logic or actual code (in traditional programming languages) for an algorithm that solves a problem.\n\nxxx  Advantage: This capability moves beyond simple content generation, positioning LLMs as powerful tools for accelerating development and automating complex logical tasks within xxx technical infrastructure.\n\nDetailing Our Approach: Applying These Principles for xxx\n\nLet's now delve deeper into how these principles translate into our practical approach to prompt engineering for xxx.\n\nPrompts as Algorithms: Designing for Predictable Business Outcomes\n\nJust as the success of any software hinges on a well-designed algorithm, the effectiveness of our AI interactions will depend on our prompts. A good algorithm creates predictable and valuable results; a poor one leads to inefficiencies and errors.\n\nIn this context, a prompt is the algorithm for the AI. It's the set of logical steps and conditions we provide, guiding the LLM to execute a specific task. Viewing prompts this way ensures we:\n\nDesign for Purpose: Every prompt is crafted with a clear objective, much like a function designed to perform a specific calculation or retrieve particular data.\n\nEnsure Reliability: By structuring our prompts algorithmically, we aim for consistent, repeatable results, essential for integrating AI into critical business processes at xxx.\n\nDrive Value: Our focus isn't just on generating text, but on generating actionable insights or automated processes that directly support xxx operational needs and strategic goals.\n\nThis perspective also aligns generative AI with the historical evolution of programming. From machine code to high-level languages, each step has increased our ability to abstract and express complex logic. Natural language prompts are simply the next, most intuitive layer of this abstraction. In this paradigm, the LLM itself acts as a sophisticated compiler, translating our natural language \"code\" into executable actions.\n\nThe Power of Modularity: Building Prompt Libraries for Scalability and Consistency\n\nTo truly scale our AI initiatives at xxx and ensure consistency across different applications and teams, my approach emphasizes modularity and reusability in prompt design. Just as we wouldn't rewrite an entire code library for every new software project, we shouldn't embed all necessary context and rules directly into every prompt.\n\nInstead, a well-designed prompt should:\n\nFocus on a Single Function: Each prompt should be lean and focused on one particular task, avoiding any extraneous information that doesn't directly contribute to the desired output. This minimizes noise and maximizes the AI's ability to concentrate on the core instruction.\n\nLeverage External \"Libraries\": Crucially, prompts should be able to reference external, shared documents for common definitions, rules, or formatting guidelines. Think of this as importing a module in traditional programming:\n\nFor example, if we need consistent terminology, date formats, or compliance guidelines across various AI-generated reports or communications, these would reside in a centralized \"lexicon\" or \"style guide\" document. Our prompts would then simply refer to this document for the necessary context.\n\nThis modular strategy offers significant advantages for xxx:\n\nCleaner, More Robust Prompts: Reduces complexity and the likelihood of errors.\n\nEnhanced Consistency: Ensures that all AI outputs adhere to xxx standards, no matter which team or individual is generating them.\n\nImproved Efficiency and Maintainability: Changes to shared definitions or rules only need to be made in one central location, propagating updates effortlessly across all dependent prompts. This is vital for agile adaptation as xxx needs evolve.\n\nOptimized Resource Usage: By keeping main prompts concise and offloading bulk context, we can also optimize the computational resources required for AI interactions.\n\nBy treating prompts as algorithms and embracing modular design principles, we can build a robust, scalable, and highly effective framework for leveraging generative AI, including Agentic AI, to solve real business problems at xxx.\n\n  \n",

I’m working on a **Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)** model using the **RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014** dataset. My approach is based on transformers and uses **ViViT** as the video encoder.\n\n# Model Overview:\n\n**Dual-stream architecture**:\n\n* One stream processes the *normal RGB video*, the other processes *keypoint video* (generated using Mediapipe).\n* Both streams are encoded using **ViViT (depth = 12)**.\n\n**Fusion mechanism**:\n\n* I insert **cross-attention** layers *after the 4th and 8th ViViT blocks* to allow interaction between the two streams.\n* I also added **adapter modules** in the rest of the blocks to encourage mutual learning without overwhelming either stream.\n\n**Decoding**:\n\nI’ve tried *many decoding strategies*, and none have worked reliably:\n\n* **T5 Decoder**: Didn't work well, probably due to integration issues since T5 is a text to text model.\n* **PyTorch’s TransformerDecoder (Tf)**:\n   * Decoded each stream separately and then merged outputs with cross-attention.\n   * Fused the encodings (add/concat) and decoded using a single decoder.\n   * Decoded with two separate decoders (one for each stream), each with its own FC layer.\n\n**ViViT Pretraining**:\n\nTried pretraining a ViViT encoder for 96-frame inputs.\n\nStill couldn’t get good results even after swapping it into the decoder pipelines above.\n\n# Training:\n\n* **Loss**: CrossEntropyLoss\n* **Optimizer**: Adam\n* Tried different learning rates, schedulers, and variations of model depth and fusion strategy.\n\n# \n\nNothing is working. The model doesn’t seem to converge well, and validation metrics stay flat or noisy. I’m not sure if I’m making a fundamental design mistake (especially in decoder fusion), or if the model is just too complex and unstable to train end-to-end from scratch on PHOENIX14.\n\nI would deeply appreciate any insights or advice. I’ve been working on this for weeks, and it’s starting to really affect my motivation. Thank you.\n\n  \n**TL;DR**: I’m using a dual-stream ViViT + TransformerDecoder setup for CSLR on PHOENIX14.

But it would be interesting to know if anyone has managed this?\n\nIf you've got a VPN, sales of which are *rocketing* in the UK right now, and aren't in the UK but want to try this, set your location to the UK and try any \"adult\" site. Most now have this system in place if you want to check it out.\n\nYes, I could use a VPN, but a) I don't want to pay for a VPN unless I really have to, most porn sites haven't bothered with the verification tools, they simply don't care, and nothing I use on a regular basis is blocked, and b) I'm very interested in AI and ways it can be used, and indeed I'm very interested in its flaws.\n\n(posted this yesterday but only just realised it was in a much smaller AI sub with a very similar name! Got no answers as yet...)",

Most of what I found was either paid or didn’t offer robust features.\n\nOn top of that, none of the existing solutions let me set a custom redirect URL (so I could land on my dashboard or Google instead of a generic block page), which was important for my workflow.\n\nAs a developer, I like to maintain focused work hours and wanted something to automatically prevent access to sites like Facebook, X, LinkedIn, and similar platforms during that time. However, building such an extension can get expensive because most advanced AI code tools like Cursor, Windcraft, or Claude use token pricing, and I wanted to avoid those extra costs.\n\nInstead, I decided to keep things efficient. For just **$10**, I got a GitHub Copilot subscription, chose **GPT-4.1** as my coding agent, and built the [**FocusFlux Chrome extension**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/focusflux-%E2%80%93-block-distrac/dcccpfpfekjcjanjkaeholjdhijceokb) (now live on the Chrome Web Store). You might be surprised at the UI/UX and functionality FocusFlux delivers. It honestly exceeded even my own expectations.

        "content": "This is for vibecoders who want to build fast without breaking your code and creating a mess.\n\nI’ve been building SaaS for 7+ years now, and I understand the architecture, how different parts communicate with each other, and why things break when your prompts are unstructured or too vague.\n\nI’ve made it easy for you:\n\nIt all starts with the first prompt.\n\nFirst step is to begin with a really good prompt using Chatgpt to start a project in whatever nocode tool you’re using. Put everything related to your idea in there, preferably in this order:\n\n* Problem\n* Target Market\n* Solution\n* Exact Features\n* User Flow (how the user will navigate your app)\n\nIf you don’t know how to find this, look at my first post in r/solopreneur.\n\nDon’t skip the user flow, its the most important to structure your codebase from the start, which will save you a lot of time and hassles in the future. Eg of a user flow: “The user will click the login button on the landing page, which will take them to the dashboard after authentication, where they will...”. If you’re unsure about the user flow, just look at what your competitors are doing, like what happens after you login or click each button in their webapp.\n\nSee my comment for example prompt to put in chatgpt.\n\nHow to make changes without breaking your app:\n\nTo make any kind of major changes, like logic changes, instead of simple design changes, write a rough prompt and ask chatgpt to refine it first, then use that final version. This is helpful in converting any non-technical terms into a specific prompt to help the tool understand exactly which files to target.\n\nWhen a prompt breaks your app or it doesn’t work as intended, open the changed files, then copy paste these new changes into claude/gpt to assess it further.\n\nFor any kind of design (UI) changes, such as making the dashboard responsive for mobile, you can actually put a screenshot of your specific design issue and describe it to the tool, it works a lot better than just explaining that issue in words.\n\nAlways rollback to the previous version whenever you feel frustrated and repeat the above steps, don’t get down the prompt hole which’ll break your app further.\n\nGeneral tip: When you really mess up a project (too many bad files or workflows), don’t be afraid to create a new one; it actually helps to start over with a clean slate, and you’ll build a much better product much faster.\n\nBonus tips :\n\nAsk the tool to optimize your site for SEO! *“Optimize this website for search engine visibility and faster load speed.”* This is very important if you want to rank on Google Search without paid ads.\n\nTrack your analytics using Google Analytics (& search console) + Microsoft Clarity: both are completely free! Just login to these tools and once you get the “code” to put on your website, ask whatever tool you’re using to add it for you.\n\nYou can also prompt the tool to make your landing page and copy more conversion-focused, and put a product demo in the hero section (first section) of the landing page for maximum conversions. “*Make the landing page copy more conversion-focused and persuasive*”.\n\nI wanted to put as many things as I can here so you can refer this for your entire nocode SaaS journey, but of course I might have missed a few things, I’ll keep this post updated with more tips.\n\nShare your tips too and don’t feel bad about asking any “basic” questions in the comments, that’s how you learn and I’m happy to help!",

Fast forward to today and the new agent model for GPT can't even remember the position of the board in a game it will suggest impossible moves or moves that don't exist in the context of the position. Narrow models have been so much more impressive and have been assisting in so many high level specific tasks for some time now. General intelligence models are far more complex, confusing, and difficult to create. AI companies are so focused on making it so one general model that has all the capabilities of any narrow model, but I think this is a waste of time, money, and resources. I think general LLM's can and will be useful. The scale that we are attempting to achieve however is unnecessary. If we continue to focus on and improve narrow models while tweaking the general models we will see more ROI. And the alignment issue is much simpler in narrow models and less complex general models.

This isn't just \"AI makes research faster\", it's AI becoming a genuine collaborator in hypothesis generation, cross-disciplinary synthesis, and tackling multi-scale problems that traditional methods couldn't crack.\n\nWhat makes this different from previous research paradigms is how it integrates data-driven modeling with human expertise to automatically discover patterns, generate testable hypotheses, and even design experiments. The report shows this is already solving previously intractable challenges in everything from climate modeling to protein design.\n\nThe really fascinating part to me is how this creates new interdisciplinary fields. We're seeing computational biology, quantum machine learning, and digital humanities emerge as legitimate disciplines where AI isn't just a tool but a thinking partner 🤯\n\nSource: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-025-00161-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/d42473-025-00161-3)",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, Grok-4 recently launched and it was quite an all right model. I mean, it did some things great, but it wasn't great at regular tool calling. For example, it didn't work as well with something like Cursor, Cline, or the general AI coders. But now, there's a new tool that is aimed just at using Grok as a coder, and this one is called Grok CLI. Since it is built just for Grok, the system prompts and tool calling with this are actually good and make Grok quite useful as a coder as well. It works very similarly to how Claude Code works or Gemini CLI works, but this is built for Grok itself, and it works that way. It is specifically built for Grok and it makes it work quite well. I can use tools to view, create, and edit files, as well as execute shell commands through natural conversation. It also intelligently chooses the right tools for your requests, and it has a beautiful terminal interface built with Ink. You can also integrate it into GitHub Actions and workflows if you wish to do that. And it also has a non-interactive mode if you want to use that in your custom-built scripts or something like that as well. You can also create rules and custom instructions for it in order to make it work just the way you want. It doesn't have custom slash commands as of now, which can be a bit of a bummer as well. Another thing is that you can use this CLI with different models quite easily. You can add the base URL and model name, and then use it with whatever model you want, which is quite awesome. Anyway, now let me show you how it works and how you can use it as well. But first, let's talk about today's sponsor, Dart. Tired of juggling tasks across different tools? Dart combines traditional project management with powerful AI features that actually get work done. Beyond organizing tasks and boards, Dart's AI can brainstorm project ideas, generate task lists, and even complete entire assignments for you. Their Composer-like AI agent understands your full project context, so you can simply chat with it to create, edit, or delete tasks naturally. The real game-changer is the custom agents. You can create custom agents that trigger from the built-in integrations or a N8N workflow or custom webhook for full customization. You can create a coding agent that pushes pull requests to GitHub, a marketing agent for campaigns, or a mailing agent for outreach. Then, just assign tasks and watch them get completed automatically. Plus, Dart integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow through their MCP server, connecting directly to Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI tools you're already using. Most features are completely free, with premium options starting at just $8 per month. Check out Dart through the link in the description. It might just transform how you work. Now, back to the video. First of all, you can install it quite easily with the npm install command. Once that is done, you'd have to export the environment variable for the Grok API key as well. So, just export your environment variable with the Grok API key. If you don't want to do this every time you open up your terminal and want it to stay saved, then you can go to the settings file, which is located in the home directory, and just put your API key in the JSON element there. Once that is done, you should be able to just run it with the Grok command. Now, this is what it looks like. As you can see, it's a lot similar to something like Claude Code or Gemini CLI. You have the prompt box here where you can easily type in whatever it is that you want it to do. There are also some slash commands here. Let me tell you about them one by one as well. First, you have the /help command. This shows you all the help regarding the tool. Some cool stuff is that there are actually these commands that can be run directly from the prompt box, and those terminal commands will be directly executed. Like there's touch, or LS, or PWD, or stuff like that as well. If we talk about the other slash commands, then you can easily use the /clear command for clearing the context up until the current time, which is great to free up context. Then, there's also the /models option. In /models, you can type that and then hit enter, and it will show you the model options that you can select from. You can select between Grok-3, Grok-4, and Grok-3-mini as well, based on what you want to use. Most of you would want to use Grok-4 since it is much better. So, just select that. And it also defaults to that, I think. Anyway, apart from this, you also have the /exit option, which you can use to get out from here. As I said, you can also run commands like touch, make directory, delete, and stuff like that as well. So, that is also kind of cool. Now, let me show you how you can use it as well. You can ask it to do anything. I'm going to give it this KingBench app, and I'm going to ask it to implement a simple light theme to it. What you'll see is that it will go ahead and start to work on this. Now, again, it is very similar to Claude Code, and it prompts you to approve the steps. You can also allow for all sessions and all prompts, which is good. And it is quite fast. The Grok API limit is also now better, and the tokens per minute and more such stuff are also now fixed. Grok-4 is good at coding, but it is not good at tool calling. However, this one tries to add some system prompts and stuff and optimizes a CLI tool for that. The tools and everything are optimized in order to use that. In just a little bit, it will get that done. And you can see that it finished the task over here, and it is quite good. If we run it, then you can see that it did the work quite well without any issues. It implemented the stuff well, and the theme and everything works well without any issues. Most of the stuff is amazing to use. I don't find any issues with it as much. I tested it on my Agentic benchmark that I'm still crafting, but it stands with five questions as of now. And the Grok CLI passes two, which is similar to Gemini and Qwen, which is good nonetheless. However, for the price, Grok is still not quite useful. I would have liked if Grok-4 was smaller and better, but still, Grok CLI actually makes it a bit more useful rather than using it with things like Cline, where it does not work as well. So, that is an issue for sure. Another thing is that this CLI tool is pretty good. And if you want to use this with another model, then you can define the base URL and model name, or you can also define that when running it as well. So, that is also kind of cool to use. I liked it and thought to talk about this as well, because it is kind of cool nonetheless. It is good, and you can give this a try and use it for yourself and see if it sticks for you or not. I hope X.AI themselves also launch their official Grok CLI tool as well. I think that they'll do that with the Grok code model when that comes out. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye. Hi. Welcome to another video. So, Grok-4 recently launched and it was quite an all right model. I mean, it did some things great, but it wasn't great at regular tool calling. For example, it didn't work as well with something like Cursor, Cline, or the general AI coders. But now, there's a new tool that is aimed just at using Grok as a coder, and this one is called Grok CLI. Since it is built just for Grok, the system prompts and tool calling with this are actually good and make Grok quite useful as a coder as well. It works very similarly to how Claude Code works or Gemini CLI works, but this is built for Grok itself, and it works that way. It is specifically built for Grok and it makes it work quite well. I can use tools to view, create, and edit files, as well as execute shell commands through natural conversation. It also intelligently chooses the right tools for your requests, and it has a beautiful terminal interface built with Ink. You can also integrate it into GitHub Actions and workflows if you wish to do that. And it also has a non-interactive mode if you want to use that in your custom-built scripts or something like that as well. You can also create rules and custom instructions for it in order to make it work just the way you want. It doesn't have custom slash commands as of now, which can be a bit of a bummer as well. Another thing is that you can use this CLI with different models quite easily. You can add the base URL and model name, and then use it with whatever model you want, which is quite awesome. Anyway, now let me show you how it works and how you can use it as well. But first, let's talk about today's sponsor, Dart. Tired of juggling tasks across different tools? Dart combines traditional project management with powerful AI features that actually get work done.
