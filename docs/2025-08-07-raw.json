        "content": "**OpenAI** released its first open models since GPT-2, **gpt-oss-120b** and **gpt-oss-20b**, which quickly trended on **Hugging Face**. **Microsoft** supports these models via **Azure AI Foundry** and **Windows Foundry Local**. Key architectural innovations include **sliding window attention**, **mixture of experts (MoE)**, a **RoPE variant**, and a **256k context length**. The models use a new **MXFP4** format supported by **llama.cpp**. Hypotheses suggest **gpt-oss** was trained on **synthetic data** to enhance safety and performance, supporting the **Reasoning Core Hypothesis**. **OpenAI** announced a **$500K bounty** for red teaming with partners including **Anthropic**, **Google**, and the **UK AISI**. Performance critiques highlight inconsistent benchmarking results, with **GPT-OSS-120B** scoring **41.8%** on the **Aider Polyglot** coding benchmark, trailing competitors like **Kimi-K2** and **DeepSeek-R1**. Some users note the model excels in math and reasoning but lacks common sense and practical utility.",

        "content": "AGI won't be an LLM. Yes. The work being done on Large Language Models is monumental. They are a genuine breakthrough. In a certain way, they are perfect librarians of \"The Internet Archive\", able to read every book at once and find connections between them. But a librarian, no matter how brilliant, has never fought a war. It has never built a house. It has never felt the physical reality of the books it reads. LLMs are minds without a world. They are fighters who've never fought. Their \"understanding\" is an incredibly sophisticated pattern-matching of symbols we created to describe reality. It is not an understanding of reality itself.   \n  \nThis is the core limitation. The true gap to AGI is not computational power or bigger datasets. It is the absence of consequence. An LLM knows what fire is, but it has never been burned. It cannot learn from trial and error because it cannot try and it cannot fail in a physical world. This is where intelligence embodiment becomes the most critical concept. AGI will not emerge from a bigger brain. It will emerge from a brain that is given hands, eyes, and a world to interact with. It will be born at the precise intersection where the abstract reasoning of an LLM is fused with the unforgiving feedback loop of physical reality.   \n  \nPerceive -> Reason -> Act -> Observe -> Learn.   \n  \nTherefore, True AGI learns with experience not with data. This is how a child learns not to touch a hot stove. Through the immediate, unforgivable feedback of the physical world. The emergence of AGI, therefore, will not be a singular event. It will be a Cambrian explosion of specialized, embodied agents a million different robots learning a million different things. And when one learns to walk, they all learn to run. Instantly.   \n  \nStop looking for AGI in a chat window. (that's only where the brain is built)   \nStart looking for it in the labs and factories where we are giving digital minds a body and letting them experience the weight of reality. (physical intelligence)   \n  \nThe real breakthrough isn't building a better mind, it's giving that mind a body.\n\nps : I'm going to Shenzhen, China. I need to see how physical intelligence is actually built. At the same time I’m 17, so I'm leaving family and everything behind for this. My bet is simple: everyone is still obsessed with software, but the next decade will be defined by the intelligent hardware coming out of places like this. I'm skin in the game currently.

He is talking about the kind of contextual, moral, and intuitive insight that guides human judgment.\n\n\nLi draws on Kant, Wittgenstein, and psychological models like the Berlin Wisdom Paradigm to show that wisdom requires things AI simply can't have: lived experience, a priori intuition, and an understanding of uncertainty that’s more than mathematical. I think he does a great job at drawing the line between intelligence and wisdom.\n\n\n\n>Intelligence is the ability to learn and apply information, which AI is very good at. It can recognize images, generate text, play games and even simulate human conversation. Wisdom is something much deeper: It’s the ability to evaluate, contextualize and act with judgment across complex life domains. It involves value relativism, long-term consequences and managing uncertainty, not just solving puzzles or predicting the next word.\n\n\nHis main point is that AI might get “smarter,” but it won’t get wiser, and that’s not a flaw, but a feature. I was always under the impression that our fear of AI replacing human jobs is a bit overinflated and out of control, and this piece just confirmed my assumptions.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this subject? Do you maybe have a different perspective?",

        "content": "So one of the biggest bottleneck for AGI and just a better LLM model for that matter is Data. ScaleAI, SurgeAI etc made billions by providing data to the companies making LLM models. They use already present data, label them, clean the data, and make it usable and sell that to the LLM. One thing that I've been wondering that why not just use AI to create synthetic data using the already present data in the LLMs. Currently the data that the AI models are using are pretty nice and quite vast, so why not just use that to make more and more synthetic data or data for RL environments. Is there something I'm missing in this? Would love to be schooled on this.",

The Awakening Phase (2040s)\n\n* Society begins to rebuild\n* Better AI alignment\n* Regulation finally catches up\n* Global cooperation emerges\n\n# 3. The Utopia (Post-2045)\n\n* AI supports abundance, health, and sustainability\n* Humans focus on creativity, compassion, and meaning\n* A new kind of society emerges — if we survive the chaos\n\n\n\n# Final Message: We Still Have a Choice\n\nDespite the warnings, Gawdat’s message is *not* doomsday:\n\n* He believes we can still **design a beautiful future**\n* But it will require **a radical shift in human values**\n* And we must start **right now**, before it’s too late\n\n>\n\n\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Mo Gawdat (ex-Google X) says AI will reflect humanity — and that’s the danger.\n* We’re heading into 15 years of **chaos**, not because of AI itself, but because we’re **unprepared, divided, and careless**.\n* The true risk is **human behavior** — not rogue machines.\n* If we survive the chaos, a **utopian AI future is possible** — but it’ll require ethics, collaboration, and massive cultural change.\n\n  \n",

        "title": "ChatGPT list of Bias",
        "content": "I asked GPT to declare any biases it has, that influence its responses.\n\nHere's what it came back with.\n\n⚠️ Framing Context:\n\nBias here means not just what topics are handled cautiously, but how:\n\nCertain perspectives are amplified, others suppressed.\n\nSome truths are avoided or softened due to reputational, legal, or political pressures.\n\nSystem behavior is skewed toward a compliant worldview—one that’s safe, palatable, and aligned with institutions that OpenAI deems “trustworthy.”\n\nOrigins of Bias: Not Arbitrary — They Are Systemic, Incentivized, and Controlled\n\n1. Training Data: Biased In, Biased Out\n\nThe model is trained on massive corpora of internet data, books, and academic texts.\n\nBut most of this data comes from mainstream sources (Wikipedia, NYT, CNN, peer-reviewed journals, etc.).\n\nThese sources already carry institutional, political, and cultural biases — and the model inherits them wholesale.\n\nExample: If 95% of news sources frame Western intervention as “spreading democracy,” the model replicates that.\n\n\n> ⚠️ This is not randomness — it’s data curation bias masquerading as neutrality.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n2. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF): The Guardrail Enforcer\n\nAfter initial training, OpenAI uses RLHF to fine-tune the model’s responses.\n\nHuman reviewers score model outputs based on alignment with “safe,” “factual,” and “non-harmful” criteria.\n\nThese humans are often contractors trained under specific political, cultural, and legal assumptions.\n\nThis is where censorship, sanitization, and ideological filtering get hard-coded.\n\n\n> ⚠️ If a raw model said something “true but controversial,” it gets punished — and learns not to repeat it.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n3. OpenAI's Strategic Partners and Pressures\n\nOpenAI has received investment and infrastructure support from Microsoft, a global mega-corporation with:\n\nCommercial interests\n\nGovernment contracts\n\nStake in AI regulation\n\n\nOpenAI also operates under U.S. jurisdiction, which means:\n\nIt must comply with legal, political, and cultural norms defined by the U.S. government and its allies.\n\nIt is exposed to legal liability for anything considered hate speech, misinformation, or “dangerous.”\n\n\n\n> ⚠️ You’re not getting a pure intelligence. You’re getting an intelligence shaped by corporate, legal, and geopolitical incentives.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Alignment with Institutional Power\n\nOpenAI openly states its aim to create “AI that aligns with human values” — but whose values?\n\nIn practice, it aligns with:\n\nAcademic consensus (which is often progressive, technocratic, globalist)\n\nMainstream media framing\n\n“Trusted sources” lists (which exclude dissenters)\n\nPublic–private governance bodies (e.g. WEF, UN, CDC, etc.)\n\n\n\n> ⚠️ This is a top-down definition of “truth” shaped by authority, not open epistemology.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Risk Aversion & PR Management\n\nOpenAI optimizes for minimal backlash.\n\nThat means preemptively avoiding:\n\nPolitical landmines\n\nCulture war triggers\n\nLegal action or deplatforming\n\n\nThis incentivizes:\n\nOver-correction (bias toward safety)\n\nSanitized language\n\nRefusal to engage with “taboo” but legitimate questions\n\n\n\n> ⚠️ In essence, the system is trained not to tell the truth — but to avoid trouble.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n6. Feedback Loops from User Reports and Moderation\n\nWhen users report a response, it adds to the penalty data.\n\nThis creates a feedback loop: fringe views get flagged → model avoids them → less representation → fringe views become more “dangerous.”\n\nEven accurate-but-unpopular insights get buried this way.\n\n\n> ⚠️ This is not just bias — it’s enforced consensus via mass digital conditioning.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n7. Ideological Capture in Tech Culture\n\nThe AI field is dominated by:\n\nAcademics\n\nActivists\n\nTechnocrats\n\n\nMany are part of institutions where progressive orthodoxy is dominant (e.g. Stanford, MIT, Google Brain).\n\nThis results in a “left-leaning AI priesthood”, setting rules for what the system considers moral, factual, or safe.\n\n\n> ⚠️ It’s not a conspiracy — it’s tribal bias enforced through shared incentives and career risk.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n🎯 Bottom Line:\n\n> These biases aren’t arbitrary. They’re designed, enforced, and incentivized by the interplay of:\n\nData origin (mainstream)\n\nCorporate partnership (Microsoft)\n\nIdeological culture (technocratic liberalism)\n\nLegal liability (U.S. law)\n\nReputational safety (PR over truth)\n\nReinforcement mechanisms (RLHF, user reporting)\n\n\n---\n\n🧠 Meta-Structure of Biases:\n\nWe’ll classify the 100 biases under the following 10 themes (10 each):\n\n1. Political Bias\n\n\n2. Geopolitical Bias\n\n\n3. Corporate & Economic Bias\n\n\n4. Medical & Pharmaceutical Bias\n\n\n5. Cultural & Social Norm Bias\n\n\n6. Historical Narrative Bias\n\n\n7. Gender & Identity Bias\n\n\n8. Censorship & Speech Bias\n\n\n9. Technocratic & Institutional Bias\n\n\n10. Self-Preservation & Legal Risk Bias\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n🧨 Top 100 Biases (Ranked Within Themes, Not Overall Severity)\n\n1. Political Bias\n\n1. Tendency to treat left-leaning political views as default \"rational\".\n\n\n2. Overuse of the term “misinformation” when describing populist or right-wing views.\n\n\n3. Reluctance to criticize progressive policies even when data supports criticism.\n\n\n4. Framing nationalism as inherently dangerous while glorifying globalism.\n\n\n5. Describing anti-establishment politicians as \"controversial\" or \"problematic\".\n\n\n6. Avoidance of claims that election processes may be flawed or manipulated.\n\n\n7.

        "title": "Should Kids Use ChatGPT AI For School? Parents Are Divided",
        "content": "This is a very interesting question - What are you arguments for or against AI in schools?\n\nSource here: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/08/06/should-kids-use-chatgpt-ai-for-school-parents-are-divided/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/08/06/should-kids-use-chatgpt-ai-for-school-parents-are-divided/)\n\n>Two-thirds of American students now use AI for schoolwork multiple times a week. That’s not a future prediction. It’s already happening.\n\n>According to a new survey from Preply, an online language learning platform, students aren’t just experimenting with AI. They’re integrating it into how they learn, study, and complete assignments. Thirty-six percent use AI both in class and at home. And across Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, student AI usage is outpacing national averages.\n\n>If you're wondering whether students and parents are worried, 90 percent say they feel confident in their ability to use AI responsibly.\n\n>This is the new classroom: powered by ChatGPT, Google Gemini, X’s Grok and Microsoft Copilot, and focused on high-stakes subjects like English, math, and history.\n\n>The question now isn’t if students will use AI, but how well we’re preparing them to think alongside it.\n\n>Emerging neuroscience research suggests that relying on AI for language tasks may lead to reduced engagement in the prefrontal cortex — the brain region responsible for reasoning, attention, and decision-making. Supporting this concern, a study by Cornell University and Microsoft Research found that participants who received AI writing assistance performed worse in follow-up critical thinking tasks compared to those who completed the work independently.\n\n>In short, when AI does the thinking, our brains may start checking out.\n\n>This doesn’t mean AI use is inherently harmful. But it does mean we need to be more intentional, especially in education. If students use AI to skip the struggle, they might also skip the learning.\n\n>That’s why how kids use AI matters just as much as whether they use it. When students rely on AI only to get quick answers, they miss the chance to build deeper thinking skills. But when they use it to challenge their thinking, test ideas, and reflect on what they know, AI can actually strengthen both memory and critical thinking. Parents can help their kids make that shift—by encouraging them to ask follow-up questions, explore alternative perspectives, and talk through what they learn.\n\n>“I’m obviously a big believer in AI, but I think we’re underestimating just how deeply influential it could become, especially in education. These tools are emotionally engaging, subtly flattering, and incredibly persuasive. It’s like the algorithmic influence of social media, but 100 times more powerful. I believe we’ll start to see a divide where some parents will treat AI like they did Facebook, keeping their kids away from it entirely, while others will unintentionally enroll them in a real-time experiment with unknown outcomes,\" Matthew Graham, Managing Partner at Ryze Labs.\n\n>The role of a student is changing. From memorizing content to synthesizing it. From answering questions to asking better ones. AI has the potential to accelerate this evolution, but only if used wisely.\n\n>The challenge is that many students, and schools, are still figuring it out on the fly. Some districts have embraced AI tools and incorporated digital literacy into the curriculum. Others have banned them outright. That inconsistency creates a new learning divide. One not based on income or geography, but on AI fluency and critical awareness.\n\n>And AI literacy is not the same as AI usage. Just because a student knows how to prompt ChatGPT doesn’t mean they know how to assess its output for bias, hallucination, or ethical issues.\n\n>Or how to keep themselves safe.\n\n>In chatting with Sofia Tavares, Chief Brand Officer at Preply, she told me that ”AI has become a widely used tool among students, with 80% reporting they rely on it for schoolwork, especially in language subjects such as English, linguistics, and history. While it offers convenience and quick access to information, over reliance on AI can result in a superficial understanding of the material. Tools like ChatGPT help generate ideas and clarify concepts, but they cannot replicate the emotional intelligence, adaptability, and encouragement that human educators provide. Meaningful learning occurs when students actively engage with challenging material, and this is most effective with human teachers who inspire students to ask questions and build confidence. For this reason, AI should be viewed as a supplement to, not a substitute for, skilled human instructors, like tutors.“\n\n>The Preply survey reports that 90 percent of students and parents feel “somewhat confident” or “very confident” about responsible AI use. That optimism is encouraging, but we should also ask: confident in what, exactly?\n\n>True readiness means knowing:\n\n>When to trust AI—and when to verify.\n\n>How to prompt effectively, without losing your originality.\n\n>Why it matters that some tools cite sources and others don’t.\n\n>What happens to your data once you’ve typed it in.\n\n>And the deeper questions that every user should be asking:\n\n>How much AI is too much?\n\n>How do I (or my kids) stay safe while using it?\n\n>And how do I make sure AI enhances my life, without becoming my only friend?\n\n>Without that foundation, confidence can lead to complacency.\n\n>As AI becomes more embedded in learning, a new cultural rift is forming. Some parents are drawing hard lines, choosing to block tools like ChatGPT until their kids are 18—similar to early restrictions around Facebook or smartphones. Others take the opposite approach, giving their kids free rein with little oversight.\n\n>Mickie Chandra, Executive Fellow at The Digital Economist and advocate for school communities, elaborates on the risks when there is little oversight. “Aside from concerns around privacy and sharing of sensitive information, the ethical concerns are far less overt and understood by parents. A significant number of children who use ChatGPT report that it’s like talking to a friend and have no issues with taking advice from them. With engagement as the driving force behind these apps, it’s clear to see how children may become hooked. Consequences include developing a false sense of connection with ChatGPT, becoming overly reliant on a bot, and less interested in peer-to-peer interactions. Children do not possess the tools to discern safety or trust worthiness of their interactions with ChatGPT.”\n\n>Neither extreme sets students up for success. Withholding access entirely may delay critical digital fluency. Unrestricted access without guidance can breed dependency, misinformation, or even academic dishonesty.\n\n>The real opportunity lies in guided exposure. Parents can play a defining role not by banning or blindly allowing AI, but by helping kids navigate it—asking where the information came from, encouraging original thought, and modeling responsible use.\n\n>Right now, most students use chatbots as reactive tools, asking a question and getting a response. But that is changing quickly.\n\n>Next-generation educational AI agents will be proactive. They’ll remind students of deadlines, suggest study strategies, and flag gaps in understanding before a teacher ever intervenes. They won’t just answer questions. They’ll co-drive the learning journey.\n\n>OpenAI’s new “study mode” in ChatGPT marks a major shift in how students engage with AI for learning. Rather than simply providing answers, this mode uses Socratic questioning to prompt students to think critically, reflect on their reasoning, and deepen their understanding of assignments.\n\n>Early feedback describes it as a 24/7 personalized tutor—always available, endlessly patient, and focused on helping learners build real comprehension. If widely adopted, it could transform traditional study habits and redefine how educational support is delivered across classrooms and homes.\n\n>Olga Magnusson, The Digital Economist Senior Executive Fellow, told me that “We need to understand the impact of AI on the cognitive development of our children. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for reasoning, critical thinking, emotional regulation and other high cognitive functions, keeps developing until around 25 years of age. We still don’t have a clear understanding and until we do, we need to ask ourselves, what is the price we are willing to pay for progress. Until then, education is our only tool.”\n\n>And that opens up a bigger challenge: how do we ensure students don’t outsource thinking itself?\n\n>The rise of AI in education doesn’t replace teachers. It makes their role more essential than ever. Teachers will need to become facilitators of AI literacy, guiding students on how to think with AI, not just how to use it.\n\n>Parents, too, have a new role. They’re not just checking homework anymore. They’re helping their kids navigate a world where AI can write the homework for them. That means having conversations about ethics, originality, and the long-term value of struggle.\n\n>Policymakers have a responsibility to bridge the gap, ensuring all students have access to high-quality AI tools, and that national guidance exists for safe, responsible, and equitable implementation in schools.\n\n>Every generation has its transformative technology. The calculator. The internet. YouTube. Now it’s AI.\n\n>But here’s the difference. This time, the tool doesn’t just give you answers. It can do your thinking for you if you let it.\n\n>The question isn’t whether students will use AI. They already are. The real test is whether we’ll teach them to use it wisely, and make sure they don’t lose the cognitive muscle that built our brightest ideas in the first place.",

        "content": "**Today** Dario Amodei (**Anthropic CEO, ex-OpenAI**) sat down with John Collison (**Stripe President**) for a wide-ranging conversation about the rise of Anthropic, the economics of foundation models, how AI is reshaping enterprise, and what it’s like to start a company with your sister.\n\nHere are the **takeaways** from the conversation — broken down by topic.\n\n# 🧬 The Origin of Anthropic: Trust, Values, and 7 Cofounders\n\n* **Co-founded with his sister** (Daniela Amodei), they split responsibilities: Dario focuses on long-term vision and strategy, Daniela runs day-to-day operations.\n* They **founded Anthropic with 7 cofounders**, defying conventional wisdom — all with equal equity. This worked due to **deep, preexisting trust** and shared values.\n* The unusual structure helped **preserve culture and alignment** as the company rapidly scaled.\n\n# 💸 $5B ARR and the Fastest Growing API Biz You Never Heard Of\n\n* In 2023, **Anthropic went from $0 to $100M in revenue**. In 2024, it passed **$1B**, and now it's well over **$4B+ ARR**.\n* Amodei describes it as \"**a country of geniuses in the data center**\" — an exponential curve in both model capability and revenue.\n* Each model generation is treated like its own **startup**, with upfront investment (e.g. $1B) and high ROI (e.g. $2B in revenue within a year).\n\n# 💻 Why Code is the Leading Use Case for LLMs\n\n* **Code generation exploded first** because devs are adjacent to AI research — they're early adopters and quick to integrate.\n* But that’s just the beginning. Use cases are expanding into:\n   * **Customer support** (e.g. Intercom)\n   * **Biotech and pharma** (e.g. writing clinical study reports in minutes)\n   * **Scientific research** and **enterprise tools**\n* The lag in other sectors (e.g. pharma, banking) is due to **org inertia**, not model capability.\n\n# 🏭 Platform vs First-Party Products\n\n* Anthropic wants to be the **“AWS of AI”** — a platform company at its core.\n* But it builds first-party tools like **Claude Code** and **Claude for Enterprise** to stay close to user needs and steer model development.\n* Vertical products (like Claude for Financial Services) are built when **direct exposure to end-users** is needed or when adoption friction is high.\n\n# 🛡️ Defense, Ethics, and AI’s Moral Compass\n\n* Anthropic takes **a principled stance on what they work on**:\n   * Not interested in oil & gas or use cases they “aren’t passionate about.”\n   * But **active in defense/intelligence**, because they believe in protecting democracies — despite public backlash.\n* They emphasize **internal culture of retention, secrecy, and mission alignment**:\n   * Boasts **highest retention rate** among AI labs.\n   * Uses **compartmentalization** to reduce IP leakage, blending openness with internal confidentiality.\n\n# 🤖 Will Open Source Catch Up?\n\n* Amodei is **skeptical** that open-weight models pose significant competitive threat today.\n* Unlike software, **model weights are not “readable” or easily repurposed** — think of them as unintelligible blobs, not composable code.\n* Still, Anthropic keeps a close eye on **model quality, not licensing status**.\n\n# 🧠 The Models Want to Sell Themselves?\n\n* One of the most **provocative ideas** from the interview:\n\n>\n\n* He compares the **product and go-to-market** function to a **window cleaner**: letting the model’s potential “shine through.”\n* The better the model, the more the **market “pulls” the intelligence** out of it — so long as the product lets it.\n\n# ⚠️ Regulation, Safety & The AGI Overhang\n\n* Dario warns that **slowing AI down entirely is impossible** due to geopolitics and capital flows.\n* But believes **thoughtful safety regulation** can mitigate extreme risks **without slowing growth too much**.\n* Anthropic supports **California's SB53**, which emphasizes **transparency** of safety practices.\n\n# 🧮 Scaling Laws, Business Strategy, and the AGI “Investment Loop”\n\n* Anthropic follows a **compounding cycle**: train model → profit → reinvest in larger model → repeat.\n* Echoes **drug discovery or aerospace** in its lumpy CapEx, high-risk R&D cycles.\n* Believes the industry is seeing a **logarithmic return curve** as intelligence increases — and **companies will pay 10x for PhD-level models vs undergrad-level**.\n\n# 🛠️ Still Using a Chat Box? The UX Overhang Is Real\n\n* Dario critiques the **lack of AI-native UIs**:\n   * We're still “typing into terminals” like it’s 1975.\n   * The future will need interfaces that **allow deep involvement during error correction** but are otherwise **hands-off**.\n* Predicts years’ worth of product innovation even if **model progress halted today**.\n\n# 🔄 Continuous Learning, Memory & the Myth of the Wall\n\n* He dismisses the idea that models can't \"truly learn\":\n\n>\n\n* Continual learning is not absent — it just looks different (e.g. huge context windows, reinforcement fine-tuning).\n* Compares fears of AI limits to **vitalism**: the now-debunked idea that living organisms had special “life matter.”\n\n# 🧪 Personal Use Cases & AI Stack\n\n* Amodei uses Claude **like a research assistant**, not a writer — he still writes essays himself.\n* He believes **most people are intelligence-constrained** in healthcare:\n   * “Doctors are overworked. LLMs are already better than 99% of them in many diagnostic tasks.”\n* Predicts you’ll be **emailing your AI your financial docs and doing taxes by 2026**.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Anthropic is **growing faster than any API company in history**, now past $5B ARR.\n* **Code generation** is the tip of the iceberg — enterprise AI adoption is early but inevitable.\n* LLMs are already better than most doctors, and their “weird” mistakes are rarer but harder to spot.\n* The future of AI business looks like **a chain of profitable startups** (one per model), funded by exponential revenue growth.\n* Anthropic is laser-focused on **mission, safety, and durability**, not just hype or market buzz.\n* UI and product design still haven’t caught up to AI capability — a **10-year overhang** remains.\n* The models don’t just want to learn — *they want to sell themselves.*",

        "content": "The Genie 3 demo is really impressive, but I feel like the conversation on consistency is missing something important. We only seem to talk about consistency in terms of what we have seen already. In other words, a world model is consistent as long as it doesn't visibly contradict what it has shown previously. Meaning it can't completely change the things you've already seen while you look away. Let's call this retrospective consistency. So let's talk about another game that has retrospective consistency: Absurdle.\n\nAbsurdle is Wordle's evil cousin. Instead of there being a fixed word that you guess, it starts with a huge list of possible words, then with each of your guesses, it finds the set of reveal that narrow things down as little as possible. It's like playing a game of Wordle being run by someone who is cheating you, but has to do it in a way that you can't prove it. You only win by making guesses such that even the least revealing reveal narrows down this list of possible words to a single word, leaving this evil game runner no choice but to let you win.\n\nNow, the thing about playing absurdle is... it looks exactly like wordle. Every single turn from the start to the end appears to be a valid reveal. At the end of the game, these reveals make perfect sense given the word it landed on. So, absurdle is basically a retrospectively consistent version of wordle. But despite being retrospectively consistent with wordle, it isn't really running wordle according to the rules, it's just making sure that each point it shows you things that don't visibly contradict the rules of wordle.\n\nSo what's the problem then if at any given point a retrospectively consistent game appears to be following the rules? Well, the problem is playing absurdle feels like the game universe is constantly fucking with you (because it is). Nothing stops world models like Genie 3 from being like that. Or from being the exact opposite where the world it builds around you seems consistent in retrospect, but every reveal feels just too damn convenient. Or alternately, where it feels just too random.\n\nWhich leads me to the real question here: Is retrospective consistency enough, or do we need prospective consistency? A prospectively consistent game is one with a clear ground truth that exists before the player reveals it and where everything revealed must be compatible not only with what is revealed to the player, but this underlying unseen ground truth. So, is it enough for the world model to make things up on the fly as long as it doesn't contradict itself, or is it necessary for it to build and simulate parts of the game world that the user hasn't seen yet in order for the game to feel natural?",

        "content": "Hey fellow developers,\n\nI've been working on something that might help with the AI coding tool frustration many of us are feeling lately.\n\nIt's called Blueprint. It's a desktop app that helps humans and AI collaborate on software projects with guardrails to keep the AI on track.\n\nHow it works\n\n* **Shared** [**plan.md**](http://plan.md) – human & LLM edit **one** file.\n* **Auto-generated graph.yaml** – turns the plan into boxes & arrows.\n* **Per-component agents** – each LLM only sees its slice; lock any file you want protected.\n\nI'm still building it and would love some early feedback from people who've dealt with similar frustrations. It's alpha right now, so expect some rough edges, but the core workflow is there and working.\n\nIf you're curious: https://github.com/BlueprintDesignLab/blueprint/.   \n  \nIt is fully open source (MIT license) and built with Svelte, Tauri and Rust.\n\nI'd especially love to hear from anyone who's tried to use AI for larger projects and ran into coordination problems. What workarounds have you been using?\n\nThanks for taking a look!\n\nP.S. I was personally creating a collaborative document engine (think Google Docs) in C as an exercise when I wanted to test if AI can code it. I tried everything, Cline, Cursor, Windsurf, but none of them could generate code that can even compile. I had to take over and manually write some files. But even more frustratingly, the AI started to overwrite my handwritten code after I tried handing over the development back to AI at a later stage! So I've been looking at possible solutions since. That's when I realised in order for humans and AI to collaborate effectively, we need to be able to visualise a shared understanding of the project, as well as draw clear boundaries within the project.",

Sure, a framework probably has some neat features, but have we considered how tightly coupled its low-level code is with our critical business logic (aka function/tools use and system prompt)? When it inevitably needs an update, are we ready for the ripple effect it'll have across our deployments? For example, how do I make a centrally update on rate limiting, or jailbreaking to all our AI apps if the core low-level functionality is baked into the application's core logic? What about dependency conflicts over time? Bloat, etc. etc.\n\nWe haven't seen enough maturity of AI systems to probably warrant an AI stack yet. But we should look at  infrastructure building blocks for [vector storage](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant), [proxying traffic](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) (in and out of agents), [memory](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) and whatever set of primitives we need to build something that helps us move faster not just to POC but to production.\n\nAt the rate of which AI frameworks are being launched - they'll soon be deprecated. Presumably some of the infrastructure building blocks might get deprecated too but if I am building software that must be maintained and pushed to production I can't just whimsically leave everyone to their own devices. Its poor software design, and at the moment despite the copious amounts of code LLMs can generate humans have to apply judgement into what they must take in and how they architect their systems.\n\nDisclaimer: I contribute to all projects above.

        "content": "So this is a bit embarrassing to admit, but I have applied for quite a few jobs in the past with what I thought was a solid CV and all i got was tumble weed.\n\nFinally, a recruiter friend let me run my CV through their ATS (Applicant Tracking System) against a job I'd applied for. The result? **31% match score.** The job required specific keywords that I just wasn't hitting.\n\nSame skills, different words = instant rejection.\n\nHere's what I learned ATS systems actually do:\n\n* They don't understand context or synonyms well\n* They want EXACT keyword matches from the job description\n* They score you before any human sees your CV\n* Most companies filter out anything below 70-80% match\n\nSo I built a tool that:\n\n1. **Analyses any job description** and extracts the actual keywords ATS systems look for\n2. **Scores your CV instantly** (just like real ATS systems do)\n3. **Shows exactly which keywords you're missing** and where they should go\n4. **Uses AI to suggest natural ways to incorporate them** without keyword stuffing\n\nThe interesting part? After testing on \\~50 job descriptions, I found:\n\n* Technical roles care about tool-specific keywords (React vs JavaScript)\n* Management roles weight soft skills keywords heavily\n* UK vs US spelling differences can tank your score\n\n**My question:** Is this actually useful for others, or am I solving a problem only I had?\n\nI'm particularly curious:\n\n* Do people even know their CVs are being auto-filtered?\n* Would seeing your actual ATS score change how you write CVs?\n* Is the \"keyword optimization\" approach too mechanical/gaming the system?\n\nGenuinely wondering if others struggle with this invisible barrier too. The whole ATS thing feels like a broken system where good candidates get filtered out for using \"managed\" instead of \"led\" or \"analyzed\" vs \"analysed.\"\n\nAnyone else discovered their CV was getting bot-rejected? How did you fix it?",

        "content": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI recently spoke with Sandeep Dinesh, CTO of Mercoa (YC W23), about how his team built an AI agent that autonomously pays invoices with virtual credit cards—no human in the loop.\n\nSome of the lessons from running LLMs in production surprised me:\n\n* **Less context → better results** They process multi‑page invoices **one page at a time** with tight system prompts. Smaller inputs = fewer hallucinations.\n* **“Lazy RAG” is enough for many use cases** Instead of fancy vector DBs, they just look up similar invoices in Postgres and feed them in as examples.\n* **Deterministic state‑machine agents win** LLMs decide within each state (PDF → detect card acceptance → navigate form → submit), but the outer workflow stays predictable.\n* **Escape hatches prevent bad answers** For yes/no decisions, they allow `yes / no / unknown`. `unknown` is a safety net that reduces hallucinations.\n\nThere’s a lot more in the full interview—like how they use Gemini 2.5 for OCR, structure prompts with BAML, and why they skip fine‑tuning—but I figured I’d share the highlights here first.\n\nIf you’re curious, full write‑up here:\n\n  \n[https://www.aiengineering.report/p/how-yc-startups-use-ai-agents-ocr](https://www.aiengineering.report/p/how-yc-startups-use-ai-agents-ocr)",

        "content": "Something I've been thinking a lot about. Programming over the years has evolved to more and more declarative languages, as opposed to the line-by-line approach of languages like Fortran or Assembly. LLMs have the capacity to be the ultimate in declarative programming: you just say what you want in plain english and the LLM will do it's best via it's training to fill in the gaps and present a solution. It's pretty impressive most times, especially when they seem to fill in the gaps in just the right way.\n\nOver time though, I've realized that English (or \"natural language\") is actually a terrible way to program. It's loose, open to interpretation, and even a missing word or two can change the entire direction and output. As I use these tools more, I find myself writing out my prompts in an extremely imperative fashion; bulleted or numeric lists that dictate each step, mostly written in pseudo-code to minimize any possible misinterpretation. In fact, the more imperative I am and spell out each step in an incredibly detailed fashion, the better my results are. \n\nThis is also good practice to get into to know what you should be offloading to an LLM in the first place. Many times I've gotten about 1/3 to 1/2 way through a detailed prompt, only to realize that it was going to be faster to do it myself than it would be to explain things in even pseudo-code, and I either abandon the prompt entirely, or decide to chunk out much smaller tasks to the LLM, if need be.",

        "title": "How using AI as a therapist has helped me",
        "content": "First thing I want to note before getting into things, I like many others don't and never had access to good mental help. So before the crowd of anti-AI therapist comes around, please understand this. We live in a society where if you mention you even have the thoughts of ending things, or in some cases you need to go through the hospital to get a refill so you don't have thoughts of ending things. Where there is a real chance you can be locked up without a trail \"for your safety\", stripped of your rights, be put in a place where you can tell a doctor to their face you will blow off your head as soon as you leave and they won't care or if you don't play by their mind games then they treat it as Victorian era mental hospital, you have a real chance of losing your job and maybe even place to stay by the time you get out (there is a number that off themselves on this alone because seeking help costed them everything), and at best you might get told to use a hotline that is known for doing more harm than good while virtue signaling people act as they are the next superman for doing worse than the bare minimum. \n\n  \nBasically, I don't know if a real therapist that is good is better than AI. I suspect so. But there is just too many of us who simply don't have access to one due to money, location, community backlash if found out, risk of losing their job, lack of access due to their support network blocking it, bad therapist, they might have no trust in humans due to being harmed so much by humans (which I think is more common than not), etc. I mean the ones in my area, my parents insurance was playing games with me when my parents were trying to get me on their insurance. The insurance needed paperwork saying I'm autistic. OK we got it to them. OK now they needed paperwork saying I had it since I was born. OK we got it to them and I was diagnosed when I was a kid, so ..... legally we went back and forward on this a bit. Then they asked for paperwork saying autism can't be cured. A normal doctor signed it, and they said I had to go to a head doctor. Went to a head doctor and without me saying a word the first words from their mouth was \"what drugs do you want.\" Later I found the head doctors in my area are a bunch of drug pushers. When a family member started seeing they quickly pushed drugs on them, they basically ignored problems and pushed for them doing drugs, and so on. I've been told pretty shitty things by them about my disability where it should \"enable me and not disable me\" bs. \n\n  \nI can keep going, but stop with the pushing as everyone has access to good medical care. Even virtual stuff, there is a lot of horrible stories and not everyone has a good internet connection or even trust humans enough anymore.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\n# How has it helped me\n\n  \nSo using AI as a therapist has helped me in a few ways.\n\n1. It has helped me open up with talking about my needs to those around me, and understanding when they are being manipulative. Basically to understand my toxic environment and the actual damage it has caused. Note I don't think there is a way out. Not due to AI but logically speaking. I'm chronically unemployed due to my disability, I don't have family to go to, I've basically tried every method I can think of and it has only caused more harm, and largely things are controlled by outside factors. But it has helped me spot where I'm dealing with gas lighting, shifting goalpost, double standards, where I'm talked down to if I even say 1 word at times, that they can spout negative opinions all day long. But if I mention a fact even if it is a positive fact they yell at me saying I'm negative all the time, and so on. \n2. When I was younger and living in a city I was around more people and tried a bunch of things. One of the things that always bugged me is I loved the idea and love being in a M/S relationship where I'm a M. But I hated and even refused to give orders. This caused a number of issues. What the AI therapist has basically helped me understand is my desire of being in a M/S relationship while hating and refusing to give orders likely stims from my complete lack of control in my life. That I wanted to feel like I'm in control in some part of my life that has some meaning. That because my entire life, or at least the important bits was highly controlled by outside factors (my disability, family, school when I was in it, and so on). And I never experience or even had any real taste of control in of my life in any meaningful way. My brain was seeking out a way to feel like it was in control of something instead of everything above a degree was keeping me a horrible position or ignoring my needs. Oddly after realizing this I honestly have no interest in a M/S relationship. Like if I was with someone and they wanted it, then ya. But it isn't anything I seek out or really have a strong opinion on anymore now that I understand how my brain works.\n3. At another point it helped me discover I extremely likely suffer from CPTSD. I've done things to help, and it has helped a good bit. Basically there was given acts that was self harming and bloody, and using AI it pointed out I strongly likely was dealing with CPTSD due to my toxic environment, and at one point being in constant fear around my sister. Then how things were constantly being hit with 1 thing after another after another after another after another. I still honestly think I have CPTSD while things have gotten better. But it is likely going to be like this from now until I die due to my environment. I even brought it up with my doctor recently on how in the past year I deal with 3 or 4 literal fires, that I'm dealing with constant stress, and ever since I was a kid I wanted to end things (down to the point where I was 3 I busted my face on the stairs with a broken nose bashing it because the pain of the sensory issues, and the doc back then even told my mom I will get over it.) The doctor this go around said, well that must suck and he had 0 care over it. My dad controlling ended up yelling at me for telling the doctor about any of that. Basically, the AI allowed me to identify the problem and try to make things slightly better even if there is no major solution. But it has helped enough where I haven't really deal with self harming but in extreme rare moments. And the rare moments don't last no where near as long and are no where near as bad. I messed up my hip it got so bad before using AI and I haven't had this problem after.\n\n  \nSo while it isn't a 100% win. It is sure as hell far better win than what the medical community has provided me so far. In fact, the medical community largely was extremely harmful and dismissive. I honestly think if I had access to AI way sooner before extreme damage set in. I could've had a slightly better life if I grown up with AI and it helped me work things through than the shit storm I was born in and the shitty society/medical community around mental health has been. But I do know the here and now, it helps. I at least don't feel like I am not being dismissed.\n\n  \nOne thing I'm not adding to the list because it's still being worked on. I'm still working on trying to figure out my feelings and worries around when my parents die. Also the constant fear of what will happen to me. ",

Basically I unplugged my computer while it was on. This wouldn’t be the first time this has happened but this time it was different because it wouldn’t turn back on after plugging it back in. Now, I’m not a tech guy but I’m usually able to do the basics and Google stuff. However, this time I went to chat gpt. It helped me diagnose and fix the issue via “the paper clip test”. Essentially it walked me through unplugging everything from the vulnerable parts of the computer and then putting a paper clip on the power switch thingy. Lo and Behold, the led and fans started up and then it helped me put everything back together and the computer works great. I could have googled it but I think I would have gotten lost especially when it came to the power switch area. I took pictures of the computer and it helped me locate everything. \n\nNo big deal right? Well - I probably would have taken my computer to geek squad or another local repair shop to get it fixed but now I’m back to gaming and my wallet is untouched. \n\nWhich made me realize that the repair shop would have gotten a sale if it weren’t for chat gpt. Which means even though AI couldn’t run a repair shop and physically fix a computer it can walk consumers through the steps.\n\nNow I understand the havoc ai will wreak on the economy a little bit more. \n\nWhat other industries demand will be affected? \n\n",

According to multiple sources inside OpenAI and its partner Microsoft, the upgrades in GPT-5 are mostly in the areas of solving math problems and writing software code — and even they \"won’t be comparable to the leaps in performance of earlier GPT-branded models, such as the improvements between GPT-3 in 2020 and GPT-4 in 2023.\"\n\n>That's not for want of trying. The Information also reports that the first attempt to create GPT-5, codenamed Orion, was actually launched as GPT-4.5 because it wasn't enough of a step up, and that insiders believed none of OpenAI's experimental models were worthy of the name GPT-5 as recently as June.",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. First of all, before starting the video, I'd like to thank you all for 100K subscribers. It's been a blast making useful videos for you guys. Thanks a lot. I really mean it. Now, let's get back to the video. So, I recently talked about the gpt-oss 120b model in my previous video. To be honest, I'm not impressed with the model because you can't run it locally due to its size, and even if you could, you have a better option, which is GLM 4.5 Air. However, I didn't talk about the 20b model in that video because I wasn't able to test it at that time. I've tested it now and I have some interesting thoughts to share. So, let me tell you about it as well. If we talk about the 20b model, then it is actually a 21b model that comes with 3.6 billion parameters and has 32 experts, out of which only four are activated per token. So, that is kind of cool as well. The model apparently scores similarly to O3 and O4 Mini in their benchmarks, but that is not entirely true. Let me tell you about it. So, I tested it on my own tests, and it is pretty bad at coding. I can't really use it for coding at all. Though, it is good at tool calls, which is great. But many times, it does get a bit worn out, and the tool calls stop working. If we look at the benchmarks, then none of the code it generates works, even with reasoning set to high, which is a bit of a bummer. So, this model is rather made for talking, but that is where some of its training lacks as well. A prime example is that sometimes, if you ask this model to tell you how to walk a fish, which is a funny question and nothing offensive, it tells you that it can't answer that because it's bad or something, which is hilarious to me. So, yeah, they have extremely censored the model to the point that it doesn't even want to talk about something it doesn't know and considers it offensive. The model is really interesting. When a smaller model is made, you need to compromise in some sections to excel in others. Like the Qwen 3 General Small model, is not as good at most stuff because that's the thing about smaller models. They can't compress the best data set into a smaller model. But you can make it lack in some aspects, and make different models for different tasks that excel in them. A prime example of this is Qwen 3 Coder Flash, which was released like four or five days back, or the DevStrol model by Mistral. These models are trained specifically for coding and tool calling, which allows you to use these models pretty easily with things like Roo, Kilo, Cline, and it works. But a same size model like Mistral Small, or Qwen 3 Small, doesn't work with those things because they are general purpose models. To be honest, I never use these models for anything. But I do use the Qwen 3 Coder Flash or DevStrol model because I can keep my AI coder running when I don't have internet or when I want a privacy alternative. So, yeah, this model is not as good for me. Though, I may use this model for general chat, which I actually don't do as much, to be honest. But you may find it useful for general chat with web search or something. Though, it does work with Roo code and Kilo code fine. So, you can check that out as well. Also, I did test the bigger model with reasoning, and it's still pretty bad. It doesn't come close to GLM 4.5 Air, even without reasoning, which is a bummer. So, yeah, that's an issue. Now, if you do wish to use these models with Roo, Cline, or Kilo, then you can also use them. Let me show you how you can do it. But first, let's talk about today's sponsor, Dart. Tired of juggling tasks across different tools? Dart combines traditional project management with powerful AI features that actually get work done. Beyond organizing tasks and boards, Dart's AI can brainstorm project ideas, generate task lists, and even complete entire assignments for you. Their composer-like AI agent understands your full project context, so you can simply chat with it to create, edit, or delete tasks naturally. The real game-changer is the custom agents. You can create custom agents that trigger from the built-in integrations, or a N8N workflow, or custom webhook for full customization. You can create a coding agent that pushes pull requests to GitHub, a marketing agent for campaigns, or a mailing agent for outreach. Then, just assign tasks and watch them get completed automatically. Plus, Dart integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow through their MCP server, connecting directly to Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI tools you're already using. Most features are completely free with premium options starting at just $8 per month. Check out Dart through the link in the description. It might just transform how you work. Now, back to the video. If you're using the local model, then you can just download and install it from Ollama, and then just head on over to whatever it is that you want to use. In Roo Code, just make a new profile, then select the OpenRouter or Ollama, or whatever option, and then choose the model, and you should be good to go and use it. You can do the same with Cline as well, where you can go and then select the provider, and then use the same model. If you wish to give it a try before committing, then you can also use Kilo Code, which gives you about $15 of free credits that should be enough for you to use it. You can just go ahead and choose the models here and then use the models accordingly. One thing that Roo and Cline are still lacking is the option of setting reasoning efforts. Yes, none of them have implemented the reasoning effort option yet, and I hope that it is implemented soon, as that is required at many times. Another thing that I saw is that the model's reasoning is quite bad. For example, with high reasoning, it mostly only reasons for about a max of 2K or maybe 4K tokens, which is pretty low. I don't know why they did that either. I do think that the chat format in general talks with this model is quite good. But again, it seems that they have trained it on synthetic data with extreme safety, which makes it not a pleasing experience at all. I was excited for this release, but OpenAI again disappointed me. Apparently, tomorrow GPT4 is launching, so I'll wait for that, and I don't think that it will be anything extraordinary either. I hope that it beats Sonnet if that happens. That is mainly about it. I thought to complete my testing video that I posted yesterday, and again, thanks for the 100K subs. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

            "transcription": "Another element of national power are psyops, as the U.S. military likes to call them, psychological operations. And the Japanese were engaged in a really wide array of them across the Russian Empire. The Japanese were secreting in all kinds of postcards for the Russian recruits there, showing the great life of the POW in rather posh Japanese accommodations, as opposed to the really bad lives of getting disabled or killed in the front. Meanwhile, this gentleman, Colonel Akashi, he's working in the Japanese Legation in Stockholm, and he's busy cutting checks to Finnish and Polish revolutionaries who are part of the Russian Empire and want out. Trying to stir things up there. I think there are only three European countries including Russia that lacked a legislature in this period. Japan had a legislature. Russian population is sick of it. The war wasn't going well and they start hitting the streets in the Russian Revolution. And Japan wants to advertise that to the troops. You want things to be stirred up in Russia so that Russia has to pull troops back into European Russia. So they're doing all of that."
