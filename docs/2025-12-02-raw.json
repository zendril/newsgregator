And it basically means: When shoppers used the AI assistant, they were way more likely to buy.\n\nRufus isn’t doing anything crazy it just answers questions, compares products, and helps people make decisions. But that’s exactly what an AI agent should do: reduce friction and guide the user toward the right outcome.\n\nThis feels like one of the clearest pieces of evidence so far that:\n\n* AI agents can handle real customer interactions\n* They can boost conversions\n* And they can change behaviour at scale (Amazon-level scale)\n\nFor all the talk about “AI agents will transform everything,” this is the first time we’re seeing it play out in a real business with public numbers attached.\n\nIf Rufus can meaningfully influence millions of shoppers, what happens when agent-style systems get deployed across other industries?\n\nFeels like we’re finally moving from demos and hype to actual, measurable results.",

        "content": "People keep comparing today’s AI market to the Dotcom bubble, but the structure is fundamentally different. Back then, the market was dominated by hundreds of small, non-viable companies with no revenue and no real product. Today, the core of the AI build-out is driven by the most profitable, cash-rich companies on the planet: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, NVIDIA, Broadcom, and the hyperscalers. These firms have actual products, real demand, and business models that already scale.\n\nWhat is similar to the Dotcom era is the valuation stretch and the expectation curve. We are in a CapEx Supercycle where hyperscalers are pouring unprecedented amounts of money into GPUs, data centers, power infrastructure, and model development. This phase cannot grow linearly forever. At some point, build-out slows, ROI expectations tighten, and the market will reprice.\n\nWhen that happens, here’s what to expect:\n\nWinners: diversified hyperscalers, cloud platforms, chip manufacturers with real moats, and software ecosystems that can monetize AI at scale.\n\nSurvivors but volatile: model labs, foundation model vendors, and second-tier hardware companies that depend on hyperscaler demand cycles.\n\nCasualties: AI “feature startups,” companies without defensible tech, firms relying on perpetual GPU scarcity, and anything whose valuation implies perfect execution for a decade.\n\nThis isn’t a bubble waiting to burst into nothingness but a massive, front-loaded investment cycle that will normalize once infrastructure saturation and cost pressures kick in. The technology is real, the demand is real, and the winners will be even large, but the path there won’t be a straight line.",

There's a pervasive sense that we don't know when or how we're being observed. \n\nBe interested to hear a comparison from anyone that's been in prison. Are we heading that way?\n\nChina’s Skynet and Sharp Eyes projects fuse CCTV, facial recognition and telecom data into integrated command platforms that can track an individual’s movements across public space in real time (Peterson, 2021; Qiang, 2019). \n\nU.S. cities are rolling out Real-Time Crime Centers that pipe live feeds, automated license plate readers and predictive maps into wall-sized dashboards for “intelligence-led policing” (National Institute of Justice, 2017). \n\nLondon, meanwhile, layers one of the world’s densest CCTV grids with behaviour analytics and live facial recognition pilots in everyday retail and public spaces (Laufs, 2022; Nevett, 2024).\n\nThe uncomfortable truth: AI isn’t creating surveillance states from scratch - it’s just upgrading existing carceral infrastructure and stretching prison design over entire populations. \n\nModern prisons run exactly the same stack: full-coverage cameras, RFID tracking, unified security platforms and analytics that generate 3D contact maps of who has been near whom (Black Creek Integrated Systems, 2023; Tracteck, 2025).\n\nFunctionally, a “smart city” command center and a “smart prison” control room are now almost indistinguishable; the only real difference is whether the walls are concrete or legal (Foucault, 1977; Sekulovski, 2016).",

        "content": "[https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04465](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04465) \n\n\"Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling. Demo samples and code are available at [this https URL](https://lucadellalib.github.io/focalcodec-web/).\"",

Users are underutilizing AI, because most AI tools like ChatGPT rely on a command-line interface for user input that may be overly limited to the user’s imagination. They’ve identified that most users today struggle to know what to prompt and regularly rely on others with more experience to help them get the most of Gen AI. As a result, a better user interface can unlock more potential from AI and result in a much larger consumer audience. \n\n2. Users want to have their own, deeply personalized software, for their own niche use cases. They argue this behavior doesn’t currently exist among the broader market, because building software today is difficult and left to a narrow group of people who are already builders. Wabi believes the democratization of app creation will unlock a wave of solutions for needs that were previously unaddressed by the current app market.\n\n3. Software in itself can be a tool for community and social connection. They are predicting users may find community over an app that aims to share a similar niche need, or as a new way influencers to connect with their followers beyond social media content. Suggesting that mini-apps themselves, can function like another form of highly shareable content.",

I just talked with a very bright 18yo I'm tutoring (straight A student) who asked me if he should go to college or become a become a farmer because he thinks college is worthless since he can't plan for his future because of AI, he can't even know if he'll get in debt for a job that still exists. At least with farming he can guarantee food. I realized that I can't answer him.\n\nI think most of us can agree that AI has the obvious potential of reshaping the world as we know it at some point. How will it reshape it is the question. It enters a world already defined by rising inequality, driven by neoliberal economics and tech-driven network effects that concentrate wealth in asset ownership (where 50% of consumer spending is done by the top 10% of earners).\n\nNow enters AI, a tech that is sold as so transformative that its salesmen promise it will eradicate work as we know it. Eradicating the need for workers looks good for shareholder value and quarterly reports, but what does it mean for everyone else? We can't rely on the hope that it will simply fail or stop; development is unthinkable to halt at this point.\n\nSo at some point we have to ask the question, what if it *does* work? What if they deliver on the promises made? WTF happens to society ? What happens to the people who lost their jobs due to AI ? To the students who took debt to study a field that doesn't hire anymore ? Do we create a 2 tiered society of ai nobility and peasants ? Do we go socialist or feudal because I don't see capitalism working without work ?\n\nAll this while the last peaceful lever we had -- striking -- will for obvious reasons be gone and automated weapon systems that can take care of the riots are being developed. There is room to be uncomfortable about the future.\n\nI think the time for waiting is over. The instability is already manifest in the life choices of a generation that cannot plan for its future. **We need more than promises, we need a clear, legally binding plan that addresses the fallout of AI's success before it happens.**",

However, backprop is often criticised for lacking biological plausibility. Recently, it has been shown that backprop in multilayer-perceptrons (MLPs) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory of cortical computation which relies only on local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs, but rather in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding CNNs, RNNs, and the more complex LSTMs, which include a non-layer-like branching internal graph structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks, while utilising only local and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in neural circuitry, and may also contribute to the development of completely distributed neuromorphic architectures.\"\n\n[Predictive Coding: Towards a Future of Deep Learning beyond Backpropagation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09467) (2022)\n\nAbstract: \"The backpropagation of error algorithm used to train deep neural networks has been fundamental to the successes of deep learning. However, it requires sequential backward updates and non-local computations, which make it challenging to parallelize at scale and is unlike how learning works in the brain. Neuroscience-inspired learning algorithms, however, such as predictive coding, which utilize local learning, have the potential to overcome these limitations and advance beyond current deep learning technologies. While predictive coding originated in theoretical neuroscience as a model of information processing in the cortex, recent work has developed the idea into a general-purpose algorithm able to train neural networks using only local computations. In this survey, we review works that have contributed to this perspective and demonstrate the close theoretical connections between predictive coding and backpropagation, as well as works that highlight the multiple advantages of using predictive coding models over backpropagation-trained neural networks. Specifically, we show the substantially greater flexibility of predictive coding networks against equivalent deep neural networks, which can function as classifiers, generators, and associative memories simultaneously, and can be defined on arbitrary graph topologies. Finally, we review direct benchmarks of predictive coding networks on machine learning classification tasks, as well as its close connections to control theory and applications in robotics.\"\n\n[On the relationship between predictive coding and backpropagation](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266102) (2022)\n\nAbstract: \"Artificial neural networks are often interpreted as abstract models of biological neuronal networks, but they are typically trained using the biologically unrealistic backpropagation algorithm and its variants. Predictive coding has been proposed as a potentially more biologically realistic alternative to backpropagation for training neural networks. This manuscript reviews and extends recent work on the mathematical relationship between predictive coding and backpropagation for training feedforward artificial neural networks on supervised learning tasks. Implications of these results for the interpretation of predictive coding and deep neural networks as models of biological learning are discussed along with a repository of functions, [Torch2PC](https://github.com/RobertRosenbaum/Torch2PC), for performing predictive coding with PyTorch neural network models.\"\n\n[Predictive Coding as a Neuromorphic Alternative to Backpropagation: A Critical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02658v1) (2023)\n\nAbstracted abstract: \"...Here, we explore these claims using the different contemporary PC variants proposed in the literature.

A prime example of this is predictive coding networks (PCNs), based on the neuroscientific framework of predictive coding. This framework views the brain as a hierarchical Bayesian inference model that minimizes prediction errors through feedback connections. Unlike traditional neural networks trained with backpropagation (BP), PCNs utilize inference learning (IL), a more biologically plausible algorithm that explains patterns of neural activity that BP cannot. Historically, IL has been more computationally intensive, but recent advancements have demonstrated that it can achieve higher efficiency than BP with sufficient parallelization. Furthermore, PCNs can be mathematically considered a superset of traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs), significantly extending the range of trainable architectures. As inherently probabilistic (graphical) latent variable models, PCNs provide a versatile framework for both supervised learning and unsupervised (generative) modeling that goes beyond traditional artificial neural networks. This work provides a comprehensive review and detailed formal specification of PCNs, particularly situating them within the context of modern ML methods. Additionally, we introduce a Python library ([PRECO](https://github.com/bjornvz/PRECO)) for practical implementation. This positions PC as a promising framework for future ML innovations. \"\n\n[Training brain-inspired predictive coding models in Python](https://medium.com/@oliviers.gaspard/training-brain-inspired-predictive-coding-models-in-python-5a7011e2779d) (2024)\n\nThe above is a short article showing Python code for making them.

This note serves as a quick, onboarding introduction to PCNs for machine learning practitioners.

Predictive Coding (PC) has emerged as a prominent theory underlying information processing in the brain. The general concept for learning in PC is that each layer learns to predict the activities of neurons in the previous layer which enables local computation of error and in-parallel learning across layers. In this paper, we extend existing PC approaches by developing a network which supports both feedforward and feedback propagation of information. Each layer in the networks trained using DBPC learn to predict the activities of neurons in the previous and next layer which allows the network to simultaneously perform classification and reconstruction tasks using feedforward and feedback propagation, respectively. DBPC also relies on locally available information for learning, thus enabling in-parallel learning across all layers in the network. The proposed approach has been developed for training both, fully connected networks and convolutional neural networks. The performance of DBPC has been evaluated on both, classification and reconstruction tasks using the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. The classification and the reconstruction performance of networks trained using DBPC is similar to other approaches used for comparison but DBPC uses a significantly smaller network. Further, the significant benefit of DBPC is its ability to achieve this performance using locally available information and in-parallel learning mechanisms which results in an efficient training protocol. This results clearly indicate that DBPC is a much more efficient approach for developing networks that can simultaneously perform both classification and reconstruction.\"\n\n\n",

What surprised me isn’t the realism, realism feels basically solved at this point, but how quickly these systems are becoming usable building blocks for actual content workflows.\n\nThere’s this shift happening where AI influencers are no longer a “novelty gimmick”. They’re starting to behave like stable digital identities that you can reuse across videos, campaigns, and channels. Tools like APOB and a few others are trying to tackle identity consistency, emotional range, and lip sync timing, and while none of them are perfect yet, the progress is noticeable month by month.\n\nWhat feels interesting to me is how many industries this might quietly disrupt. In DTC marketing, you already see small brands using AI influencers as a cheaper alternative to real photoshoots. In education, imagine creators who don’t want to appear on camera still being able to produce clean explainer videos in a consistent style. In gaming and VTubing, the leap from stylized avatars to photoreal ones creates a whole new category of “semi real digital personalities.” Even corporate training and customer support are starting to use conversational avatars that look and speak much more naturally than they did a year ago.\n\nBut the real shift might come from autonomy. Right now these influencers can talk, move, explain and present, but they can’t yet think or maintain long term personality traits. When we eventually combine stable visual identity with agent level reasoning, memory, and behavior modeling, we’ll end up with persistent AI characters who can host shows, build audiences, interact with humans in real time, and evolve based on feedback. At that point they’re not really “influencers” anymore, they’re digital beings with their own narrative arcs.\n\nI don’t think they’ll replace human creators. People still follow people. But I can see AI influencers becoming a new layer of the content ecosystem: assistants, co hosts, digital actors, virtual salespeople, persona driven channels, or even tools for people who want to share ideas without putting their actual face online.\n\nWe’re basically watching the early formation of a new medium. And I’m genuinely curious how others here see it developing, especially the parts around identity, agency, and the ethics of synthetic presence.\n\nWhat do you think AI influencers become in the next three to five years? Tools? Characters? Teammates? Something else entirely?",

        "content": "I \\*just\\* got auto-banned from a website by an AI automod.\n\nWhy did this happen?  It turns out more and more websites are entrusting moderation to AI to filter out and ban anyone who triggers it using certain language patterns. An AI cannot tell certain things like quotations, sarcasm, connotation, and other language devices that go \"fwoof\" right over AI's little head.\n\nThis company had steady praise and a record of purchases and activity leading up to a comment 2 months ago that made false claims that it was deceptive and did not provide the services it was advertising. After which, most activity and purchases seemed to drop off. \n\nSo, I decided to do some research and sign up to see if it really was true. Not only was it *not* true, but what they were saying was deceptive itself. I pointed this out and gave a clear statement about how this person was misinformed and that these services did in fact work and provide what they advertised, in hopes it might help them regain their reputation -- even  if just a little.\n\nWhat happened next was shocking. My comment on this was immediately removed and the AI bots claimed I was violating the rules of the website stating I was being discourteous to other members. I can only imagine I must have hit some pattern the bot was programmed to be sensitive, or the bot misunderstood my words or connotation. \n\nThe result?  The comment will never be seen, the company will continue to be met with raised eyebrows. Because this company has thousands of competitors in the same market, the customers will, rather than risk not getting anything, just go to the next search result. \n\nSo if you think that AI will help moderate your comments without the need for human moderators, you might want to think again. This is a clear example of how a company can end up shooting itself in the foot and a rogue AI bot can end up doing more damage than any disgruntled employee could hope to do.\n\nYou would do well to heed my words about involving AI in your business when it comes to customer relations, as well.  One misunderstanding is all it takes to completely wreck your company's reputation, trust, and the other components of interaction with (real) people that make your company prosperous or disastrous!!!\n\nHaving AI in business might be a good thing in some cases, but especially if you are dealing with customers, you might want a real human in there somewhere :3 if for no other reason than to save your business from bankruptcy!   \n",

        "content": "Lila Shroff: “Many people are becoming reliant on AI to navigate some of the most basic aspects of daily life. A colleague suggested that we might even call the most extreme users ‘LLeMmings’—yes, because they are always LLM-ing, but also because their near-constant AI use conjures images of cybernetic lemmings unable to act without guidance. For this set of compulsive users, AI has become a primary interface through which they interact with the world. The emails they write, the life decisions they make, and the questions that consume their mind all filter through AI first. \n\n“Three years into the AI boom, an early picture of how heavy AI use might affect the human mind is developing. For some, chatbots offer emotional companionship; others have found that bots reinforce delusional thinking (a condition that some have deemed ‘AI psychosis’). The LLeMmings, meanwhile, are beginning to feel the effects of repeatedly outsourcing their thinking to a computer. \n\n“James Bedford, an educator at the University of New South Wales who is focused on developing AI strategies for the classroom, started using LLMs almost daily after ChatGPT’s release. Over time, he found that his brain was defaulting to AI for thinking, he told me. One evening, he was trying to help a woman retrieve her AirPod, which had fallen between the seats on the train. He noticed that his first instinct was to ask ChatGPT for a solution. ‘It was the first time I’d experienced my brain wanting to ask ChatGPT to do cognition that I could just do myself,’ he said. That’s when he realized ‘I’m definitely becoming reliant on this.’ After the AirPod incident, he decided to take a month-long break from AI to reset his brain. ‘It was like thinking for myself for the first time in a long time,’ he told me. ‘As much as I enjoyed that clarity, I still went straight back to AI afterwards.’\n\n“New technologies expand human capabilities, but they tend to do so at a cost. Writing diminished the importance of memory, and calculators devalued basic arithmetic skills, as the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah recently wrote in this magazine. The internet, too, has rewired our brains in countless ways, overwhelming us with information while pillaging our attention spans. That AI is going to change how we think isn’t a controversial idea, nor is it necessarily a bad thing. But people should be asking, ‘*What new capabilities and habits of thought will it bring out and elicit? And which ones will it suppress?*,’ Tim Requarth, a neuroscientist who directs a graduate science-writing program at NYU’s school of medicine, told me.”\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/hy4k6m4X](https://theatln.tc/hy4k6m4X) ",

It interprets a complex task, breaks it down, delegates to the right experts, and synthesizes their outputs.\n\nThis mirrors what I see in **Claude Skills**, where the core LLM functions as a **smart router**, dynamically loading specialised \"knowledge packages\" or procedures on-demand. The true power of it, as is much discussed on Reddit subs, may lie in its **simplicity**, centered around Markdown files and scripts, which could give it greater vitality and universality than more complex protocols like MCP maybe.\n\nI can't help but think: Is this a convergent trend of AI development, between bleeding-edge research and a production system?

No nudity, no pornography, no violence, no depictions of real people, etc. None of them differ between these.\n\nSome of these I understand, but others are also lumped into the whole grouping of \"harmful\" content.\n\nLike violence.  \nViolence is in video games and movies all over the place. Some movies and games have pretty extreme violence. The Saw series is a good example for movies, God of War and Doom are good examples for games; very popular games that are legal to own and play.\n\nI've tried with several AI companies and they absolutely will ban you permanently with no warning or chance of appeal if you generate too much violence. I've been banned by doing it with Google Veo, ChatGPT, Claude and Runwayml. Runwayml even banned me permanently with no warning while I was a paying user. I haven't been banned with Sora but I definitely will eventually.  \nI don't even generate violence with humans or animals. In all of them, it was dragons and various monsters. Fantasy creatures that do not exist.\n\nThe content was things like:  \nA group of knights battle a dragon, defeat it and cut out it's heart.  \nA wendigo is hit with a ballista bolt.  \nA giant dragon falls and gets impaled on spiky rocks.  \nAdventurers battle a beholder and cut out its eye.  \nA giant kaiju eats a battle mech, but the mech cuts out of the beast and kills it.\n\nEven still this falls under \"violence\", \"gore\" and \"depictions of organs\".  \nI don't understand what's so harmful about violence when you can find it in any piece of media freely and commercially available, in movies, tv shows and games.  \nI also don't understand what is harmful about NSFW if it's locked to only be usable by adults.\n\nWill they ever relax these rules?  \nOr will they not only remain like this, but continue to get even stricter like they keep doing? All of these companies continue to get even stricter with what is and isn't allowed, and make their filters even more strict and annoying.\n\nI've also heard that the people that fund AI development would pull out and shut down these companies if they allowed these kinds of things. That if OpenAI were to just say \"As long as you have an 18+ account you can create violence and porn\", that whoever is funding them would immediately stop doing so.",

And how to begin your healing journey today.\n\n\n\nSo without further ado I will show you the 3 part frame work.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Money alone is not the answer\n\n\n\nThe biggest reason, so many entrepreneurs despite success still remain unhappy, is because of how they made the money!\n\n\n\nThey get caught up in hustle culture, and they build businesses that are like golden handcuffs.\n\nThey sacrifice everything for their business, and in the end when they get those stripe payments it feels meaningless cause they did not enjoy the journey.\n\n\n\nAlways make sure to enjoy the journey.\n\n\n\nPart 2: The hidden reason you are still unhappy despite success\n\n\n\nAnd another one of the most under talked things, that as someone who has literally helped over 50+ entrepreneurs, I see it as the biggest reason as to why these people are still unhappy.\n\n\n\nAnd that is…\n\n\n\nUnhealed trauma.\n\n\n\nHear me out, I say this because the reason why so many entrepreneurs want to make businesses and money, they do it out of the wrong desire cause they have unhealed trauma.\n\n\n\nThis makes them miserable even despite success.\n\n\n\nThis is why healing is so vital!\n\n\n\nPart 3: The Op system to heal:\n\n\n\nHere is a [video](https://www.loom.com/share/96f45a7628d746c2b9b117ad6111dba8) I made it is a full guide to healing trauma, enjoy!\n\n\n\n💭 𝐈𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝐦𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐫 𝐃𝐌 𝐈'𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐝.",

It interprets a complex task, breaks it down, delegates to the right experts, and synthesizes their outputs.\n\nThis mirrors what I see in **Claude Skills**, where the core LLM functions as a **smart router**, dynamically loading specialised \"knowledge packages\" or procedures on-demand. The true power of it, as is much discussed on Reddit subs, may lie in its **simplicity**, centered around Markdown files and scripts, which could give it greater vitality and universality than more complex protocols like MCP maybe.\n\nI can't help but think: Is this a convergent trend of AI development, between bleeding-edge research and a production system?

            "transcription": "Hi,\nWelcome to another video.\nSo, one of the biggest issues I see with a lot of the automation stuff these days is that most tools are stuck inside their own little worlds.\nYou have an agent for coding, another for writing, another for scheduling, and you're the one stuck in the middle copy-pasting and trying to make them all work together.\nIt's a huge pain and kinda defeats the purpose of automation.\nWe've had tools like Zapier or IFTTT for years.\nAnd while they're great for simple if this, then that tasks, they lack any real intelligence.\nThey follow rigid, predefined paths.\nIf anything unexpected happens, the whole workflow just breaks.\nYou're not really delegating a task.\nYou're just programming a very simple robot.\nThis creates a ton of workflow friction and cognitive load.\nEspecially for developers who are already juggling a dozen different services.\nFrom GitHub and Jira to Slack and Google Docs.\nBut there's a new tool called Pokei AI and it's built to actually fix this fundamental problem of disconnected, unintelligent automation.\nThat's why I thought I should talk about it.\nBasically, what it does is act as a proper AI agent, a true foundation agent that can connect to all the different apps you use and run complex, multi-step workflows across them.\nIt's not just a chatbot that gives you text.\nIt's an agent that performs actions.\nIt's built on what they call decision intelligence, which is a fancy way of saying it doesn't just follow a simple script you wrote.\nIt understands the intent of your task, dynamically generates a logical plan and then executes those steps across different platforms.\nIt's the difference between telling a simple script, when a commit happens, post a message and telling an intelligent agent, keep my community updated on our project's progress.\nThe agent can infer what that means.\nReading commits, summarizing them, formatting them for different platforms, and even handling errors along the way.\nThink of it as an orchestrator or a conductor.\nYour individual apps like your IDE, GitHub, Slack, and Google Slides are the musicians.\nPokei is the conductor that tells each one what to do and when, making sure they all play together in harmony to achieve a larger goal.\nIf it hits an issue, like an API not responding, it can even try to figure out a different way to get the job done instead of just giving up.\nAnd the best part is that you do all this with natural language.\nYou're not dragging and dropping blocks or writing complex integration code.\nYou're just describing what you want to achieve in plain English.\nThis is where it moves beyond simple automation and into the realm of truly agentic AI.\nNow, let me show you how this works in action with some real-world developer workflows because that's where it gets really interesting.\nOkay, so to start, I'm heading over to the Pokei AI website.\nAfter signing in with my account, I land in the main dashboard.\nIt's a clean, simple workspace with a central chat input, which is where you give your instructions.\nYou can also see a menu on the left for things like scheduled tasks and authentications, where you connect your apps like Google, GitHub, and Slack.\nIt's a one-time setup and I've already done that.\nFirst up, let's try a common task for any dev with a public project, keeping people updated weekly.\nI'm here in the main chat window.\nI'm going to type my prompt directly into the input field at the bottom.\nI'm going to ask it to make me a workflow that can take in release notes from a GitHub repo and build me a simple doc summarizing them.\nAs soon as I hit send, you can see the agent starts processing.\nNow, look over here on the left side of the screen.\nPokei has generated a multi-step workflow, breaking down my request into a logical plan.\nYou can see the individual tasks listed out.\nTask one, search for the latest commits.\nTask two, draft a blog post, and so on.\nIt understood the entire sequence from that one simple sentence.\nLet's watch it work.\nThe first task, connecting to my GitHub repo, gets a check mark.\nIt's done.\nNow it's actively reading the latest comments, closed issues, and merged pull requests to understand what's changed over the last week.\nThe progress bar for that step completes.\nNext, it moves on to drafting the content.\nFinally, it hits the publishing step.\nIt takes the drafted content and post it directly to my connected Google Docs account.\nAnd just like that, the whole process is automated.\nIn the main chat window, it gives me a final summary and the direct links to the live posts.\nThe whole thing, done in minutes, and I didn't have to touch a thing after the initial prompt.\nNow, I want to quickly demonstrate the schedule feature.\nAfter that first run, I can decide how frequently I want to use this workflow again in the future.\nNo rebuilding required.\nFor example, I can make it run once again with an exact date and time.\nOr just type my quest in natural language, making it every Friday at 9:00 AM PST.\nIf the repo had a slower week, I can also switch the time range to monthly and save my schedule.\nThis makes the workflow schedulable and parameterized.\nSo I can keep the output posts aligned with my weekly project cadence and channel preferences.\nOkay, let's try another one.\nThis is something I do a lot.\nTurning documentation into a presentation.\nI'm starting a new chat by clicking the button on the left.\nI'm going to give it this prompt.\nFrom README.MD for a project, generate a six slide product overview as a Google Slides deck.\nAgain, the workflow appears on the left.\nIt knows it needs to read the file, identify the key sections, create a Google Slides presentation, export a PDF, and then distribute it.\nFirst, you can see it processing the file.\nIt's pulling out the introduction, features, installation instructions, usage examples, and any architecture notes or diagrams.\nIt also picks up repo badges and images referenced in the docs.\nThen, it moves to the next step.\nCreating a brand new six slide deck in Google Slides.\nThe agent is now actively working inside my Google account, creating the presentation.\nIt converts each specified section into a separate slide, formats the text, and pulls in badges and images to make the slides look professional.\nOnce the presentation is built, Pokei exports it to PDF for outputs and delivery.\nThe primary output is a Google Slides deck.\nThe secondary output is a PDF export.\nThe deck is saved to my Google Drive and shared with my team's Google accounts.\nThe PDF is emailed to my inbox.\nIn the main chat window, it returns a summary plus a slides link to the deck and a PDF link to the export.\nSo I can open either immediately.\nHere comes a cooler feature of Pokei.\nAll workflows are reproducible.\nIn this case, if any day in the future, I need to generate a new presentation file for another product, with exactly the same structure, I just need to go to this workflow, click the workflow inputs, change the title, and upload a new MD file.\nI get a new file with great consistency.\nThe intro, the images, the usage examples, they're all here for another product.\nSo yeah, as you can see, Pokei isn't just for simple, single app tasks.\nIt's really good at handling these complex, multi-app workflows that are a huge part of a developer's daily grind.\nYou can build these yourself, schedule them, or have them run on triggers.\nIt's a proper agent that connects all the dots for you.\nI've been using it a bit, and I really think it's a step in the right direction for what AI agents should be.\nIt's not just about

[ 0m0s422ms - 0m7s752ms ] Hi, Welcome to another video.\n[ 0m8s302ms - 0m17s922ms ] So, one of the biggest issues I see with a lot of the automation stuff these days is that most tools are stuck inside their own little worlds.\n[ 0m18s642ms - 0m30s992ms ] You have an agent for coding, another for writing, another for scheduling, and you're the one stuck in the middle copy-pasting and trying to make them all work together.\n[ 0m31s472ms - 0m35s382ms ] It's a huge pain and kinda defeats the purpose of automation.\n[ 0m35s742ms - 0m50s562ms ] We've had tools like Zapier or IFTTT for years, and while they're great for simple if this, then that tasks, they lack any real intelligence.\n[ 0m50s562ms - 0m55s532ms ] They follow rigid, predefined paths.\n[ 0m55s532ms - 0m59s942ms ] If anything unexpected happens, the whole workflow just breaks.\n[ 0m59s942ms - 1m1s992ms ] You're not really delegating a task.\n[ 1m2s392ms - 1m4s462ms ] You're just programming a very simple robot.\n[ 1m4s462ms - 1m10s982ms ] This creates a ton of workflow friction and cognitive load, especially for developers who are already juggling a dozen different services.\n[ 1m11s682ms - 1m16s142ms ] From GitHub and Jira to Slack and Google Docs.\n[ 1m16s742ms - 1m28s322ms ] But there's a new tool called Pokei AI and it's built to actually fix this fundamental problem of disconnected, unintelligent automation.\n[ 1m28s322ms - 1m29s822ms ] That's why I thought I should talk about it.\n[ 1m30s542ms - 1m43s502ms ] Basically, what it does is act as a proper AI agent, a true foundation agent that can connect to all the different apps you use and run complex, multi-step workflows across them.\n[ 1m44s82ms - 1m50s182ms ] It's not just a chatbot that gives you text.\n[ 1m50s182ms - 1m53s532ms ] It's an agent that performs actions.\n[ 1m53s532ms - 1m57s772ms ] It's built on what they call decision intelligence.\n[ 1m57s772ms - 2m0s962ms ] Which is a fancy way of saying it doesn't just follow a simple script you wrote.\n[ 2m1s522ms - 2m9s422ms ] It understands the intent of your task, dynamically generates a logical plan and then executes those steps across different platforms.\n[ 2m10s762ms - 2m22s992ms ] It's the difference between telling a simple script, when a commit happens, post a message, and telling an intelligent agent, keep my community updated on our project's progress.\n[ 2m23s892ms - 2m35s342ms ] The agent can infer what that means, reading commits, summarizing them, formatting them for different platforms, and even handling errors along the way.\n[ 2m35s872ms - 2m47s662ms ] Think of it as an orchestrator or a conductor.\n[ 2m47s662ms - 2m56s652ms ] Your individual apps, like your IDE, GitHub, Slack, and Google Slides, are the musicians.\n[ 2m56s652ms - 3m5s462ms ] Pokei is the conductor that tells each one what to do and when, making sure they all play together in harmony to achieve a larger goal.\n[ 3m5s462ms - 3m10s952ms ] If it hits an issue, like an API not responding, it can even try to figure out a different way to get the job done instead of just giving up.\n[ 3m10s952ms - 3m17s322ms ] And the best part is that you do all this with natural language.\n[ 3m17s322ms - 3m29s852ms ] You're not dragging and dropping blocks or writing complex integration code, you're just describing what you want to achieve in plain English.\n[ 3m29s852ms - 3m32s762ms ] This is where it moves beyond simple automation.\n[ 3m32s762ms - 3m39s22ms ] And into the realm of truly agentic AI.\n[ 3m39s22ms - 3m50s562ms ] Now, let me show you how this works in action with some real-world developer workflows because that's where it gets really interesting.\n[ 3m50s562ms - 4m13s702ms ] Okay, so to start, I'm heading over to the Pokei AI website. After signing in with my account, I land in the main dashboard. It's a clean, simple workspace with a central chat input, which is where you give your instructions. You can also see a menu on the left for things like scheduled tasks and authentications, where you connect your apps like Google, GitHub, and Slack. It's a one-time setup and I've already done that.\n[ 4m14s362ms - 4m20s962ms ] First up, let's try a common task for any dev with a public project, keeping people updated weekly.\n[ 4m21s972ms - 4m26s62ms ] I'm here in the main chat window.\n[ 4m26s62ms - 4m37s862ms ] I'm going to type my prompt directly into the input field at the bottom, I'm going to ask it to make me a workflow that can take in release notes from a GitHub repo and build me a simple doc summarizing them.\n[ 4m38s932ms - 4m52s172ms ] As soon as I hit send, you can see the agent starts processing. Now, look over here on the left side of the screen. Pokei has generated a multi-step workflow, breaking down my request into a logical plan.\n[ 4m52s172ms - 5m8s882ms ] You can see the individual tasks listed out. Task one, search for the latest commits. Task two, draft a blog post, and so on. It understood the entire sequence from that one simple sentence.\n[ 5m9s612ms - 5m11s522ms ] Let's watch it work.\n[ 5m11s952ms - 5m16s862ms ] The first task, connecting to my GitHub repo, gets a check mark.\n[ 5m16s862ms - 5m17s742ms ] It's done.\n[ 5m18s312ms - 5m30s202ms ] Now it's actively reading the latest comments, closed issues, and merged pull requests to understand what's changed over the last week.\n[ 5m30s682ms - 5m32s352ms ] The progress bar for that step completes.\n[ 5m32s762ms - 5m35s362ms ] Next, it moves on to drafting the content.\n[ 5m35s932ms - 5m44s362ms ] Finally, it hits the publishing step, it takes the drafted content and post it directly to my connected Google Docs account.\n[ 5m45s362ms - 5m49s862ms ] And just like that, the whole process is automated.\n[ 5m50s602ms - 5m57s712ms ] In the main chat window, it gives me a final summary and the direct links to the live posts.\n[ 5m57s712ms - 6m2s572ms ] The whole thing, done in minutes, and I didn't have to touch a thing after the initial prompt.\n[ 6m2s572ms - 6m6s102ms ] Now, I want to quickly demonstrate the schedule feature.\n[ 6m6s102ms - 6m15s822ms ] After that first run, I can decide how frequently I want to use this workflow again in the future, no rebuilding required.\n[ 6m15s822ms - 6m29s882ms ] For example, I can make it run once again with an exact date and time, or just type my quest in natural language, making it every Friday at 9:00 AM PST.\n[ 6m29s882ms - 6m48s12ms ] If the repo had a slower week, I can also switch the time range to monthly and save my schedule. This makes the workflow schedulable and parameterized. So I can keep the output posts aligned with my weekly project cadence and channel preferences.\n[ 6m48s12ms - 6m50s122ms ] Okay, let's try another one.\n[ 6m50s122ms - 6m53s512ms ] This is something I do a lot.\n[ 6m53s512ms - 6m56s482ms ] Turning documentation into a presentation.\n[ 6m56s482ms - 7m8s412ms ] I'm starting a new chat by clicking the button on the left, I'm going to give it this prompt, from a given README.MD for a project, generate a six-slide product overview as a Google Slides deck.\n[ 7m8s412ms - 7m11s122ms ] Again, the workflow appears on the left.\n[ 7m11s122ms - 7m22s752ms ] It knows it needs to read the file, identify the key sections, create a Google Slides presentation, export a PDF, and then distribute it.\n[ 7m22s752ms - 7m47s492ms ] First, you can see it processing the file. It's pulling out the introduction, features, installation instructions, usage examples, and any architecture notes or diagrams. It also picks up repo badges and images referenced in the docs. Then, it moves to the next step, creating a brand new six-slide deck in Google Slides.\n[ 7m47s492ms - 7m56s142ms ] The agent is now actively working inside my Google account, creating the presentation. It converts each specified section into a separate slide, formats the text, and pulls in badges and images to make the slides look professional.\n[ 7m56s142ms - 8m16s382ms ] Once the presentation is built, Pokei exports it to PDF for outputs and delivery. The primary output is a Google Slides deck. The secondary output is a PDF export.\n[ 8m16s382ms - 8m35s622ms ] The deck is saved to my Google Drive and shared with my team's Google accounts. The PDF is emailed to my inbox. In the main chat window, it returns a summary plus a slides link to the deck and a PDF link to the export so I can open either immediately.\n[ 8m35s622ms - 8m44s872ms ] Here comes a cooler feature of Pokei, all workflows are reproducible.\n[ 8m44s872ms - 9m13s512ms ] In this case, if any day in the future, I need to generate a new presentation file for another product, with exactly the same structure, I just need to go to this workflow, click the workflow inputs, change the title, and upload a new MD file. I get a new file with great consistency. The intro, the images, the usage examples, they're all here for another product.\n[ 9m13s512ms - 9m36s272ms ] So yeah, as you can see, Pokei isn't just for simple, single app tasks. It's really good at handling these complex, multi-app workflows that are a huge part of a developer's daily grind. You can build these yourself, schedule them, or have them run on triggers. It's a proper agent that connects all the dots for you.\n[ 9m36s272ms - 9m49s512ms ] I've been using it a bit, and I really think it's a step in the right direction for what AI agents should be. It's not just about talking, it's about doing.\n[ 9m49s512ms - 9m55s222ms ] You can check them out through the link in the description and try it out for yourself. Overall, it's pretty cool.\n[ 9m55s222ms - 10m4s892ms ] Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.\n[ 10m5s182ms - 10m10s522ms ] I think you missed this:"

They're civil wars.\n00:49 - A whole bunch of them want to overthrow the dynasty in Beijing.\n00:54 - A whole other set of them\n00:56 - want to secede from the Empire. Often these minority people\n00:59 - who just want the Han, the predominant people,\n01:01 - to go away, or the Manchus in this era.\n01:02 - Some of these provinces are devastated for generations."
