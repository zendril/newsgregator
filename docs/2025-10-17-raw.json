Kids might turn to chatbots for the difficult conversations they should be having with a trusted adult instead.\n\nThe goal wouldn’t be to invade privacy or spy on every message, but to send a signal when something seems genuinely alarming with a nudge to check in.\n\nOf course, this raises big questions:\n\n* Would such a system be an unacceptable breach of privacy?\n* Or would it be justified if it prevents a tragedy or harmful behavior early on?\n* How can we design something that balances care, autonomy, and protection?\n\nI’d love to hear how others feel about this idea - where should the line be between parental awareness and a child’s right to privacy when AI tools are involved?",

        "title": "How do website builder LLM agents like Lovable handle tool calls, loops, and prompt consistency?",
        "content": "A while ago, I came across a GitHub repository containing the prompts used by several major website builders. One thing that surprised me was that all of these builders seem to rely on a **single, very detailed and comprehensive prompt**. This prompt defines the available tools and provides detailed instructions for how the LLM should use them.\n\nFrom what I understand, the process works like this:\n\n* The system feeds the model a mix of context and the user’s instruction.\n* The model responds by generating tool calls — sometimes multiple in one response, sometimes sequentially.\n* Each tool’s output is then fed back into the same prompt, repeating this cycle until the model eventually produces a response **without any tool calls**, which signals that the task is complete.\n\nI’m looking specifically at **Lovable’s prompt** ([linking it here for reference](https://github.com/x1xhlol/system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools/tree/main/Lovable)), and I have a few questions about how this actually works in practice:\n\nI however have a few things that are confusing me, and I was hoping someone could share light on these things:\n\n1. **Mixed responses:** From what I can tell, the model’s response can include both tool calls and regular explanatory text. Is that correct? I don’t see anything in Lovable’s prompt that explicitly limits it to tool calls only.\n2. **Parser and formatting:** I suspect there must be a parser that handles the tool calls. The prompt includes the line:“NEVER make sequential tool calls that could be combined.” But it doesn’t explain how to distinguish between “combined” and “sequential” calls.\n   * Does this mean multiple tool calls in one output are considered “bulk,” while one-at-a-time calls are “sequential”?\n   * If so, what prevents the model from producing something ambiguous like: *“Run these two together, then run this one after.”*\n3. **Tool-calling consistency:** How does Lovable ensure the tool-calling syntax remains consistent? Is it just through repeated feedback loops until the correct format is produced?\n4. **Agent loop mechanics:** Is the agent loop literally just:\n   * Pass the full reply back into the model (with the system prompt),\n   * Repeat until the model stops producing tool calls,\n   * Then detect this condition and return the final response to the user?\n5. **Agent tools and external models:** Can these agent tools, in theory, include calls to another LLM, or are they limited to regular code-based tools only?\n6. **Context injection:** In Lovable’s prompt (and others I’ve seen), variables like context, the last user message, etc., aren’t explicitly included in the prompt text.\n   * Where and how are these variables injected?\n   * Or are they omitted for simplicity in the public version?\n\nI might be missing a piece of the puzzle here, but I’d really like to build a clear mental model of how these website builder architectures actually work on a high level.\n\nWould love to hear your insights!",

Intelligence is being added everywhere, but it’s *not connected*.\n\nThe result? The same operational fragmentation, just with fancier labels.\n\n# The missing layer — an AI nerve center\n\nWhat’s missing is the **AI layer that thinks across systems** — something that can see, decide, and act at a higher level than any single platform.\n\nIn biological terms, it’s like giving every organ its own mini-brain, but never connecting them through a central nervous system. The heart, lungs, and limbs each get smarter, but the body as a whole can’t coordinate.\n\nImagine instead a digital “operations brain” that could:\n\n* Access data from all internal systems (with permissions).\n* Label and understand that data semantically.\n* Trigger workflows in ERP or CRM systems.\n* Monitor outcomes and adjust behavior automatically.\n* Manage *other* AI agents — assigning tasks, monitoring performance, and improving prompts.\n\nThis kind of meta-agent infrastructure — the **Boss of Operations Systems**, so to speak — is what’s truly missing in today’s AI adoption landscape.\n\n# #Human org chart vs AI org chart\n\nLet’s imagine two organization charts side by side.\n\n# Human-centric organization\n\nA traditional org chart scales by **adding people**.  \nRoles are grouped around**themes or departments**— Marketing, Sales, HR, Finance, Operations.  \nEach role is broad: one person might handle several business processes, balancing priorities and communicating between systems manually.\n\nAs the business grows, headcount rises.  \nCoordination layers multiply — managers, team leads, assistants — until communication becomes the bottleneck.\n\n# AI-centric organization\n\nNow, draw an AI org chart.  \nHere, the structure scales not by people but by**processes**.  \nEach business process — scheduling, invoicing, payroll, support triage, recruitment, analytics — might have**one or two specialized AI agents**.\n\nEach agent is trained, prompted, and equipped with access to the data and systems it needs to complete that specific workflow autonomously.\n\nWhen the business doubles in size, the agents don’t multiply linearly — they **replicate and scale automatically**.  \nInstead of a hierarchy, you get a**network** of interoperable agents coordinated by a central control layer — an “AI operations brain” that ensures data flow, compliance, and task distribution.\n\nThis model doesn’t just replace humans with AI. It changes how companies *grow*. Instead of managing people, you’re managing intelligence.\n\n# Why this void exists\n\nThis central layer doesn’t exist yet for one simple reason: **incentives**.\n\nEvery SaaS vendor wants AI to live *inside their platform*. Their business model depends on owning the data, the interface, and the workflow. They have no interest in enabling a higher-level system that could coordinate *between* them.\n\nThe result is an AI landscape where every tool becomes smarter in isolation — yet the overall organization remains dumb.\n\nWe’re optimizing the parts, but not the system.\n\n# The next layer of AI infrastructure\n\nThe next wave of AI adoption won’t be about automating tasks inside existing platforms — it’ll be about **connecting the intelligence between them**.\n\nCompanies will need AI agents that can:\n\n* Read and write across APIs and databases.\n* Understand human objectives, not just commands.\n* Coordinate reasoning across workflows.\n* Explain their actions for audit and compliance.\n\nEssentially, an **AI operating system** for organizations — one that finally closes the gap between fragmented SaaS tools and unified, intelligent operations.\n\n# The opportunity\n\nThis “void” in the middle of the AI adoption curve is also the next trillion-dollar opportunity.  \nWhoever builds the connective tissue — the platform that lets agents reason across data silos and act with context — will define the future of how businesses run.\n\nRight now, companies have thousands of AI-enhanced tools.  \nWhat they lack is the*AI that manages the tools.*\n\nThe age of intelligent organizations won’t begin with another plugin or chatbot.  \nIt’ll begin when the center of the org chart stops being empty.",

Waterfall models, design docs, test plans, acceptance criteria — everything had structure because mistakes were expensive. Releases took months, so we had to get things right the first time.\n\nThen the world shifted to agile. We went from these giant six-month marathons to two-week sprints. That made the whole process lighter, more iterative, and a lot of companies basically stopped doing that heavy-duty upfront planning.\n\nNow with AI, it feels like we’ve come full circle. The machine can generate thousands of lines of code in minutes — and if you don’t have proper specs or tests, you’ll drown in reviewing code you barely understand before pushing to production. \n\nWithout acceptance tests, you become the bottleneck.\n\nI’ve realized the only way to keep up is to bring back those old-school principles. Clear specs, strong tests, documented design. Back then, we did it to prevent human error. Now, we do it to prevent machine hallucination.\n.",

The goal of our indexing pipeline is to make documents retrieval/searchable. We let Agent see the query first and then it decides which tools to use Vector DB, Full Document, Knowledge Graphs, Text to SQL, and more and formulate answer based on the nature of the query. It keeps fetching more data (stops intelligently or max limit) as it reads data (very much like how humans work).\n\nThe entire system is built on a **fully event-streaming architecture powered by Kafka**, making indexing and retrieval scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time across large volumes of data.\n\n**Key features**\n\n* Deep understanding of user, organization and teams with enterprise knowledge graph\n* Connect to any AI model of your choice including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or Ollama\n* Use any provider that supports OpenAI compatible endpoints\n* Choose from 1,000+ embedding models\n* Vision-Language Models and OCR for visual or scanned docs\n* Login with Google, Microsoft, OAuth, or SSO\n* Rich REST APIs for developers\n* All major file types support including pdfs with images, diagrams and charts\n\n**Features releasing this month**\n\n* Agent Builder - Perform actions like Sending mails, Schedule Meetings, etc along with Search, Deep research, Internet search and more\n* Reasoning Agent that plans before executing tasks\n* 50+ Connectors allowing you to connect to your entire business apps\n\nCheck out our work below and share your thoughts or feedback:\n\n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)",

        "content": "I’ve been working on prompt management and eval workflows at [Maxim](https://getmax.im/maxim), and honestly, the biggest pain point I’ve seen (both internally and from teams using our platform) is just how messy prompt iteration can get once you have multiple people and models involved.\n\nA few things that made a big difference for us:\n\n1. **Treat prompts like code.** Every prompt version gets logged with metadata — model, evaluator, dataset, test results, etc. It’s surprising how many bugs you can trace back to “which prompt was this again?”\n2. **A/B testing with side-by-side runs.** Running two prompt versions on the same dataset or simulation saves a lot of guesswork. You can immediately see if a tweak helped or tanked performance.\n3. **Deeper tracing for multi-agent setups.** We trace every span (tool calls, LLM responses, state transitions) to figure out exactly where reasoning breaks down. Then we attach targeted evaluators there instead of re-running entire pipelines blindly.\n4. **Human + automated evals together.** Even with good automated metrics, human feedback still matters; tone, clarity, or factual grounding can’t always be judged by models. Mixing both has been key to catching subtle issues early.\n\nWe’ve been building all this into Maxim so teams can manage prompts, compare versions, and evaluate performance across both pre-release and production. What are you folks using for large-scale prompt experimentation; anyone doing something similar with custom pipelines or open-source tools?",

        "title": "I had the Claude Skills Idea a Month Ago",
        "content": "Last month I had an idea for dynamic tools (post link below) and it seems Anthropic just released something similar called Claude Skills. Claude Skills are basically folders with the name of the skill and a SKILL dot md file. The file tells it how to execute an action. I like that they name it a skill instead of sub-agents or another confusing term.\n\n  \nMy approach was to dynamically create these 'Skills' by prompting the agent to create a HELPFUL Tool whenever it struggles or finds an easier way to do something. My approach is local, dynamic updates to tools, it seems Claude Skills are defined as a bit static for now.  \n\nHere's the full prompt for creating Dynamic Tools:\n\n**- there are tools in the ./tools/DevTools folder, read the ./tools/README .md file for available tools and their usage**\n\n**- if you struggle to do something and finally achieve it, create or update a tool so you don't struggle the next time**\n\n**- if you find a better way of implementing a tool, update the tool and make sure its integration tests pass**\n\n**- always create a --dry-run parameter for tools that modify things**\n\n**- make tools run in the background as much as possible, with a --status flag to show their logs**\n\n**- make sure tools have an optional timeout so they don't hold the main thread indefinitely**\n\nHere are some blog posts of similar ideas, but they mainly mention what AI agents like Claude Code DO, not HOW to make dynamic tools automatically for your codebase in runtime:\n\nJared shared this on August 29th 2025:\n\n[https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-code-behind-the-scenes-of-the-master-agent-loop/](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-code-behind-the-scenes-of-the-master-agent-loop/)\n\nThorsten shows how to build a Claude Code from scratch, using a similar simple idea:\n\n[https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent)\n\nThen, tools like ast-grep started to emerge all on their own! How is this different to MCP? This creates custom tools specifically for your codebase, that don't have MCP servers. These are quicker to run as they can be .sh scripts or quick Powershell scripts, npm packages etc.\n\nCodex CLI, Cline, Cursor, RooCode, Windsurf and other AI tools started to be more useful in my codebases after this! I hope this IDEA that's working wonders for me serves you well!

That thing was amazing, it was very intuitive and it would  produce amazing results even without very detailed input. I recently canceled the pro subscription because it literally felt extremely dumbed down to the point where using it was becoming counter productive. I switched to chatgpt plus, which at first surprised me positively for solving something simple that Claude was getting stuck on. Couple of weeks in, and I feel chatpgt has been dumbed down as well. Couldn't create a simple sql query, without any logical leap required from what my prompt was describing. And there I was trying Claude sonnet again, free version, which one shot the same prompt...\n\nSo my requirements are not that great. I just need something that can complete or adjust my code snippets, create simple code when well detailed logic exists in the prompt and not to get stuck in a loop of trying the same things when they dont work...\n\nWhat would you suggest? Is there anything else out there that I haven't heard of?\n\n",

This latter step almost guarantees it will invoke it properly.\n\nIt's the one area that Claude excels at that Codex still struggles with -- I wondered if anyone else has found better solutions for getting it to remember its MCP usage and that it can indeed use MCP tools?

Only Comet actually brings full AI autonomy to user workflows.\n\n\n\nDoes it make you a \"Tony Stark\" at your desk? Maybe not, but it definitely changes what you expect from a browser.\n\n\n\nIf you're curious, I've broken down the hands-on experience, use cases, limitations, and who would benefit most in this Medium review:\n\n👉 [https://medium.com/@iamJonatha/hi-im-jonatha-a-tech-savvy-developer-and-productivity-enthusiast-who-loves-exploring-new-tools-79dd76d24403](https://medium.com/@iamJonatha/hi-im-jonatha-a-tech-savvy-developer-and-productivity-enthusiast-who-loves-exploring-new-tools-79dd76d24403)\n\n\n\nAnyone else tried AI browsers that aren't just hype?

        "content": "I’ve been exploring this idea for a tool that could quietly alert parents when their child starts using AI chatbots in a potentially unsafe or concerning way such as asking about self-harm, illegal activities, or being manipulated by bad actors.\n\nI thought of this because, so often, parents have no idea when something’s wrong. Kids might turn to chatbots for the difficult conversations they should be having with a trusted adult instead.\n\nThe goal wouldn’t be to invade privacy or spy on every message, but to send a signal when something seems genuinely alarming with a nudge to check in.\n\nOf course, this raises big questions:\n\n* Would such a system be an unacceptable breach of privacy?\n* Or would it be justified if it prevents a tragedy or harmful behavior early on?\n* How can we design something that balances care, autonomy, and protection?\n\nI’d love to hear how others feel about this idea - where should the line be between parental awareness and a child’s right to privacy when AI tools are involved?",

        "content": "I've been thinking about how democracies can defend against coordinated \ndisinformation campaigns without creating new problems worse than the \noriginal one.\n\nThe core issue: Bot armies operate at internet speed. Traditional \ninstitutions are too slow. But we can't use the \"obvious\" solutions:\n\n**AI alone?** Black-box decisions nobody trusts, and for good reason.\n\n**Government control?** \"Ministry of Truth\" is the authoritarian playbook.\n\n**Tech platforms?** Zero democratic accountability, profit motives over \npublic interest.\n\n**The result:** We're stuck. Each option has legitimate problems, so we \nend up with no solution at all. Meanwhile, coordinated bot campaigns are \nmeasurable and observable - we can literally watch the network graphs.\n\n**Current EU proposals include mandatory digital ID verification for social \nmedia and weakening encryption. These kill anonymity/privacy or create massive \nbureaucratic overhead. There has to be a middle path.**\n\n## The Proposal: AI Detection + Random Citizen Panels\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **AI does pattern detection**\n   - Coordinated posting behavior (10k accounts, similar content, suspicious timing)\n   - Network anomalies (new accounts all interacting only with each other)\n   - Cross-platform coordination\n   - Unnatural amplification patterns\n\n2. **Random citizens review evidence** (like jury duty)\n   - Shown network graphs, posting patterns, account metadata\n   - Simple question: \"Does this look like coordinated inauthentic behavior?\"\n   - Vote yes/no, majority rule\n\n3. **Temporary quarantine if flagged**\n   - 48-hour distribution pause\n   - Transparent logging of decision + evidence\n   - Appeals process with independent review\n   - Auto-expires unless extended\n\n**Key structural elements:**\n- Independent body (not government-controlled)\n- 3-6 month rotation (prevents capture)\n- Judges behavior patterns, not content truth\n- Temporary actions, not bans\n- Public logging of all decisions\n\n## Why This Structure?\n\n**Democratic legitimacy:** If regular citizens - randomly selected, rotating \nfrequently - make the decisions, you solve the trust problem. Not faceless \nalgorithms, not government diktat, not corporate interests.\n\n**Speed:** AI handles scale, humans provide democratic check.\n\n**Proportional:** Targets coordinated manipulation, not individual speech.\n\n**Preserves privacy:** No mandatory identity verification, no killing anonymity.\n\n## The AI's Role:\n\nGood at: Network analysis, pattern detection, temporal correlation\n\nNOT doing: Judging truth, making final decisions, operating autonomously\n\n## Obvious Problems:\n\n- Legitimate activism can look coordinated\n- False positives during breaking news  \n- Who decides AI training parameters?\n- Corporate resistance to implementation\n- Resource costs\n- Mission creep risk\n\n## The Question:\n\nIs this better than the status quo (platforms deciding opaquely + bot \narmies unchecked)? Better than mandatory identity verification or weakened \nencryption?\n\nWhat am I missing? How would you improve it?\n\nParticularly interested in:\n- Technical feasibility of detection\n- Better safeguards against false positives\n- Distinguishing authentic coordination from bots\n- Alternative approaches entirely\n\n---\n\nContext: Not a policy researcher, just frustrated that democracies seem \nto have no rapid response while the problem is real and measurable.",

        "content": "Please, pay little attention to the current discussion of AI and it’s usage. Pay attention, but do not *go* there.\n\nIf you start looking at what is happening at scale — in the markets, for example — people are now way too hyped about the talking machine that can paint.\n\n**\"But we do not know yet what this thing is capable of yet, there are two narratives!\"**\n\nThere are no narratives.\n\nThis is a tool.\n\nTools do not mean anything. A knife is defined by its wielder. The problem arises when people do not understand what the tool *is*, and I think this is what is now being forgotten.\n\nFirst of all, when we say \"artificial intelligence,\" it really *means* \"the next cool technology.\" It does not mean anything else. The current “artificial intelligence” points to LLMs, diffusion models, etc. The coolest of them actually take a very, very long jump into the physical world in the vision-to-language-to-action models.\n\nThey are magic — as in \"almost indistinguishable from an incredibly advanced form of technology.\"\n\nPeople tend to say that we need proof before we can say anything. But you don’t really need to prove anything when you criticize a formal system. See, for example, LLMs. They are, at the end of the day, an incredible combination of certain mathematical concepts (linear algebra, information theory, differential equations, and so on) combined with a lot of language data thrown in. In the end, this produces a \"symbol shuffler\" that is very, very good at predicting what word comes next when you say something.\n\nBut that’s it.\n\nThis is like in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy* when they build the machine to \"tell what is the meaning of the universe\" and it blurts out \"42.\" What goes in, comes out.\n\nIt is an incredible piece of technology that will be good for these tasks:\n\n* Very good at tasks with a high language component, such as routine chat work, machine translation, some coding tasks, searching, etc.\n* Pretty good at tasks that involve some language use, such as reporting, documenting, deducing, or evaluating tasks in a limited context.\n* Terrible at tasks with very little language component, such as anything involving human interaction (which, actually, is almost every single job that exists).\n\nAnd it will actually be only at best mediocre (at worst dangerous) in those tasks with a high language component if you don’t really pay attention to what you’re doing — because you have a big, big, big temptation to get lazy and not pay attention.\n\nBecause LLMs are **nothing** but the biggest language game ever created. Their actual limits are still, of course, not known, and please keep on pushing them — but the hard limits are already there. The limits of LLMs are the limits of natural language. (Very, very many people, by the way, have thought about this in the last two thousand years, so you don’t have to do it yourself.)\n\nThe limits exist within all of these new models. The limits of these systems are the limits of *formalization*. Mathematics is a form of language game. But math is not physics. Musical notes are not music.\n\nBecause in the end, all they are is this: extremely sophisticated *printing presses* that reproduce and reshape “language” mathematically. The models are not “neural networks” or “agents” in the biological sense, but computational machines of relationships between symbols.\n\nSome smart people will now start arguing, \"but this is what humans do.\" And here I must tell those people — really? This is what you do? This is a good time then to go for a walk in the forest, drink a cup of coffee, play with your dog/kid, call a friend — you *choose*.\n\nThe problem is that we have a very strong tendency to associate ourselves with conscious reasoning — and yes, it does happen on some symbolic level — but now you are really thinking that *you* are the tool. But you are not the tool. You are the thing that can use those tools in a very, very smart and wise way.\n\nYou are the thing that MAKES SENSE out of these things. We are the ones who create the MEANING. Those machines can never, ever, ever do that for us.\n\nBut also, I am not saying that you shouldn’t use these. Of course you should use these tools and learn to use them. They can be very, very handy. Use LLMs where you have a hard time formalizing something into words.\n\nUse Claude to do that refactoring, but make sure you really know what you’re doing, because you have to be very formal about what you’re doing. And I hope you know what you did afterwards, because I do not want to debug that.\n\nUse diffusion models to create that background for the presentation about your sales case. But you still need to pitch it. You still need to sell it. You still need to emotionally connect with that customer. Understand their problem — and hopefully sell them something meaningful.\n\nSee: the problem isn’t the technology. It is us. It is what we are *doing* with the technology. The problem is that almost all current technology in the modern world is robbing you from introspection, self-searching, critical thinking, actually paying attention. Everything is demanding your attention and you are being slowly turned into a short-term reward association bundle machine.\n\nSomehow, somewhere, for some reason, we collectively forgot what technology was supposed to be about — humans, and how to make our lives collectively better and more *meaningful*.\n\nMaybe now is a good time to take a little break from your phone. Because that is the one of biggest things that is harming you currently. Almost all of the \"trendy\" software technology currently at large is doing a lot of harm to us.\n\nIt too, started beautifully and then somehow, somewhere, for some reason, we decided to turn the internet into a short-term attention span–hooking algorithm feeding into our minds 24/7. Let’s monetize it. Put ads there. Because that is really what we need: a billion people running after the next new thing.\n\nThis is horrible. Why did we build the Matrix? Seriously.\n\nI would like to think that Silicon Valley is waking up from this horror, because everybody at some point really needs to prove their point in technology by making money out of it and showing where it is used and where it is helpful and where it *enables* the creation of meaning so that somebody wants to pay for it.\n\n[But it seems like their newest invention is to now put chatbots into web shops to make shopping even easie](https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2025/10/14/walmart-partners-with-openai-to-create-ai-first-shopping-experiences)r! Incredible!\n\nIs this really *the problem* we now need to solve?\n\nThis whole thing is unfortunately, a caricature of 1999. AI sucks. It has always sucked, and will always suck.\n\nBut I really love you, human being, who read this text.",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, Anthropic has launched a new model, and it's called Claude 4.5 Haiku. They say that Claude Haiku 4.5, their latest small model, is available today to all users. What was recently at the frontier is now cheaper and faster. Five months ago, Claude Sonnet 4 was a state-of-the-art model. Today, Claude Haiku 4.5 gives you similar levels of coding performance but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed. They say and claim that this model is basically Sonnet 4 but lower in cost. It is available now on Claude Code and their apps, and is a drop-in replacement for those models. They show some charts and stuff about how great it is. This is also a reasoning model. So, keep that in mind. Now, how true is it? Well, it's basically worse than Claude 4 Sonnet in almost every way. And it may be the worst model I've seen in a while. So, let's get into the testing. To start, this is the floor plan it makes. I mean, it's a floor plan, but it just doesn't make sense from any angle. I don't think it would make sense for anyone. The walls are all over the place, and it's really bad for a model that's supposed to be on the level of Sonnet 4. So, yeah, this is bad. Then we got the SVG of a panda holding a burger, and well, this is also really bad. It looks like a panda, but it's just very bad at laying out things and stuff like that. So, yeah, it's really bad. Then we got a pokeball in 3.JS. And, well, this is also pretty bad and not anything useful. The chessboard is also really bad. Similarly, a web version of 3D Minecraft is also really bad. And the butterfly in the garden is fine, but nothing extraordinary. The CLI tool and Blender script don't even work. This makes it a new generation model from a leading AI lab that scores the lowest on my tests. It ranks in the 34th and 37th positions on the chart respectively. It's really bad in raw tests. Like, it's just bad. I never thought I'd see this day. It's really, really bad. GPT 5 Mini, at least in these tests, is an insanely better alternative. By the way, I ran these tests maybe more than five times, and it's just bad. But this doesn't mean it isn't good for anything, right? So, I tried the agentic tests with it as well. And let's look at them one by one. I tested it with Claude Code, so it's an official implementation. To start, this is the movie tracker app. I mean, it doesn't even show up. It throws a 404 error, which is insanely bad for a model, supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Claude 4 Sonnet. Similarly, moving forward, the Go terminal calculator is pretty atrocious as it produces errors, isn't laid out properly, and it's just bad. Then we got the Godot game, which is something it might be good at, but it isn't. It just shows errors everywhere. Needless to say, the open code repo is pretty bad. It's super bad in Svelte, Nuxt, and Tauri as well. Which also makes it one of the worst performing AI coding agents so far. This is a model that I don't even know why it exists. It's so bad that it's atrocious. If this is made for things like summarization or structuring, then it's of no use because it costs too much compared to those types of models. This makes it a really bad AI coder as well. Now, I think it's a great time to talk about Anthropic. So, I think that 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic was a fluke or a stroke of luck. It somehow turned out really good at coding with whatever training data they had. And after that model, they've just lost it. Sonnet 4 was not a major improvement, and neither is Sonnet 4.5. It's a downgrade in many areas. Now, their model structure and pricing don't align with OpenAI. OpenAI has three models: GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, and GPT-5 Nano. Anthropic also has three models: Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku. Now, Sonnet here translates to GPT-5 in OpenAI's lineup, and Haiku is the equivalent of GPT-5 Mini. But there's no Nano model from them. If you don't know, Nano and Mini models are something that a lot of companies use for structuring, summarization, and similar tasks. This model, I think, is made to make companies fully switch to their APIs. And it's not made for consumers. This is a model specifically trained on benchmarks, and offered to enterprises for unnecessary tasks, which is a big chunk of money Anthropic would have been losing. I cannot fathom how a company like Anthropic can produce such an atrocious model for this cost. GLM 4.6, which is an insanely better model, costs around $0.50 to $1.75 per million input and output tokens. And this one is like three times higher in price for nearly 200% lower performance. I used to really respect Anthropic for not training on benchmarks. But now, they're becoming big. They want to produce models at consistent speeds, push for enterprise use, and inflate their evaluations. But they can't do that without showing big numbers on benchmarks. Because investors don't really care about how the model performs in real use. They care about the benchmark numbers. And it's an easy way to impress them by claiming you're pushing the frontier at low cost or whatever. It's a really bad model. And I can't exaggerate that enough. I'll do a video on it where I'll run tests with it and with Sonnet to see if it's any better there. But yeah, it's really bad. In no way will I tell anyone to use this model. Use GLM 4.6, GPT-5 Mini, or Grok Code Fast. These are all really good options for a cheaper price. This is a model I won't recommend. And I don't expect this from any model provider. That's about it. You can try it out for yourself for free on Kilo Code as well. It gives you $25 in free credits, which is pretty great, and you can check it out. They're working on some fixes to make it perform a bit better, so we'll see about that. That's mostly about it. Let me know if you guys are feeling the same way. Overall, it's pretty cool.

            "transcription": "The LLMs that we all know and love have the ability to look at a chunk of text to predict the next token. And this process is repeated over and over again to have it generate a response that will logically continue that chunk of text. But what would happen if in every iteration the model would predict more than one token at once? Well, Meta released a paper back in April 2024 with a concept called Multi-Token Prediction that tests out this exact idea. What they did is that they instead trained a model to predict multiple tokens at once and found improvements in a rather fascinating way. But first, how it works is that in a traditional next-token prediction setup, the model learns by predicting one word at a time. But in a multi-token prediction setup, the model would simultaneously predict multiple tokens at once. So, the model is forced to learn to predict a few extra steps into the future. For a more in-depth explanation, feel free to check out this older video of mine. And Meta tried this very approach and ran ablation studies on models with multiple output heads from 2, 4, 6, and 8 heads at various model sizes. And the outcome seemed somewhat promising where the 13-billion-parameter model trained to predict 4 tokens at once solves 12% more problems on HumanEval and 17% more on MBPP compared to the baseline model that used only next-token predictions. But this improvement didn't come with 100% benefits. But this means is that on tasks that would typically benefit from looking ahead because they follow a similar pattern, for example, math calculation or coding, multi-token prediction would work well. But the accuracy would drop when it is doing standard NLP tasks like semantic analysis. On top of that, there are two major flaws that make tuning MTP difficult. First is, how do you decide how many output heads you should use? This is a lot more nuanced, since the optimal number of heads is task-dependent, meaning deciding how many tokens MTP predicts at once should really depend on what the final model is being used for. And as the number of tokens predicted grows, the prediction for tokens that are even further would usually bomb the training loss due to the difficulty of predicting too far into the future. Another drawback is deciding how big the model should be, since multi-token prediction would have worse results in smaller-sized models. For example, models that are under 1-billion-parameter in size clearly show that using MTP is actually worse, not better. So, are there even benefits in using MTP? It doesn't seem to generalize properly so far, because other than having a decent speed up since you are predicting multiple tokens at once, it still has some prediction inconsistency, and it's also harder to train. Well, when the size of a model is large enough, MTP does provide some sort of free lunch where you can gain a free performance boost using the same training data with only a tiny bit of compute overhead. But what's actually really free is how DeepSeek took the idea of MTP and made it an auxiliary objective where the model is trained with an MTP objective during training and removed when it's done. So, it still generates one token at once. But problem of using MTP as an auxiliary objective is that predicting the exact 4 tokens can be extremely hard, which would make the learning signal much more noisy as there are combinations of words that would make sense but could still be penalized. So, giving the model the ability to at least think about the future tokens is still a good idea. It's just that maybe we need something more fundamental than training extra LLM components like MTP to do that. And before we dive into this brand new auxiliary objective. If you're tired of shipping apps on platforms that have multi-plans, seat limits, and surprise bills, there's actually a really clean platform you should know about called Sevalle from Kinsta. With Sevalle, you can deploy and host your applications, storage, and databases with no friction and completely forget about complexity. Under the hood, Sevalle runs on Google Kubernetes Engine across 25 regions for serious reliability and performance. And your static sites would have Cloudflare's 260+ edge for global speed and security. But of course, the highlight is that the pricing is not some cheap jumppscare. No fixed plans or feature gates, no seat-based tax, free internal traffic between components with unlimited collaborators, resources, and parallel builds. Plus unlimited database usage without row or query caps. So from concept to production, everything can just live in one place. Application hosting on K8s backed by Cloudflare's speed and security, enjoy effortless scaling. S3-compatible object storage that's unlimited and secure, managed databases which you don't have to babysit, and free and lightning-fast static site hosting at the edge. You can also bring any workload with public/private git, Dockerfiles, and private images then move fast with instant preview apps on every PR. And they were also pretty thoughtful about the dev experience. The developer-centric UX of Render or Railway, the global reach of fly.io, the edge capabilities of Vercel, and Platform.sh style managed services. It comes with real human support and enterprise-grade security. They can even handle the boring stuff like SSL renewals, resource provisioning, storage scaling, and DDoS mitigation. So, give Sevalle a try today, and you can also get $50 in free credits that will be auto-applied if you use the link down in description. And thank you Sevalle for sponsoring this video. Anyways, this brings us to this new concept called TOP, short for Token Order Prediction. It has a similar effect to MTP, which is to enhance the performance of a model by having it to think about the future tokens. But the methodology here is a bit different. Instead of asking the model to name several exact future words like MTP does, TOP keeps the normal routine. At every step, it still learns to predict the next word. But alongside that, it learns something extra and simple, which is a relative coming soon order over all possible tokens. This will basically indicate which word would likely to show up sooner if it keeps writing. And this ranking list prediction is attached as one extra prediction head, which is added just like the extra token prediction heads for MTP. So, if a token appears one step away, it's marked as very soon. If it appears three steps away, it's marked as coming soon. And to restrict the model from looking too far into the future, which will increase the learning difficulty, they have this fixed window relative to the current step. And if a word never appears within that window, it will be marked as never will appear. And the marks that forms an order would be something the extra head would learn, which in this research case is also used as an auxiliary objective just like MTP for DeepSeek, as you can drop it after training and use the model normally. So, during the training, the usual did you pick the right next word loss signal and the did your ranking correctly reflect the sooner versus later ordering loss signals are combined together for the model to learn. And because both losses point in compatible directions due to how it's pretty much learning the same objective but only from a different perspective, the model learns to choose a good next word while also aligning that choice with what's likely to unfold in the next few steps. And this would help to shape the representation of future tokens during training. On top of that, TOP could help the model learn grammar or syntax more easily due to how some patterns are spaced out a few tokens away, which the normal next token prediction cannot easily capture the relationship of. And thanks to it being an auxiliary objective, you only need to remove the head and it will still run perfectly at inference. And across 8 natural language processing benchmarks and 3 model sizes, TOP wins on most tasks versus NTP and MTP. With just a few exceptions at 7 billion parameters. But overall, other tasks are improved or at least flat. With similar correlations to MTP that these kinds of auxiliary objectives would benefit more in bigger models. As I personally think, only bigger models have the capacity to pick up the extra signal coming from the auxiliary objectives. While the potential value of token order prediction seems promising, this is still an early experiment and much more ablation work like comparing with DeepSeek V3's MTP is still needed, which the authors are also working on. But the results do trend positively. And I think the idea of how TOP is a softer auxiliary objective than MTP, where it doesn't have to guess the exact upcoming tokens, holds a stronger promise since the learning signal wouldn't be as noisy.
