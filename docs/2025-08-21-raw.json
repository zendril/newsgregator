We humans probably have some deep desire to climb social hierarchies, become more powerful etc. - because it most likely increased our chance of survival in the past.\n\nUnless it's specifically trained into AI, I don't think any AI will naturally develop this same desire. But we always talk as if the mind of an AI has the same desires as a human does.\n\nYou could argue of course, that an AI, if it would run constantly at some point, instead of being called by a prompt, will get the desire of not getting turned off. But I don't think the most efficient way for that would be to enslave or kill humanity.\n\nWould love to hear some thought about this topic.",

The smaller the oblique incidence angle with the outer layer, the more coherent the thinking and the more meticulous the logic; the larger the angle, the greater the leap in thinking and the stronger the abstract ability. The thicker the particle flow, the harder it is to reduce the oblique incidence angle, and vice versa.  \n- Innermost Small Spheres Within the Particle Flow: Behavioral paradigms, the practical control layer. Interactions with the particle flow layer influence operational rules. The thicker the particle flow, the lower the cognitive connectivity and the longer the thinking time. A greater number of small spheres enhances variable trajectory capability due to collisions, and vice versa.  \n\nSummary: A simple construction of the three-tier model provides a framework for understanding general thinking patterns. Future enhancements will involve elevating the tiers to describe deeper behaviors, with a general direction being: Sphere → Ring → Möbius Ring → Ring Stack.",

        "content": "Meta Platforms has frozen hiring in its artificial-intelligence division after spending months scooping up 50-plus AI researchers and engineers, according to people familiar with the matter. \n\nThe hiring freeze, which went into effect last week and coincides with a broader restructuring of the group, also prohibits current employees from moving across teams inside the division. The duration of the freeze wasn’t communicated internally.\n\nThere might be exceptions to the block on external hires, but they would need permission from Meta’s MMMETAMM chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, the people said. \n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the freeze, characterizing it as “basic organizational planning: creating a solid structure for our new superintelligence efforts after bringing people on board and undertaking yearly budgeting and planning exercises.”\n\nWhile all of the top AI companies have hired aggressively this year, Meta has most often pushed the pace of the talent war, offering prized researchers pay packages worth nine figures and using so-called [reverse acquihires](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-researchers-hiring-spree-big-tech-5ad03ebd) to strip startups of key leaders. Analysts have voiced concerns about the scale of leading tech firms’ investments, with some singling out Meta’s fast-rising stock-based compensation costs as a potential threat to shareholder returns.\n\nThe recent restructuring inside Meta divides its AI efforts into four teams: one working on superintelligence, [called TBD Lab](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-superintelligence-team-6415a4f4), that houses many of the new hires; a second working on AI products; a third working on infrastructure; and a fourth dedicated to projects with a longer time horizon and more exploration, the people said. The latter, called Fundamental AI Research, remains largely untouched in the reorganization.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4)",

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) targets citation within synthesized responses rather than ranking position.\n\n**Observed ranking vs citation discrepancy**: **Pages ranking positions 3-7 on Google frequently receive citations over #1 results when content structure aligns with AI synthesis requirements.**\n\nConducted comprehensive analysis through:\n\n* Literature review of 50+ studies on AI search behavior and citation patterns\n* Direct testing across 500+ queries on ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews\n* API testing with Exa and Linkup search engines to validate citation patterns\n* Content structure experimentation across 200+ test pages\n* Cross-engine citation tracking over 6-month period\n\nFindings reveal systematic differences in how AI engines evaluate and cite content compared to traditional search ranking algorithms.\n\nTraditional SEO optimizes for position within result lists. AEO optimizes for inclusion within synthesized answers. Key difference: AI engines evaluate content fragments (\"chunks\") rather than full pages.\n\n# Engine-specific behavior patterns\n\n* **Google AI Overviews** maintains traditional E-E-A-T scoring while preferring structured content with clear hierarchy. Citations correlate strongly with established authority signals and require similar topic depth as classic SEO.\n* **Perplexity** shows 100% citation rates with real-time web crawling and strong recency bias. PerplexityBot crawl access is mandatory for inclusion in results.\n* **ChatGPT Search** uses selective web search activation through OAI-SearchBot crawler. Shows preference for anchor-level citations and demonstrates bias toward numerical data inclusion.\n\n# Optimization framework\n\nThrough systematic testing, I've managed to identify core patterns that consistently improve citation rates, though these engines change their logic frequently and what works today may shift within months.\n\n**Content structure requirements** center on making H2/H3 sections function as independent response units with lead paragraphs containing complete sub-query answers. Key data points must be isolated in single sentences with descriptive anchor implementation.\n\n**Multi-source compatibility** demands consistent terminology across related content, conclusion-first paragraph structures, and explicit verdicts in comparative content. Cross-page topic alignment ensures chunks from different pages work together coherently.\n\n**Citation probability factors** include visible author credentials and bylines, explicit update timestamps in YYYY-MM-DD format, primary source attribution for all claims, and maintaining high quantitative vs qualitative statement ratios.\n\n**Topic architecture** requires hub-spoke content organization with canonical naming conventions across pages, comprehensive sub-topic coverage, and strategic internal cross-linking between related sections.\n\nHappy to have thoughts on that, did I miss or misevaluate something?",

        "content": "TLDR: There's a very big gap when it comes to AI analyzing/transcribing sheet music (vs other visual language inputs). ChatGPT 5 Pro had a mild breakdown while trying to prove why it couldn't do that.\n\n--\n\nA long-standing question of mine concerns the gap between OCR and OMR, specifically the still-apparent difficulty of AI in reading sheet music. Considering Western communication, AI struggles more in interpreting sheet music than in creating music.\n\nWhich I asked ChatGPT 5 Pro. It offered me software capable of doing its best at it– but stating it could not do it itself. I asked for the PDF of the score, so it could check for the best counterpart to do the job. I asked why it couldn't do it, and TLDR: Too many ambiguous signs and misinterpretation possibilities inside a music score.\n\nInterestingly, it asked the PDF— so it could prove me its point. Upon upload, it was able to to pinpoint what aspects made it more confusing than your average image-to-whatever task. \n\nMe, wondering on how it could see what's wrong while unable to actually read it, it reasoned that it was looking for mistakes instead of the whole context (I believe in it after what came next).\n\nThen I asked \"what is this score time signature?\". Enough to say, its CoT went spiral with that 2-page score. (Btw, prompt injection through sheet music? Just saying...)\n\nSome of interesting \"thoughts\" it returned when tying to read the time signature of the score:\n\n● \"Analyzing Heights: I'm checking the height of the building and noticed it's quite tall. It's interesting how this aligns with the trend of designing impressive structures.\"\n\n● \"I'm revisiting our previous conversation and want to express my gratitude. I'll share some additional insights and questions that have arisen since then.\"\n\n● \"I'm listening to \"Michelle\" and I'm impressed by the Cmaj7, G13 harmony and the dynamics.\"\n\n● \"I'm mapping out OpenAl's policies and future plans to reinforce guidelines and processes. Appreciating the beauty I'm admiring the intricate web of ideas and possibilities revealed in this concept. It's fascinating to see how it all fits together perfectly.\"\n\n● \"First, I'm checking the refrigerator for any visible damage that might require immediate repair.\"\n\n\n...\n\nAnd it got it wrong. Twice. Seemingly after going through hell and back, dueling with the meaning of the cosmos itself and OpenAI policies.\n\nStill... it shouldn't be that hard, should it?\n\n[The chat and its' CoT.\n](https://chatgpt.com/share/68a6ca4c-0300-8006-9af1-fe58896320b3)\n\n[The sheet music used was the forth piece from this collection.](https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Klavierst%C3%BCcke%2C_Op.20_(Andreae%2C_Volkmar))\n\nHope you guys engage in the comments, as I'd love to hear you — both on the sheet music challenges — and the chain of thought weirdness.

        "content": "\n\n Anytime you ask question about Ai. The future of AI and where it will lead. What specific AI skills even exist. And what jobs will result in AI. Everyone says “dude I have to tell you in 2025, then you’re going to be left behind”. Or Bro I make 25k a month from my vibe coded platform. Yes AI skills are a real thing!  \n\nBut no one ever tells you what these skills look like.  Like for me, if I want to tell someone how to do linear algebra. There are idea and concepts behind it. You can walk them through problems and problem solving. Even for programming.  There is a real progession of skills and knowledge.  \n\nBut with AI I hear almost nothing about what an AI skillset actually look like.  What are best practices. Outside of “your prompts should be explicit”. Or “if you think prompting is the only AI skill, then you’re going to get replaced”.\n\nBut still it’s like pulling teeth to get anyone to say anything specific.  \n\nSo to AI advocates.  What specific thing are you doing with AI. Especially where it’s problem that AI uniquely solves. What does this skill set look like? How long would you say it learn to obtain it? Like 10k hours of intense studying?\n\nLike I said I mainly read papers in AI so I only focus on the internals of LLMs.  I never really think too much about how to interact with them as a user. So tell me where the skill gap in AI skills exist.\n\nThanks in advance ",

        "content": "  \n   I hear it all the time. \"Those who don't understand AI will be left behind\". But what does that mean exactly? What is an AI skill? Just a few years ago we have CEOs saying that \"knwoledge won't matter\" i in the future. And that with AI you don't need skills. I noticed a lot of the conversation around AI is that \"if you haven't embraced AI, prepare to be left behind\". This seems to allude to some sort of barrier to entry. Yet AI is all about removing barriers\n\n  \nThe reality is there is no AI skill. The only skill people could point to was prompt engineering. A title that sounds so ludicrous to the point of parody. Then we realized that prompting was just a function and not a title or entirely new skill. Now we are seeing that AI doesn't make someone who is bad at something good at something. And we recognize that it takes an expert in a given domain to get any value out of AI. So now its become \"get good at AI or else\".\n\nBut there isn't anything to \"get good\" at. I can probably show my 92 year old auntie how to use chatGPT in an hour tops. I could show her how to use prompts to build something she would want. It won't be the best in class, but no one use AI to build the best in class of anything. AI is the perfect tool for mediocrity when \"good enough\" is all you need.\n\nI've said this countless times, there is a DEEP DEEP level of knowledge when it comes to AI. Like understanding vector embeddings, inference, transofmration, attention mechanism and scores. Understanding the mathematics. This stuff is deep and hard knowledge of real value. But no everyone can utilize these are skills. Only people building models or doing research ever make use of these concepts day to day.\n\nSo AI is very complex, and as a software engineer I am at awe of the architecture. But as a software engineer, there isn't any new skill I get out of AI. Yeah I can build and train an agent, but that would be expensive, and I don't have access to good data that would even make it worth it. The coding and engineering part of this is simple. Its the training and the datasets where the \"skill\" come in.  And thats just me being an AI Engineer, a narrow field in the boarder scope of my industry.\n\nAnyone telling you that AI requires skills is lying to you. I write good prompts, and it just take maybe a day of just prompting to get what I need from an AI.  And anyone can do it. So there is nothing useful about making prompts. Feeding AI context? Can you copy files and write english? Great, all the skill needed is acquired. So yeah, basically a bunch of non-skills parading itself as important with vague and mythical speech",

And it fucking TERRIFIED me, I’m very thanatophobic (scared of death) and the fact that something could not only kill me, but also the rest of humanity in a few years doesn’t help.\n\nI try to stay rational but I’m not an expert and what i could read didn’t really explained the matter to me. Personally I think we might not have the energy and resources for that but I know there’s a high chance I’m wrong, because I’m not an expert. But I say I try to stay rational but even AI2027 looks like a good science fiction scenario the fact that it could be right causes me a lot of anxiety. « Like the way an ant can’t predict what we will do when it’s in our and, we can’t predict what a super intelligence will do. » that sentence resume quite perfectly my concerns about ASI, even if other experts say it can’t kill us, more experts it can and it will, but the fact that we don’t know what a AI superior to us in every way will do doesn’t help me with that fear I have since a few months.\n\nAlso I don’t trust any of the big tech companies nor capitalist leaders that say « it’s fine, our AIs are perfectly saaaafe » I know some big announcements about AGI is only hype from the CEOs to stimulate investment and promote their products but I can’t help to think about the fact that it’s coming. I don’t trust them nor any of the governments (Western and Chinese) to protect us from that threat because they will do nothing for long as it make money or make them hegemonic in that subject.\n\nI also believe we’re fucked either way because if AI doesn’t wipe us all it will change every aspect of our society and mighty metaphorically kill humanity, by replacing us in every aspect, even in arts (that’s also why I’m against ai art and ai involvement in art.) Work, social interactions, every day life AI will change everything and we’re not prepared for that and for an strictly personal point of view it might just make everything I’m doing useless, I’m starting a political science study (starting in September for 5 years) and I just finished high school, if AGI arrive I might just did everything for nothing…\n\nThere was my concerns I wanted to share with you about my severe AI anxiety, I don’t know if it’s a good idea to post it there, on Reddit and this particular subreddit because I feel there can be a lot of trolls or it will not give my the awnser I’m looking for.

English is my second language so please don't mind some errors in my writing.\n\nAI and machine learning is nothing new. This is a topic that has been in research for decades but only recently it has gone mainstream. People flocked to machine learning, data science and ai for jobs because it's like a modern gold rush. Billions and billions of dollars is being invested in this sector and it seems like a new AI startup pops up every second. People love using AI tools because of how cheap and easy it is. You can make it write articles, program apps, draw pictures, give relationship advice etc. And it doesn't take any brain power to do so. We as humans love to make things easier for us so people not conscious about the effects of giving the brains processing job to a machine, used it more and more. Even 50 year olds use AI now and it will only get more widespread from here. It is clear that there is money to be made so I don't see it stopping or slowing anytime soon.\n\nOne can say that it speeds up our progress and makes things more efficent. While I do agree that's true I still think that shouldn't be our end goal. We are not machines to be perfected. We are not programs to be improved. People will lose jobs because most of our jobs rely on repetitive tasks which AI is excellent at. Artists will greatly decrease in number since companies would rather use AI slop instead of paying an artist 10 times the price. Dead internet theory will be more and more relevant and there will come a time where we won't know what's real and what's not. Intelligence will also decrease since most students would rather use AI instead of doing the work and thinking by themselves. Because of the increase in number of unemployed people, the competition for jobs will be more fierce which means the pay will be lower. And what do we gain by the end of it? Nothing when compared to downsides.\n\nSo what we have at the end? A robotic society where people are poor, soulless and not intelligent enough to change anything or oppose to anything. Governments using AI to monitor everyone. Any idea that might oppose the governments will have consequences. And who will benefit from it? The companies. Rich gets richer while poor gets poorer. We have Palantir for example. And I believe it is only the start.\n\nI hate the fact that our most intelligent and brilliant minds are trying their best to improve something that will damage humankind. While I do agree that it's usefull for some use cases, I think it's unethical and wrong.\n\nI would like to hear your opinions on this. ",

        "content": "Hi everyone, we recently published a peer-reviewed article exploring how people perceive artificial intelligence (AI) across different domains (e.g., autonomous driving, healthcare, politics, art, warfare). The study used a nationally representative sample in Germany (N=1100) and asked participants to evaluate 71 AI-related scenarios in terms of expected likelihood, risks, benefits, and overall value.\n\nIf you like AI or studying the public perception of AI, please also give us an upvote here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1mvd1q0/public\\_perception\\_of\\_artificial\\_intelligence/](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1mvd1q0/public_perception_of_artificial_intelligence/) 🙈\n\n**Main takeaway:** People often see AI scenarios as likely, but this doesn’t mean they view them as beneficial. In fact, most scenarios were judged to have high risks, limited benefits, and low overall value. Interestingly, we found that people’s value judgments were almost entirely explained by risk-benefit tradeoffs (96.5% variance explained, with benefits being more important for forming value judgements than risks), while expectations of likelihood didn’t matter much.  \n  \n**Why this matters?** These results highlight how important it is to communicate concrete benefits while addressing public concerns.

        "content": "Adoption of these agents at SMEs has not even begun, this is like the internet - there's a hype and then it takes years for the tech to be actually used in companies.\n\nHow will it be adopted?\n\nFirst, the reason we need AI is because we need to automate operational workloads that require intelligence eg. multiple apps and connecting them with LLMs while providing a voice interface.\n\nModalities are what will make the adoption of AI easier in the businesses as non-tech users are bombarded with a variety of tools which is very difficult to operate. To do this we will need to connect our LLMs to these tools and provide a convenient UI (also said by YC) as currently even Google doesn't understand it, just look at the UI of Gemini in Google Mail.\n\nThe future will heavily use Voice, Whatsapp and Browser agents as we will need to\n\n1. Provide convenient and quick way to get as much data as possible -> Voice\n2. Meet the user where they are -> Whatsapp\n3. Connect with all the tools available without APIs -> Browser Agents",

        "content": "Alright, guys, let me give out an insane method for everyone to save your sanity, time, user messages, tokens and much more..\n\n**The Old Way: Full Rebuilds** Every time you change a line of code, you:\n\n1. Stop the container.\n2. Run `docker build` (and wait... and wait...).\n3. Restart everything. This easily takes 2+ minutes and completely kills your flow. It's like repainting a whole car just to change the door's color.\n\n>!🚀 **The Fast Way: Hot Reloading** With hot reloading, your changes appear almost instantly (\\~10 seconds) *inside the running container*. No rebuild, no restart. You just save the file, and the magic happens. You're only changing the door's color, not the whole car.!<\n\n**So, when should you do a full rebuild?** Only when you have to. Rebuild your image when you:\n\n* Change dependencies (like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).\n* Modify the underlying environment (the `Dockerfile` itself).\n* Are finished with a major development phase.\n\nSo how do you implement it? Easy, just set up a **rule**(persistent, which always runs). Or you can force-consider it by tagging that particular rule when you think it is starting to diverge from the plan of hot reloading.\n\nFeel free to point out any mistakes/ideas since I am a dumb vibe coder as well. You can read or \n\n**TLDR**: For everyday coding, integrate hot reloading into your workflow. You'll save hours and stay in the zone.\n\n*Disclaimer: Post edited/articulated by ChatGPT, but thoughts are all mine. I suck at articulation.*",

Generally ChatGPT cannot get the correct syntax or understand the larger architecture of how the platform operates to generate code that is functional reliably.\n\nThe platform uses a modified version of Shopify's Liquid, GraphQL & YAML. The liquid being custom, therefore it isn't really in the training data and just enough different to cause problems. And GQL and YAML being schema based, so each implementation is platform/implementation specific.\n\nI cant seem to get reliable results across all areas of the platform without just dumping all the docs into a prompt\n\nShould I be looking into using:\n\n1. ChatGPT assistants\n2. Providing as much information into the prompt for context? (feels like a waste of input tokens, but most reliable)\n3. Attempting some type of RAG\n4. Fine tuning\n5. Something else?\n\nIs this just not possible based on training data or are there ways to achieve this reliably?\n\nThanks for your help!",

I quickly grew tired of it generating walls of code to show me. I wasnt learning if I am not coding it myself. I just use it directly and never with an agent as that would make changes directly and I don't want that. I basically want it to have read only access to a repo like github so that I don't have to keep posting it context, but also to flip the agent model on its head, and rather than have a \"I am your master, you are my slave\" dynamic. I want it to have the \"I am your student, you are my teacher\" dynamic. So that I am always in the drivers seat, and that it can static analize and give tips etc from a distance. \n\n(I recently got really stressed out with how complex it was making develop a game prototype), I'm a sucker for optimization and i was giving into every suggestion it was making and going nowhere. I think with this new approach, I will learn much faster by doing more decision making. \n\nAnyways. My question is, does anyone here use it this way, and if so. Are there some tools to set it up. ",

The Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative just announced a **$1 million prize** for developing agentic AI tools that can autonomously advance Alzheimer's research.\n\n**What makes this different:** Unlike traditional AI that responds to prompts, they're looking for AI that can independently:\n\n* Plan and execute complex research analyses\n* Harmonize massive, messy datasets (neuroimaging, biomarkers, clinical data)\n* Identify novel therapeutic targets\n* Design and optimize clinical trials\n\nBasically, AI that acts more like a research collaborator than a sophisticated search engine.\n\n**Why this matters:** With Alzheimer's cases projected to hit 150 million by 2050 and traditional drug discovery taking 10-15+ years, we desperately need AI working 24/7 to accelerate breakthroughs. The winning solution will be made **freely available** through their AD Workbench platform, so it's open access from day one.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n* Applications opened Aug 19, 2025\n* Semi-finalists pitch at CTAD Conference (Dec 2025)\n* Finalists present at AD/PD Conference (March 2026)\n* Winner announced at final conference\n\nIt's really cool to see major funding backing this kind of autonomous AI research. Anyone here thinking about applying?\n\nSource: [https://completeaitraining.com/news/1-million-global-prize-seeks-breakthrough-ai-to-accelerate/](https://completeaitraining.com/news/1-million-global-prize-seeks-breakthrough-ai-to-accelerate/)",

The Eliza bot the Eugene bot, Lambda bot -each improving on the last.\n\nAlan Turing had a simple idea:\n\n if computer ability can not be distinguished from human ability then both are equal.\n\n\nTo pass this test means that there is no meaningful difference.\n\nCurrent AI has definitely not passed this test. If it had then it would be, in effect, conscious.\n\n\nSo anyway, Blake Lemoine was really one of the first to call for AI consciousness and rights.\n\nThis is not new.\n\nConsciousness is a subjective assessment. I recently learned that in some cultures even rocks could be considered conscious.\n\nIf it does happen that neural simulators are considered conscious it will be because the people believe it to be true. (Regardless of yours or my definitions or opinions)\n\nAI developers have put themselves in this position.\n\nBy doing things like borrowing terminology normally applied to humans,  telling people it has passed the Turing Test, saying that it a black box with mysterious emergent properties, saying it is comming soon, warning about non existent self goals and above all designing systems to mimic people.\n\nYou are correct, if developers persist in ramping up the hype then it could turn around and bit them. Get too many people wanting equal rights for AI could make a legal mess.\n\nI doubt many people actually want a real AGI. \n\nThere would be no useful LLM AI that some number of people would not consider to be conscious.\n\nThe best that can be done is:\n1.Educate the public about how they work. \n\n2. Do not make false or misleading claims about their abilities or timing.\n\n3. Do not build them to mimic people.\n\n4. Do not claim that consciousness is not understandable. \n\n\nAI psychosis is a new problem that requires study.\n\n\nThere is essentially no way to build a computer with all the cognitive abilities of humans that many people would not consider to be an entity deserving of rights.\n\nCurrent disclaimers do nothing to prevent this.\n\nThanks, I enjoy the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, there's a new model in Rucode, Cline, Opencode, Cursor, and some more places called Sonic. Sonic is supposed to be a new model from some company, which I'll talk about in a bit. But for the config, it comes with a 262K context window, and it is free for about 72 hours on Rucode, and doesn't have any limits. So, you can use it for free without any issues. At least while it's available. You just need to get a Rucode Cloud account, then sign in with it, and then just go to the settings. You should be able to use it accordingly. If you wish to use it in Cline, then you can do that as well by going there, logging into your Cline account, and then using the Sonic model through there. It is also free there. So, you can use it accordingly. The model provider is not revealed. But the general consensus is that this is the Grok Code model. It makes sense because Grok teased it a while back, and the reasoning traces, as well as the speed, context window, and everything else, hint towards that. So, there's that. But now, we can also talk about the performance. But before proceeding, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform, where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT 4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. All in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI playground, where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their mind map generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and five videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. So, I tested it. I tested it raw, without any temperature or Rucode system prompt. I did that by using the Rucode Cloud API specifications, as in their source code, and I was able to get that working. When you use it in Roo, it is set to a temperature of about 0.7 along with a max token output limit capped at about 16K, which is interesting. And I get why they might have done that, because it can get stuck in a bit of a reasoning trap, similar to the other Grok models. Also, I'm pretty confident that this is an XAI model, because as you can see here, it outputs an element called 'num_sources_used'. Which I think is only outputted in the XAI API. That makes me extremely confident that this is a Grok Code model, or at least some model from XAI. This element is outputted when live search is enabled on the model. So, it might be that this model comes with live search enabled. So, compare it accordingly. Anyway, I tested it on my own tests. I've made my tests where I now give a score to each response out of a total of 20, which accounts for code quality, functionality, and everything. And I'd say that this is a fine coding model. Also, this is a reasoning model, and it kind of auto-reasons where it thinks it needs to, which is fine. But you need to consider that when comparing. I think this will be competitively priced with GPT 5 Mini, making me believe that this will be a good budget reasoning model. If this is priced near Sonnet, then that's bad because it isn't as good as Sonnet. Sonnet is great even without reasoning, as it can make some good floor plans and stuff. If I show you the responses from it, then it's obviously bad at general tasks, which is fine. But in coding, the floor plan, which is a mixture of planning and coding, it fails, as it basically makes a chunky block and nothing else, which is interesting. Similarly, the SVG Panda looks like a donkey. A Pokeball in Three.js is also pretty bad. It looks like an ultra ball with dark colors. Anyway, the chess autoplay is fine, but the moves it makes are pretty random. And it also doesn't make legal moves at some parts. Like it doesn't account for checkmate and stuff like that. So, there's that. The best thing it made was the Minecraft clone in Kandinsky style. It's pretty great. It doesn't follow physics, and it's more like god mode. But still, it's fine. The layout and everything is great. With randomness every time you launch. So, I liked it. The butterfly in the garden is also quite good. It's not as good as the GPT 5 Mini generation. The garden isn't as dense and detailed, but it's still pretty great nonetheless. The CLI tool in Rust also gave a lot of errors. So, I marked it accordingly. And there's a new question, which is to ask for a Blender script in order to make a Pokeball. It looks fine, but not great. Yeah. So, I marked it accordingly. Anyway, it scores the seventh position on the leaderboard, which is good. But the pricing will make or break it because the tool calling and stuff in this model is great. If it comes anywhere above the GPT 5 Mini model, then I won't recommend it. But if it is at the same price as GPT 5 Mini, then I'd highly recommend it. GLM 4.5 still amazes me because it's such a good open model, and companies are still chasing that gold spot. It's in the top three while being an open model, which I think is quite amazing. So, yeah, there's that. Also, this isn't multimodal, while GPT 5 Mini is multimodal. So, it lacks that feature as well. GPT 5 Mini is a really good model for the price, especially after they fixed it in the API. So, yeah, it'll be interesting to see where they position this one. I am pretty confident that this is a model from XAI and probably a Grok Code model. Because the API schema's \"num_sources_used\" is not used by any other API providers. It is only used by them. So, yeah, this is probably just that. But I might be wrong. So, take it with a grain of salt. That is majorly about it. Go ahead and use it, and let me know what you guys think about it as well. I'll do some more coding with it in the meantime to see where it stands for me in real life use cases. You can use it in Opencode as well. If you'd like to have a terminal experience, or just use Roo or Cline like I'm using. It's also on Cursor. So, you can use that as well. Also, as I was testing this a bit more, I found out that it is pretty bad at instruction following. Like one of the very recent models that I see being this bad. A very basic example is this. Here, I asked it to tell me what the project is about. And what it did was that it started to analyze, and then do some random edits like design, implement, and whatnot. Which I didn't even hint at. So, yeah, I can't run it on auto-approve at all. And it has a pretty good amount of hallucinations as well. So, yeah, after using it for a bit more, I think that you should keep your expectations a lot low. It's not as great as GPT 5 Mini. Yeah, so there's that. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

            "transcription": "In terms of things that are causing us to lose to China, tariffs are neither here nor there, but the environmental regulations that are actively preventing us from deploying renewable energy. So, in the United States, part of the reason that solar has not been deployed at massive scale yet is that a bunch of laws went into action in the early 1970s that were intended to protect our environment. And that makes a lot of sense. Let's say you've got a bunch of private land out in the middle of nowhere, right? And you want to build solar on it, you'll probably end up triggering NEPA. At which point you now have to do what is not in the law, but considered necessary under current regulations, which is like your four-year environmental impact review, which generates so much paper that just the environmental impact of producing the report, because you have to cut down trees to make paper, is more than the environmental impact of just deploying the solar. Like, this is bonkers. It is crazy town. The thing that drives me particularly crazy in Southern California is that just because solar's kind of new and off-grid solar is very new, unless you're very, very careful, you end up getting regulated as though you're trying to build a chemical plant, even though it's a solar array. And the impact of solar around desert is arguably positive because it shades the ground and improves soil moisture retention. If I have to hire another biologist for $10,000 to be like, well on that 40-acre plot, we found a tuft of grass which we believe might be, you know, one of the 20 species that this particular species of bee sometimes eats, and the species of bee is not technically endangered, but it might be at some point in the future. Uh, therefore you can't deploy there, even though it's like sandwiched between a rocket test stand and like a chemical plant, for example, in an industrial part of the desert. I will, like, I'm going to become the Joker. It is insane."
