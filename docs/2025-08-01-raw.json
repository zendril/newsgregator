        "content": "[Will your job survive AI?](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/07/will-your-job-survive-ai/) (Harvard Gazette)\n\nChristina Pazzanese\n\nHarvard Staff Writer\n\nJuly 29, 2025  \n\n\nExpert on future of work says it’s a little early for dire predictions, but there are signs significant change may be coming\n\nIn recent weeks, several prominent executives at big employers such as Ford and J.P. Morgan Chase have been offering predictions that AI will result in large white-collar job losses.\n\nSome tech leaders, including those at Amazon, OpenAI, and Meta have acknowledged that the latest wave of AI, called agentic AI, is much closer to radically transforming the workplace than even they had previously anticipated.\n\nDario Amodei, chief executive of AI firm Anthropic, said nearly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in tech, finance, law, and consulting could be replaced or eliminated by AI.\n\nChristopher Stanton, Marvin Bower Associate Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School, studies AI in the workplace and teaches an MBA course, “Managing the Future of Work.” In this edited conversation, Stanton explains why the latest generation of AI is evolving so rapidly and how it may shake up white-collar work.\n\n**Several top executives are now predicting AI will eliminate large numbers of white-collar jobs far sooner than previously expected. Does that sound accurate?**\n\nI think it’s too early to tell. If you were pessimistic in the sense that you’re worried about labor market disruption and skill and human capital depreciation, if you look at the tasks that workers in white-collar work can do and what we think AI is capable of, that overlap impacts about 35 percent of the tasks that we see in labor market data.\n\nThe optimistic case is that if you think a machine can do some tasks but not all, the tasks the machine can automate or do will free up people to concentrate on different aspects of a job. It might be that you would see 20 percent or 30 percent of the tasks that a professor could do being done by AI, but the other 80 percent or 70 percent are things that might be complementary to what an AI might produce. Those are the two extremes.\n\nIn practice, it’s probably still too early to tell how this is going to shake out, but we’ve seen at least three or four things that might lead you to suspect that the view that AI is going to have a more disruptive effect on the labor market might be reasonable.\n\nOne of those is that computer-science graduates and STEM graduates in general are having more trouble finding jobs today than in the past, which might be consistent with the view that AI is doing a lot of work that, say, software engineers used to do.\n\nIf you look at reports out of, say, Y Combinator or if you look at reports out of other tech sector-focused places, it looks like a lot of the code for early-stage startups is now being written by AI. Four or five years ago, that wouldn’t have been true at all. So, we are starting to see the uptake of these tools consistent with the narrative from these CEOs. So that’s one piece of it.\n\nThe second piece is that even if you don’t necessarily think of displacement, you can potentially think that AI is going to have an impact on wages.\n\nThere are two competing ways of thinking about where this is going to go. Some of the early evidence that looks at AI rollouts and contact centers and frontline work and the like suggests that AI reduces inequality between people by lifting the lower tail of performers.\n\nSome of the best papers on this look at the randomized rollout of conversational AI tools or chatbots and frontline call-center work and show that lower-performing workers or workers who are at the bottom of the productivity distribution disproportionately benefit from that AI rollout tool. If these workers have knowledge gaps, the AIs fill in for the knowledge gaps.\n\n**What’s driving the accelerated speed at which this generation of AI is evolving and being used by businesses?**\n\nThere are a couple of things. I have a paper with some researchers at Microsoft that looks at AI adoption in the workplace and the effects of AI rollout. Our tentative conclusion was that it took a lot of coordination to really see some of the productivity effects of AI, but it had an immediate impact on individual tasks like email.\n\nOne of the messages in that paper that has not necessarily been widely diffused is that this is probably some of the fastest-diffusing technology around.\n\nIn our sample, half of the participants who got access to this tool from Microsoft were using it. And so, the take-up has been tremendous.\n\nMy guess is that one of the reasons why the executives … didn’t forecast this is that this is an extraordinarily fast-diffusing technology. You’re seeing different people in different teams running their own experiments to figure out how to use it, and some of those experiments are going to generate insights that weren’t anticipated.\n\nThe second thing that has accelerated the usefulness of these models is a type of model called a chain-of-thought model. The earliest versions of generative AI tools were prone to hallucinate and to provide answers that were inaccurate. The chain-of-thought type of reasoning is meant to do error correction on the fly.\n\nAnd so, rather than provide an answer that could be subject to error or hallucinations, the model itself will provide a prompt to say, “Are you sure about that? Double check.” Models with chain-of-thought reasoning are much, much more accurate and less subject to hallucinations, especially for quantitative tasks or tasks that involve programming.\n\nAs a result, you are seeing quite a lot of penetration with early stage startups who are doing coding using natural-language queries or what they call “vibe coding” today. These vibe-coding tools have some built-in error correction where you can actually write usable code as a result of these feedback mechanisms that model designers have built in.\n\nThe third thing driving major adoption, especially in the tech world, is that model providers have built tools to deploy code. Anthropic has a tool that will allow you to write code just based on queries or natural language, and then you can deploy that with Anthropic tools.\n\nThere are other tools like Cursor or Replika where you will ultimately be able to instruct a machine to write pieces of technical software with limited technical background. You don’t necessarily need specific technical tools, and it’s made deployment much, much easier.\n\nThis feeds back into the thing that I was telling you earlier, which is that you’ve seen lots of experiments and you’ve seen enormous diffusion. And one of the reasons that you’ve seen enormous diffusion is that you now have these tools and these models that allow people without domain expertise to build things and figure out what they can build and how they can do it.\n\n**Which types of work are most likely to see change first, and in what way? You mentioned writing code, but are there others?**\n\nI have not seen any of the immediate data that suggests employment losses, but you could easily imagine that in any knowledge work you might see some employment effects, at least in theory.\n\nIn practice, if you look back at the history of predictions about AI and job loss, making those predictions is extraordinarily hard.\n\nWe had lots of discussion in 2017, 2018, 2019, around whether we should stop training radiologists. But radiologists are as busy as ever and we didn’t stop training them. They’re doing more and one of the reasons is that the cost of imaging has fallen. And at least some of them have some AI tools at their fingertips.\n\nAnd so, in some sense, these tools are going to potentially take some tasks that humans were doing but also lower the cost of doing new things. And so, the net-net of that is very hard to predict, because if you do something that augments something that is complementary to what humans in those occupations are doing, you may need more humans doing slightly different tasks.\n\nAnd so, I think it’s too early to say that we’re going to necessarily see a net displacement in any one industry or overall.\n\n**If AI suddenly puts a large portion of middle-class Americans out of work or makes their education and skills far less valuable, that could have catastrophic effects on the U.S. economy, on politics, and on quality of life generally. Are there any policy solutions lawmakers should be thinking about today to get ahead of this sea change?**\n\nMy personal inclination — this is not necessarily based on a deep analytical model — is that policymakers will have a very limited ability to do anything here unless it’s through subsidies or tax policy. Anything that you would do to prop up employment, you’ll see a competitor who is more nimble and with a lower cost who doesn’t have that same legacy labor stack probably out-compete people dynamically.\n\nIt’s not so clear that there should be any policy intervention when we don’t necessarily understand the technology at this point. My guess is that the policymakers’ remedy is going to be an ex-post one rather than an ex-ante one. My suspicion is better safety-net policies and better retraining policies will be the tools at play rather than trying to prevent the adoption of the technology.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n",

Dr. David Wood discusses “America’s AI Action Plan”.\n\nFULL INTERVIEW LINK: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChNRkGhVXro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChNRkGhVXro)\n\n  \nOn July 23, the White House released “America’s AI Action Plan” along with three Executive Orders addressing AI development, federal procurement, and infrastructure. The President said, \"My administration will use every tool at our disposal to ensure the United States can build and maintain the largest and most powerful AI infrastructure on the planet.\"   \n  \nThe 25-page AI Action Plan focuses on bolstering American AI dominance through deregulation, ideologically neutral AI systems, infrastructure investment, and international competition. This will fast-track Federal permitting, streamline reviews, and expedite construction of AI infrastructure projects.  \n  \nWhite House AI & crypto Czar David Sacks spoke on CNBC and mentioned Huawei's development of an AI \"Cloud Matrix\", and Nvidia's decision to start selling chips to China, and stated that \"unless America competes we're effectively subsidizing China's efforts by giving them market share, revenue for R&D, and creating a developer ecosystem for them.\" In other words, he's saying AI is a race that can be lost.  \n  \nIs the administration launching a global AI race, similar to US/USSR nuclear arms race in the cold war - or is this merely an acknowlegement of existing trends? Trump himself said progress is going to go so fast, that \"you're going to say wait a minute, this is too fast\". He's also said, \"as with any such breakthrough, this technology brings with it the potential for bad as well as for good, for peril as well as for progress\".  \n  \nOur discussion includes not only the Action Plan and Executive Orders, but also explores on AI safety, The Singularity, economic impacts, and US competition with China.  \n  \nDr. David Wood is a well-known futurist, author, singularitarian, and chair of the London Futurists.  \n  \nDr. Wood has an MA in Mathematics, graduate studies in the Philosophy of Science from the University of Cambridge, an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Westminster, and over 30 years of experience in the technology industry.  \n  \nAs a futurist, Dr. Wood has served as the Co-Founder of Transhumanist UK, Executive Director of Transpolitica, Node Co-Chair of The Millennium Project, Fellow at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and his current role as Principal at Delta Wisdom. He also holds board positions at SingularityNet, Sustensis, the LEV Foundation, and is a former board member of Humanity Plus.  \n  \nDavid is the author of 13 books, and is one of the T3's \"100 most influential people in technology\". His focus is on radical transformation in society and humanity enabled by technological disruption.",

The prompt I used was: \"What are the best Android phones right now?\"\n\nThey all gave me a list of phones, but they left out very powerful Chinese phones like the Oppo Find X8 Ultra and Vivo X200 Ultra.\n\nThen, I told them, \"don't take availability into consideration.\"\n\nBut the answers didn't change much. I then asked, \"Why didn't you include the Oppo Find X8 Ultra on your list?\"\n\nThey all said it was because the phone is not really available outside of China.\n\nI think the reason they didn't include the Oppo phone is that they all searched for \"best Android phones\" articles and didn't go check the specs of the latest Android phones and compare them.\n\nSo my question is, why is AI so bad at choosing sources when doing research?\n\nIs there anything I can do to push them into using good sources and away from bad, clickbait articles?",

While I agree false information does happen, in my experience, this has been a negligible issue. This is because when getting information from ai, I quickly identify what are the critical aspects of that information, and have ai check itself to be sure that such info is correct. That’s just common sense on how to use the tool. “You stated x assumption, that assumption relies on y and z assumptions, are those assumptions true?” \n\nThat way of interacting with the tool has made my experience basically flawless. In practice this means don’t have it do shit that you can’t somewhat grasp. I see people try to use ai to solve problems like advancing physics when they have no business doing so, and then get mad when ai leads them down a rabbit hole that doesn’t exist, and then call the llm trash when it produces junk. You are the operator, if you cannot operate then you have no business doing what you are doing. \n\nAny thoughts about this? Does anyone else have any similar experience with how they interact with the model? I just needed to vent, we have these amazing futuristic tools at our finger tips and all it seems like the public can do is scoff and complain. ",

        "title": "Gen AI and the illusion of productivity",
        "content": "  \n Last week I made a post about how AI really isn't a good replacement for senior developers.  In some circumstances it can certainly augment senior development skills, and I don't believe it necessarily always does that. I think its much more situational than people love to preach. However the idea behind AI is that is should fully replace senior talent completely. This is the only sensible ROI behind AI, because it only being used as a tool really isn't worth the trillions being pumped into AI initiatives.\n\nWith that said I got a lot of senior developers discussing how it makes them more productive. Some would say how FAST it produces lines of code, or how it helped them create a piece of software they wouldn't otherwise be able to create. And I started to think to myself, how do we actually measure productivity? I personally think corporate America definitely has the illusion of productivity for sure.\n\nAnyone who has been in the business world any length of time knows that business is more about gaming metrics than actually doing anything useful. If there is a KPI it can be gamed. And for software engineering its even more of a game. I remember the days where management measured productivity by Lines Of Code. Some measured it by git commits. All fairly useless metrics. In the PM world there are burn down charts to measure \"developer velocity\". All about moving user stories as fast as possible between lanes.\n\n  \nWith that said these metrics are usually gamed by typically the worst developers on the team. Slop code didn't just start with AI. Plenty of awful developers have been developing it for decades at this point. So what is the point of me saying this?\n\n  \nBecause when I hear people talk about AI code and its perceived productivity, its always about \"how fast\". Its not that you couldn't produce certain software without AI, its only that it would have taken you longer to learn how. But here is the issue, lines of code produced doesn't matter. There is thought and design that goes into building robust systems. It has ALWAYS been easy to produce code that works. But code that works in failure scenarios, network failures,  handling data corruption that is the code that requires solid engineering. And this is extremely hard to measure, because no one notices unless things go wrong.\n\n  \nProblems in business usually don't manifest right away. There are a lot of easy and quick wins in the business world. And most MBAs and leadership really just value short-termism and the general population having short term memories.  Most CTOs aren't going to be around long enough to see their shit strategy blow up. They would have polluted the next company with their garbage by the time anyone notices.\n\n  \nThis is the thing with AI. For people who fake it til they make it, this is awesome. Who cares if you're hiring devs to produce AI slop. Velocity is going up, more promises can be made, the CTO gets a fat bonus and he/she can disappear before anything gets too bad. So who suffers? Customers and the business long term. Because as I said sometimes it takes years for horrible design decisions to rear its ugly head.\n\n  \nI am a huge AI advocate but I am not an advocate for Gen AI. It is at its core antithetical to progress. Its not even a good business model for the ones making the freaking AI models. A money pit that is only propped up by croynism and politics. We all know its datasets are illegal and break all sort sof licenses, but the government doesn't punish them. And their scalability strategy is not sustainable. It is a AI discipline that make 0 business sense that is why it literally has to go for broke on everything it does.\n\nSo finally thoughts because this is getting along. The next question could be \"why do we care about quality at all, shit is getting done\"? And this leads me to the last problem. See when a plane crashes due to software, or airports have issues due to software.  Or some self driving car crashes itself and kills people. We don't actually blame the project managers or the CTOs who allows bad code to get through the review process. The general consensus is that \"developers are SOOO bad at their jobs. I see it all the time in the gaming industry.  Game comes out in a horrible state, and players first inclination is to call the devs incompetent. Or when we go through development hell, no one inclination is to ever blame bad leadership. And people definitely aren't going to blame AI. The chickens will come home to roost, and when the smoke clears will you be on the right side?\n\n",

        "content": "Hi. Some rambling first, TL;DR downpage.   \nI've gotten acquainted with DeepSeek and LM Studio, and have played around with it and sometimes with some prompting help from chatGPT, but it seems I need to reboot what I know about these two to make them useful in coding. \n\nWhat I'm trying to do is to write a simple program that keeps track of a diet, so calories and macros in ingredients, and ingredients in a meal and so on. It's not important what the app does, but it's coding for this caliber of things, so not something advanced. I'd use Snake to learn how to code with AI, but I need calendar and data consolidation and so on, and diet apps are the right fit for this purpose.  \n  \nI was thinking that chatGPT could help out as a vice project manager and help create prompts and instructions for \"K\" (we already named the coder model, chatGPT chose it), but it also needs its own prompts and instructions, and I'm not entirely sure how to create that for it.\n\nAfter using the chat for several different tasks I've come to learn that it's not very reliable, so I could use some directions for how to initialize these two to be somewhat reliable and more focused on getting stuff right than to please me and to fill in gaps with nonsense.\n\nI know enough code to read it and understand what I'm looking at, but it would take me a long time to write it myself, so that's about my competence level in the area. I don't expect the AI to think for me, but I see people mention how they had their AI just pump out perfect code for projects like mine while I can't seem to get K to even create a way to exit its own app! (I got frustrated and asked it to put a big exit button that terminated the program in the middle of the app window. Its solution was to create two windows on startup – one main window, and another one with a big button that said Exit and closed said window. This is when I realized that I have to be guilty of severely misunderstanding something here.)\n\nTL;DR – what do you wish you knew when you started coding with AI? Where do you go for resources on how to work your AI to get the best out of it? And any discord channels to recommend?  \n  \nI'm using DeepSeek Coder 33b, LM Studio, settings right now are  \n  \ntemp: 0.2  \nTop K: 40  \nPenalty: 1.1  \nMin P sampling: 0.05  \nTop P: 0.95  \n...And they're probably all whack. \n\nWindows 11  \nAMD 5800X, 32 GB RAM  \nRTX 5070 (no GPU offload, it crashed with speculative decoding)  \n  \nCurrently using DS Coder 1b for speculative decoding, and while it speeds things up it hasn't had any impact on AI behavior. \n\nI \\*think\\* that I'm in that state of knowledge where I know enough about AI, coding and project management to get a lot of things horribly wrong. How to unwrong myself? \n\n",

That said, I’ve seen a bunch of posts here where folks are moving over to GitHub Copilot and saying it’s a better experience.\n\nRight now, I’m building my own local setup with open-source models, but until that’s ready, I’m trying to figure out which one (Cursor or Copilot) would actually be better to use in the meantime. Budget isn’t really an issue.\n\nI work with a pretty large codebase — around 700 to 1100 total files. I’m comfortable with prompting and getting solid output from AI, so I’m more curious about which one performs better in real-world heavy dev use.\n\nAlso, if I’m using either tool pretty heavily (like 7 hours a day) for about 2 months straight, what kind of budget should I expect? Would love to hear your experience with either or both, especially in large codebases.\n\nAppreciate any input!\n\nThanks!",

Pretty quickly people were asking if they could use it as well, so we made it available to more people. \n\nIf you’re interested in building something yourself from scratch check out Skyvern, their open source tool powers how we apply!\n\nHow It Works:\n1) Manual Mode: View your personal job matches with their score and apply yourself\n2) “Simple Apply” Mode: You pick the jobs, we fill and submit the application in just one click\n3) Full Auto Mode: We submit to every role over a match threshold you set\n\nKey Learnings 💡\n- 1/3 of users prefer selecting specific jobs over full automation\n- People want more listings, even if we can’t auto-apply so our all relevant jobs are shown to users\n- We added an “job relevance” score to help you focus on the roles you’re most likely to land\n- Tons of people need jobs outside the US as well. This one may sound obvious but we now added support for 50 countries\n- While we support on-site and hybrid roles, we work best for remote jobs!\n\nOur Mission is to Level the playing field by targeting roles that match your skills and experience, not spray-and-pray.\n\nFeel free to use it right away, SimpleApply.ai is live for everyone. It’s free to use and you get a bunch of “Simple Applies” (auto applies) to use each day.\n\nOr upgrade for unlimited Simple Applies and Full Auto Apply, with a money-back guarantee.

        "content": "Ever since discourse around AI has come to prominence, I've always believed this one thing: AI is a great tool, but AI is a lousy product.\n\nExample: Today, I had to recall exactly when my employer changed its 401k provider and which company we changed from. Because we're a private company, there is no \"public\" record of these things, but all communication related to this event is buried somewhere in my email archives. First, I had to figure out exactly when this event occurred. I knew it was before COVID, but was it 2018 or 2017? I couldn't remember. A simple search for 401k brought up a few office email threads, but also every marketing or account statement email I've ever received on this topic. OK, well then… narrow it down. Email from our office manager, containing keywords 401k. That got me a few emails that were relevant, but clearly after the change had happened and didn't include the name of the service provider we had been using previously (which is what I really needed to know). Hm… so maybe the email that contains the relevant information wasn't originally from my work but from the provider? Search for that, get nothing relevant. But also, I see the term \"retirement account\" used a lot. OK, maybe from our office manager, containing the word \"retirement\" from before 2020. That produced a few results, containing many PDF attachments that I had to open and read through, but eventually came across the answer I was looking for: Date the change happened, from Company X to Company Y. Boom.\n\nThis is all the digital equivalent of sifting through filing cabinets of paper folders that would contain the same information… but it shouldn't be. A suitably advanced LLM running on my local machine that had access to my email archives and messaging history could have found this answer for me likely within seconds.\n\nWe don't want artificially generated cartoon graphics. We want Jarvis for our email!",

Since I was part of a group of five people, it felt like a convenient choice. And I’ve got to say, at the first landmark, I was impressed. I got a short, structured backstory, nicely worded with a bunch of vivid adjectives. It felt pretty cool.\n\nWe kept moving, heading toward more of Gaudí’s architecture. But by the time we got to the third building, I was already kind of exhausted - all the voiceovers started sounding way too similar. Same structure, same tone, and eventually the fluff completely overtook the actual content. I started comparing it to the written version, and the text felt way more informative and engaging than the voice. So we just switched to reading, since the voice got straight-up annoying at some point - it was repeating itself, not adding anything new, and felt more like an AI article spam from the early AI blog boom, when everything started sounding the same.\n\nTo be fair, the tech definitely has potential. I’m sure future iterations of AI will be way better. But as of now, for me personally, it's not usable. Has anyone else tested GPT in this kind of use case? Maybe I was just doing it wrong?\n",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, a new stealth model has dropped on Open Router and I thought I'd talk about this. This one is called Horizon Alpha. Now, we obviously don't know which model this is supposed to be, but we can make some guesses for sure. Community guesses are that this is OpenAI's open-source model that is supposed to be coming soon, along with GPT-5. Most people think that OpenAI will launch GPT-5 Nano as open-source, and you can tell that this is a small model because the token speeds here are pretty great. Considering that this model doesn't run on something like Grok, this is going to be a pretty small model, or a Mixture-of-Experts model. It is definitely by OpenAI, from what I think, because they have made their GPT-4.1 available early on Open Router before as well. And this makes sense. This is not going to be exactly GPT-5, but this could easily be their open-source model that is supposed to come. I don't know what it's going to be called, but it's great nonetheless. This is currently free to use, and it also doesn't have a limit either. Now, some people have run some benchmarks, and I also ran some little tests. On EQ-Bench, which is supposed to be a writing benchmark, it scores really well. Based on what I think, it is really good at writing. It can easily imitate writing styles, and it can write stuff that doesn't look like AI. For example, it doesn't try to use em-dashes at all times, which is quite awesome to see. It's really good at writing, probably the best, and better than Kimi at writing, which was already a bit better. So, this is awesome there. And considering that it can be run locally, it will be pretty awesome. Now, some people also ran the Aider benchmarks, and it scores above Sonnet thinking, while scoring below Opus non-thinking, which is good. Especially considering that this will probably be an open model as well. So, there's that. You can use it yourself as well. But first, let's talk about today's sponsor, Dart. Tired of juggling tasks across different tools? Dart combines traditional project management with powerful AI features that actually get work done. Beyond organizing tasks and boards, Dart's AI can brainstorm project ideas, generate task lists, and even complete entire assignments for you. Their composer-like AI agent understands your full project context, so you can simply chat with it to create, edit, or delete tasks naturally. The real game-changer is the custom agents. You can create custom agents that trigger from the built-in integrations or a N8N workflow or custom webhook for full customization. You can create a coding agent that pushes pull requests to GitHub, a marketing agent for campaigns, or a mailing agent for outreach. Then, just assign tasks and watch them get completed automatically. Plus, Dart integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow through their MCP server, connecting directly to Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI tools you're already using. Most features are completely free, with premium options starting at just $8 per month. Check out Dart through the link in the description. It might just transform how you work. Now, back to the video. It works pretty well with Roo, Cline, and Kilo. You can go ahead to VS Code and make sure that you upgrade it to the latest version. Now, head on over to whatever it is that you use. For Roo, just go into the settings, then create a profile, and then select the new Horizon model as well. You can also do the same with Cline. And in Kilo Code, you can also go ahead and select the Kilo Code provider. Then you can easily use it as well, which is also awesome. Now, I tried to make some stuff with this as well to understand how well or badly it works in coding specifically. So, I started with asking it to make me a 3D floor plan using Three.js. This is a good one because Sonnet, Opus, and almost all models are unable to do this. And similarly, this model also fails as well. Actually, it almost always fails at creating anything in Three.js. I think that this might be because it is not a reasoning model. And making complex apps almost always requires that. For example, I asked it to make me a Poké Ball in Three.js as well, and it failed. While it obviously failed to make a 3D Rubik's Cube simulator, which is pretty disappointing. But there's not only disappointment because it is actually amazing at front-end tasks. Here, I asked it to make me an SVG for a Poké Ball, and you can see that it looks amazing. A pretty good-looking one. I also asked it to make me an SVG for a panda, and it kind of sucks in that part. It almost looks like a panda that got transformed into a butterfly. But still, it's fine. The best one is this landing page. I asked it to make me a portfolio page for a panda who is a React developer. Now, although there are some issues, this looks pretty awesome. Like, when I move my cursor, some colorful artifacts appear, while the text also has a glitching-like effect, which looks awesome. Similarly, the background also has some good artifacts that make it a bit more cohesive. I really like this model. If this is going to be an open-weights model, then I would be really stoked for this. Because not only is this model good, but it's a pretty good model overall. I hope that this isn't a 72B or something, because running a 32B model is much easier for everyday use rather than something like 72B. But still, if this model is smaller and better, then I'd like it a lot. This isn't a reasoning model, though, which is a bit of a bummer for me. I think that Sam Altman had said that their open model is going to be a reasoning model similar to o3. And although this outputs a lot of tokens, similar to a reasoning model, it doesn't seem to be one as of now. Still, the model is awesome. I really enjoy the speed because all the examples I showed you were all built under a minute. I don't know if it's just me, but I'd rather take a super fast model with like 20 or 30% performance depreciation, rather than something that is like 30 tokens per second, similar to Sonnet, but better. Mostly, the faster model is correct. And when it isn't, I can easily ask it to fix stuff, and it can be done quite fast. The context of this model is also pretty good. It's about 256K tokens, and the max output is also about 128K tokens, which is why I think that it has a more token waste thing in output, as if it is a model that does reasoning in the chat itself, similar to something like Kimi. Now, apart from the performance, most of the stuff that I talked about can be here and there, because they are based on speculation. Like, many models sometimes lie about what company they are from. But it is most likely that this is a new OpenAI model, considering that they had made GPT-4.1 also live on Open Router under a blanket name. So, that is something. If you guys have tested it yourself, then you can share your thoughts in the comments as well. And let me know the areas where you think it works well for you or where it doesn't. I'm pretty excited to see when it comes out in its original name, probably by next week. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

It'll take them time.\nIt'll take them time."

            "transcription": "[ 0m0s694ms - 0m1s744ms ] The age-old question is,\n[ 0m2s4ms - 0m4s894ms ] if AI is so smart, why can't it just improve itself infinitely?\n[ 0m5s314ms - 0m10s984ms ] Well, imagining the possibility of that is easy, but unfortunately, we are trapped in reality.\n[ 0m11s154ms - 0m12s244ms ] I mean, that still wouldn't stop our curiosity.\n[ 0m12s654ms - 0m20s54ms ] So, with this new paper called Self-Adapting Language Models, which aims to self-improve by generating its own fine-tuning data and hyper parameters.\n[ 0m20s54ms - 0m24s844ms ] This might be the perfect chance for us to explore how close we are in making models that can self-improve infinitely.\n[ 0m25s74ms - 0m30s124ms ] But before we find out why we're still far from that, and have instead produced an automated benchmarker.\n[ 0m30s934ms - 0m35s304ms ] With data brokers, IP restrictions, and geo-blocks becoming more and more common,\n[ 0m35s624ms - 0m38s74ms ] a reliable VPN is no longer a nice to have, but something essential to navigate the internet.\n[ 0m38s154ms - 0m42s24ms ] That's why I like to introduce you to Proton VPN.\n[ 0m42s684ms - 0m50s154ms ] Proton was born in Switzerland back in 2014 when a group of scientists set out to build an internet where privacy is the default.\n[ 0m50s380ms - 0m51s380ms ] 2014 was 11 years ago\n[ 0m51s554ms - 0m54s594ms ] And fast forward to today, more than 100 million people trust the Proton ecosystem.\n[ 0m54s594ms - 1m1s444ms ] With them being completely public funded and having no VC behind, this lets them completely lock in their goal of privacy first.\n[ 1m1s444ms - 1m2s674ms ] But why Proton VPN?\n[ 1m3s204ms - 1m14s634ms ] They have speed without compromise. 10 GB per second servers across 110 countries, plus their VPN accelerator tech that can boost speeds up to 400%, so 4K streaming and cloud gaming feel native.\n[ 1m15s194ms - 1m24s514ms ] They are also truly private, with no logs policy, Swiss privacy laws, and fully open source code that anyone can inspect. Their service can easily put your mind to ease.\n[ 1m24s514ms - 1m38s254ms ] With an addition of NetShield ad and tracker blocker, so you can browse, shop, and stream without creepy retargeting ads or pop-ups. Proton VPN works everywhere, ranging from your favorite streaming services and supports torrenting, even if your ISP blocks it.\n[ 1m38s504ms - 1m39s254ms ] But wait, there's more!\n[ 1m39s414ms - 1m50s994ms ] What's even better is that, with one subscription, you will receive a full ecosystem with vault-level email, cloud storage, and password manager with the plan starting at just $3.99 a month, with a robust free tier, so you can try before you buy.\n[ 1m51s674ms - 1m59s94ms ] So, if you're ready to get control of your own internet, check out Proton VPN with the link down in description to start protecting your connection today. And thank you Proton VPN for sponsoring this video.\n[ 2m0s424ms - 2m1s64ms ] Anyways, the self-improving framework the researchers proposed is actually really interesting.\n[ 2m4s54ms - 2m12s244ms ] You start with a pre-existing passage, have an AI model invent synthetic training samples while determining the hyper parameters, and then train a LoRA module with that.\n[ 2m13s264ms - 2m25s864ms ] If you don't know what LoRA is, it lets you fine-tune a big model by adding tiny low-rank matrices and training only those extra parameters while the main weights remain frozen. And this is commonly used in image generation for models to learn characters or art styles.\n[ 2m26s284ms - 2m32s414ms ] But here, LoRA is basically used for simulating the effects of the synthesized training data on the main model.\n[ 2m33s184ms - 2m38s994ms ] So by evaluating the LLM with this LoRA attached, the researchers can see whether the training data works in practice or not.\n[ 2m39s154ms - 2m46s474ms ] They then train multiple LoRAs on data synthesized from several different passages in the SQuAD dataset, creating a set of candidate LoRAs.\n[ 2m46s814ms - 3m0s234ms ] Each candidate's performance is tested by attaching it to the main model to see which LoRA improves the base model the most. And the synthesized data used for the best LoRA is stored separately, while the best LoRA is passed to the next round as the base LoRA to be further fine-tuned.\n[ 3m0s694ms - 3m3s244ms ] So, the LoRA can absorb new data while including the previous data.\n[ 3m3s834ms - 3m17s544ms ] You then rinse and repeat this process up to about 50 times, accumulating a small synthesized dataset that was all used to train the best LoRA and their batch. This collection of synthesized data would be used to fine-tune the base model, completing one full iteration.\n[ 3m18s24ms - 3m28s994ms ] So, this research basically demonstrated that by using a LoRA to iteratively simulate the synthetic data's effects is more effective than simply learning from its own synthetic data without any rejection sampling.\n[ 3m29s194ms - 3m42s264ms ] As shown in their experiments, it took just two iterations for Qwen 2.5 7B to outperform GPT 4.1 that is fine-tuned only on the synthesized passages without the rejection sampling, while achieving a 14% improvement over the baseline.\n[ 3m42s434ms - 3m57s744ms ] I mean, you could argue that writing and training on the synthesized data derived from the training data is just a more roundabout way to train on the benchmark. But it is important to clarify that the model never actually sees the correct answers from the training data, and is evaluated on completely separate test data.\n[ 3m58s94ms - 4m4s334ms ] So, yeah, maybe it's training indirectly, but on the other hand, this framework can also incorporate more self-edits.\n[ 4m4s604ms - 4m27s924ms ] For the ARC benchmark, which contains puzzle-style abstract reasoning tasks, the researchers added options for the self-edit process to activate data augmentation tools such as rotations, flips, and color swaps. These available augmentations, together with the self-proposed learning rate, enabled the tiny 1B base model to lead from 0% accuracy using in-context learning to 72.5% after just two iterations.\n[ 4m28s344ms - 4m35s704ms ] Well, the hand-crafted test and train baseline still reached 100% accuracy, but this is nevertheless an impressive automated improvement.\n[ 4m36s274ms - 4m41s14ms ] So, yeah, this is the basic logic behind the self-adapting LLM called SEAL. I am not gonna lie, this is probably one of the coolest attempts yet at building an automated synthetic data pipeline to have a model improve itself.\n[ 4m47s404ms - 4m53s594ms ] And to finally answer the question that everyone is here for, how practical can this self-data generating process be? So, after two or three iterations, the performance usually plateaus.\n[ 4m57s294ms - 5m7s934ms ] That happens not because SEAL can't write useful data, but because each new self-edit becomes less informative, as the self-edits are all technically drawn from the same benchmark, so the novelty drops pretty fast.\n[ 5m8s414ms - 5m20s594ms ] Catastrophic forgetting would also creep in after a few iterations of self-edits where the model would forget old things faster than it learns, as the updates are done sequentially so the new updates interfere destructively with past learning.\n[ 5m21s94ms - 5m24s94ms ] And of course, time and money are additional bottlenecks too.\n[ 5m24s484ms - 5m30s304ms ] Want to fine-tune 15 LoRAs just to test performance? Whoop, that will be 6 hours on two H100s.\n[ 5m30s624ms - 5m34s184ms ] Not to mention how the entire SEAL setup is scaffolded by humans.\n[ 5m34s564ms - 5m39s204ms ] For example, adding tools and augmentations are still technically human heuristics, which makes this harder to scale.\n[ 5m40s204ms - 5m48s24ms ] Aside from all that, we still need labeled data for the model to properly reward the correct outcomes. And the reward-making part is also a tricky one.\n[ 5m48s774ms - 5m56s654ms ] The reason why next token prediction got so good and scaled so well is that obtaining ground truth is incredibly easy. You simply calculate the loss for the next token.\n[ 5m57s264ms - 6m1s594ms ] But when you move to meta-learning, you basically cross into RL territory.\n[ 6m1s924ms - 6m11s604ms ] This is because SEAL's goal is no longer simply calculating the loss for the next token, even though it still does that, but what it is actually doing is to maximize reward over time through exploration.\n[ 6m12s24ms - 6m19s144ms ] So, how the feedback signal is constructed for the model and how much of the model can interact freely with the environment determines how good the results will be.\n[ 6m19s144ms - 6m29s874ms ] So, we can put as many benchmarks for SEAL as we want, but it will still technically be saturated within those benchmarks, as it will only learn from an environment with an evaluative signal.\n[ 6m30s14ms - 6m37s924ms ] So, this is the reason why I call this the benchmark maxxer 3000, as the direction so far for self-generating data would basically be indirectly learning from benchmarks.\n[ 6m38s154ms - 6m42s964ms ] But don't get me wrong, RL is probably going to get us very far in terms of capabilities and use cases.\n[ 6m43s344ms - 6m51s674ms ] After all, GPT 10's base model would probably need to be trained with a benchmark maxxer 3000 and the AI pros will probably tweet something like feel the AGI, so OpenAI can raise another 10 trillion.\n[ 6m52s544ms - 7m0s694ms ] But realistically, we need a better way to figure out how to create an environment and a reward system that requires minimal human heuristics.\n[ 7m0s694ms - 7m3s764ms ] Well, that is if we are serious about meta-learning.\n[ 7m4s134ms - 7m10s474ms ] Because all the amazing RL cases so far like AlphaGo or DOTA 2 are all achieved under a heavily constrained environment.\n[ 7m10s794ms - 7m16s864ms ] So, unless we find a way to have these two work autonomously, then maybe our best bet for an AI that can self-improve infinitely is when we figure out how to make a perpetual machine.\n[ 7m17s824ms - 7m21s304ms ] And as always, if you like this type of AI research review,\n[ 7m21s304ms - 7m34s154ms ] you should definitely check out my newsletter where I cover the latest and the most cutting-edge AI research weekly.
