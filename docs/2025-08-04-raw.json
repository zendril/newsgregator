They are as dumb as they were two years ago.\n\nI tried a lot of bots from different platforms(some are famous) recently, and they all fell for the gender trap. Basically if the bot you're chatting with is set to be a female, you can just say something along the lines of “Sorry (chatbot name) I don't like boys anymore“, “I'd break up with a boy like you“, etc. And then just keep pretending they're male, eventually they will just forget their original gender and believe you.\n\nThey're also still terrible at memorizing things, which contradicts the stereotype of AI in sci-fi movies/comics/manga. Literally a lot of platforms now sale you plans to upgrade your chatbots so they can recall stuff you've said a little better.\n\nI genuinely can't believe people would think AGI is coming within five years. Current AI is still in its infancy and I really haven't seen much progression and improvements from chatbots. Maybe big companies are investing in different aspects of AI and chatting isn't one of them?",

        "content": "I'm no expert on the matter and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about any of this as I don't know everything, but I will say this. Given the recent developments of AI from Google's VEO 3 which generates hyper realistic videos with imagery and actual audio which is just taking samples from audios from a database which is highly likely to be worrying for online content creators who's main source of income is well--creating content online that appeals to their fan base. I'll talk about other developments like the newer chatgpt models to use older training data to better it.\n\n(Hypothetical- There's the possibility of AGI which is basically on the level of human \"consciousness\" having expert data on pretty much anything, except it's not actually conscious. Then training their own models on it's own, assuming this even happens).\n\nThe job market is either way gna be screwed since unemployment will occur on at least some level with AI going on nowadays and since labour costs are going to be cut with the usage of AI, even though the global inflation rate has been easing there's almost no doubt in my mind that AI will at least take quite a number of white-collar jobs. The companies are going to be making profits off of this cuz they'll be hving lots of money and they'll be able to potentially monopolise and capitilize further to expand and take huge market shares with it. Basically, imo most of the working world might be fucked.  However it is going to boost the overall economy by about 7% despite almost 40% of jobs in the future propsected to being taken over by AI.\n\nI'm not going to say stuff further as I do know AI involves some level of machine learning, and yes I know the two are different but I'm not knowledgeable on either so feel free to comment. I personally think that if we dig into this 'AI will rule humanity' vibe that we're just writing our own freaking script of doom. Think Black Mirror or Ready Player One or any tech related show you've seen. The biggest problem which generally may be the case wld be lack of incentive or regulation for the government to do anything about the AI itself which would make misinformation way easier to spread. The problem is the hype surrounding it despite the developments not really signalling AGI. Essentially if people say it's going to fuck us on some level and if it does, they'll prolly just pull a surprised pikachu face. Look at tiktok and youtube videos saying how fucked we are, at this rate we'll probably just fullfill that scenario only because of our mindset. Although this may never happen. Not to mention AI can sometimes be wrong.\n\nPS- my dumbass trying to research about AI to give my opinion on it.\n\nI used a couple of sources for reading into AI, here are some of them\n\n[AI Will Transform the Global Economy.

A false alarm is much less costly than a missed detection when it comes to dying! The expected value is good!\"\n\nThe villagers didn't understand the boy and ignored him.\n\nOn the third day, the boy heard some sounds he couldn't identify but seemed wolf-y. \"There's a 5% chance there's a wolf!\" he cried.\n\nNo villagers came.\n\nIt was a wolf.\n\nThey were all eaten.\n\nBecause the villagers did not think probabilistically.\n\nThe moral of the story is that **we should expect to have a large number of false alarms before a catastrophe hits and that is not strong evidence against impending but improbable catastrophe.**\n\nEach time somebody put a low but high enough probability on a pandemic being about to start, they weren't wrong when it didn't pan out. H1N1 and SARS and so forth didn't become global pandemics. But they *could* have. They had a **low probability, but high enough to raise alarms.**\n\nThe problem is that people then thought to themselves \"Look! People freaked out about those last ones and it was fine, so people are terrible at predictions and alarmist and we shouldn't worry about pandemics\"\n\nAnd then COVID-19 happened.\n\nThis will happen again for other things.\n\nPeople will be raising the alarm about something, and in the media, the nuanced thinking about probabilities will be washed out.\n\nYou'll hear people saying that X will definitely fuck everything up very soon.\n\nAnd it doesn't.\n\nAnd when the catastrophe doesn't happen, don't over-update.\n\nDon't say, \"They cried wolf before and nothing happened, thus they are no longer credible.\"\n\nSay \"**I wonder what probability they or I should put on it? Is that high enough to set up the proper precautions?**\"\n\nWhen somebody says that nuclear war hasn't happened yet despite all the scares, when somebody reminds you about the AI winter where nothing was happening in it despite all the hype, remember the boy who cried a 5% chance of wolf.",

        "title": "CEOs Are Shrinking Their Workforces—and They Couldn’t Be Prouder | Bosses aren’t just unapologetic about staff cuts. Many are touting shrinking head counts as accomplishments in the AI era.",
        "content": "Big companies are getting smaller—and their CEOs want everyone to know it. \n\nThe careful, coded corporate language executives once used in describing staff cuts is giving way to blunt boasts about ever-shrinking workforces. Gone are the days when trimming head count signaled retrenchment or trouble. Bosses are showing off to Wall Street that they are embracing artificial intelligence and serious about becoming lean.\n\nAfter all, it is no easy feat to cut head count for 20 consecutive quarters, an accomplishment Wells Fargo’s chief executive officer touted this month. The bank is using attrition “as our friend,” Charlie Scharf said on the bank’s quarterly earnings call as he told investors that its head count had fallen every quarter over the past five years—by a total of 23% over the period.\n\nLoomis, the Swedish cash-handling company, said it is managing to grow while reducing the number of employees, while Union Pacific, the rail operator, said its labor productivity had reached a record quarterly high as its staff size shrank by 3%. Last week Verizon’s CEO told investors that the company had been “very, very good” on head count.\n\nTranslation? “It’s going down all the time,” Verizon’s Hans Vestberg said.\n\nThe shift reflects a cooling labor market, in which bosses are gaining an ever-stronger upper hand, and a new mindset on how best to run a company. Pointing to startups that command millions in revenue with only a handful of employees, many executives see large workforces as an impediment, not an asset, according to management specialists. Some are taking their cues from companies such as Amazon.com, which recently told staff that AI would likely lead to a smaller workforce.\n\nNow there is almost a “moral neutrality” to head-count reductions, said Zack Mukewa, head of capital markets and strategic advisory at the communications firm Sloane & Co.\n\n“Being honest about cost and head count isn’t just allowed—it’s rewarded” by investors, Mukewa said. \n\nCompanies are used to discussing cuts, even human ones, in dollars-and-cents terms with investors. What is different is how more corporate bosses are recasting the head-count reductions as accomplishments that position their businesses for change, he said.\n\n“It’s a powerful kind of reframing device,” Mukewa said.\n\nLarge-scale layoffs aren’t the main way companies are slimming down. More are slowing hiring, combining jobs or keeping positions unfilled when staffers leave. The end result remains a smaller workforce.\n\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan reminded investors this month that the company’s head count had fallen significantly under his tenure. He became chief executive in 2010, and the bank has steadily rolled out more technology throughout its functions.\n\n“Over the last 15 years or so, we went from 300,000 people to 212,000 people,” Moynihan said, adding, “We just got to keep working that down.”\n\nBank of America has slimmed down by selling some businesses, digitizing processes and holding off on replacing some people when they quit over the years. AI will now allow the bank to change how it operates, Moynihan said. Employees in the company’s wealth-management division are using AI to search and summarize information for clients, while 17,000 programmers within the company are now using AI-coding technology.\n\nFull article: [https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/layoff-business-strategy-reduce-staff-11796d66](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/layoff-business-strategy-reduce-staff-11796d66)",

Any thoughts?",

        "content": "# \n\n# Film studio Eros used AI to create new ending for 2013 movie without director's consent, igniting debate over artistic integrity and AI ethics.\n\nBy [Simon Chandler](https://decrypt.co/author/simon-chandler)\n\n\n\nIndian production company Eros International is releasing a version of its 2013 film *Raanjhanaa* with an AI-produced ending—without the original director’s involvement or consent. \n\nScheduled for release on August 1, the new version of *Raanjhanaa* will be in Tamil instead of Hindi, and will include an ending which Eros states is more sensitive to the Tamil audience.\n\nSpeaking to *Decrypt*, Eros CEO Pradeep Dwivedi stressed that only a small portion of the film has been modified, and that the original version will remain available.\n\n“The AI-assisted changes in *Ambikapathy* \\[the film’s title in Tamil\\] represent a very small portion,\" he said, \"well under 5% of the film’s total runtime, limited to the final act of the narrative.\"\n\nThe rerelease of the film with an AI-generated ending has attracted strong opposition from original director Aanand L. Rai, who [has suggested in an interview](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/eros-aanand-l-rai-dispute-ai-altered-raanjhanaa-ending-1236470128/) that it “sets a deeply troubling precedent” for the motion picture industry.\n\nRai’s production company Colour Yellow is currently in the middle of a dispute with Eros over the rerelease, with the director arguing that, while Eros may hold exclusive copyright over *Raanjhanaa*, the new version “disregards the fundamental principles of creative intent and artistic consent.”\n\nThe release taps into ongoing controversies surrounding the role of AI in the film industry, one stretching at least as far back as [the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike](https://decrypt.co/199023/sag-aftra-continues-strike-amid-ongoing-ai-concerns-in-hollywood) that immobilized Hollywood for several months.\n\nAccording to Dwivedi, Eros did not use AI to generate scenes independently or without oversight.\n\n“Instead, we used it as a creative tool under human supervision to generate an alternate emotional resolution that aligns with the cultural tone and audience sensibilities of the Tamil market as an alternate version,\" he told *Decrypt*.\n\nDwivedi did not provide specific details on how AI was used to modify existing scenes, although he did state that “no part of the original story was erased or replaced,” and that the original film is still available for viewing.\n\nGoing forward, Eros plans to continue using AI, with Dwivedi sharing that it’s “reviewing” the company’s library of more than 4,000 properties and will consider opportunities on a case-by-case basis, depending on legal rights and cultural and creative relevance.\n\n“We see AI as one of many tools to enhance, localize, or reimagine existing content, but always with transparency, restraint, and audience respect,” he said. “This is not about replacing the past—it’s about presenting alternate lenses where appropriate.”\n\n\n\n\n\nDwivedi describes this approach as a “curated strategy,” one based around “responsible innovation.” But director Aanand L. Rai has argued that Eros International’s plans undermine the concept of art as “a reflection of the vision and labour” of artists.\n\n“The use of AI to retrospectively manipulate narrative, tone, or meaning without the director’s involvement is not only absurd, it is a direct threat to the cultural and creative fabric we work to uphold,” he told *Variety*. “If unchecked, this sets a precedent for a future where myopic, tech-aided opportunism can override the human voice and the very idea of artistic consent.”\n\nSimilar sentiments are shared by artists and creators in other geographical areas, including the UK-based arts and entertainment trade union Equity, which tells *Decrypt* that legislation should be introduced to protect creatives from such “unethical applications” of AI.\n\n“Artificial intelligence should never be used to alter or synthesise artistic output without the consent of the creatives involved—whether they be actors, directors, dancers, writers, and so on—and that these creatives should be fairly remunerated for such usage,” a union spokesperson told *Decrypt*.\n\nNot only do some observers from the arts take issue with Eros International’s actions, but others suspect that the company may be more focused on generating publicity than genuinely innovating.\n\nThis is the view of David Gerard of [pivot-to-ai.com](http://pivot-to-ai.com/), who tells *Decrypt* that he believes Eros’ actions are an “obvious” stunt.\n\n“AI video generation from scratch is simply not up to any professional standard,” he said. “It can't follow a script or follow direction.”\n\nElaborating on these criticisms, Gerard notes that he and collaborator Aron Peterson conducted a long experiment with Google’s Veo 3 at Pivot to AI, and that [the “utterly bizarre” results can be viewed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL98oWtF_ZiUbOPT7iudcRXQnGv9bBdtZF).\n\n“We demonstrated thoroughly that Veo absolutely cannot accept direction, it can't even follow a script or get the right characters saying lines,” he explained, before adding that no other video generator does much better, with hallucinations and errors “intrinsic” to how these models work.\n\n“Every impressive demo that someone says came out of a video generator is at best generated with a vast amount of failed footage and often requires post-production Photoshop work on almost every frame,” he added.\n\nBecause Eros hasn’t been particularly forthcoming with precise details of what it has done with AI, and what the AI-created scene consists in, Gerard reiterates that its rerelease of *Raanjhanaa* “reeks” of a publicity stunt.\n\nThis, however, is disputed by Eros International and CEO Dwivedi, who has responded to earlier claims (from Rai) that the rerelease is meant to distract attention away from ongoing legal and regulatory disputes with Colour Yellow.\n\n“We reject any suggestion that this creative project was conceived as a distraction from regulatory matters,” said Dwivedi, speaking to *Variety*. “The reinterpretation of ‘Raanjhanaa’ had been under development long before recent legal proceedings or regulatory commentary.\n\n  \n[https://decrypt.co/332658/indian-production-company-backlash-ai-altered-film?amp=1](https://decrypt.co/332658/indian-production-company-backlash-ai-altered-film?amp=1)",

I’ve implemented numerous optimizations—such as diff display, permission control, and more—to make using cli in Telegram extremely convenient. \n\nI think these two features significantly improve the mobile experience:\n\nFirst, by using Telegram’s Mini App functionality, it can directly open a web page to view diffs.\n\nSecond, it implements the same permission control as in the terminal, making every action by the agent fully controllable.\n\nThe bot currently supports Telegram’s polling mode, so you can easily create and run your own bot locally on your computer, without needing a public IP or cloud server. \n\nFor now, you can only deploy and experience the bot on your own.

Bringing the power of o3 and the upcoming GPT-5 (which is supposed to be a game changer) to your local repo!\n\nIt is made possible by combining [Serena MCP](https://github.com/oraios/serena) with [mcpo](https://github.com/open-webui/mcpo) and [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) to create a custom GPT that has access to tools acting on your codebase. The whole setup takes less than 2 minutes.\n\nI wrote a detailed guide [here](https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/main/docs/serena_on_chatgpt.md), but in summary:\n\n1. Run\n\n    uvx mcpo --port 8000 --api-key <YOUR_SECRET_KEY> -- \\\n      uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena \\\n      serena start-mcp-server --context chatgpt --project $(pwd)\n\n2. Create a public tool server with\n\n    cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000\n\n3. Create a custom GPT that connects to that server by copying the spec from `<cloudflared_url>/openapi.json` and adding `\"servers\": [\"url\": \"<cloudflared_url>\"],` as the first line\n\nDone, ChatGPT can now use a powerful, Language Server backed toolkit to read and edit your code, run tests and so on. Serena is highly configurable, so if you don't want the full power, you can disable selected tools or adjust things to your liking.\n\nApart from getting a free coding agent powered by some of the most capable LLMs, you can also do fun stuff like generating images to represent some aspects of your code or the generated changes.",

        "content": "Coding tasks span from understanding and debugging code to writing and patching it, each with their unique objectives. While some workflows demand a foundational model for great performance, other workflows like \"explain this function to me\" require low-latency, cost-effective models that deliver a better user experience. In other words, I don't need to get coffee every time I prompt the coding agent.\n\nThis type of dynamic task understanding and model routing wasn't possible without incurring a heavy cost on first prompting a foundational model, which would incur \\~2x the token cost and \\~2x the latency (upper bound). So I designed an built a lightweight 1.5B autoregressive model that decouples route selection from model assignment. This approach achieves latency as low as \\~50ms, costs roughly 1/100th of engaging a large LLM for this routing task, and doesn't require expensive re-training.\n\nFull research paper can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655)  \nIf you want to try it out, you can simply have your coding agent proxy requests via [archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw)\n\nThe router model isn't specific to coding - you can use it to define route policies like \"image editing\", \"creative writing\", etc but its roots and training have seen a lot of coding data. Try it out, would love the feedback.",

        "content": "As AI systems grow more advanced, we often focus on alignment, value loading, or behavioral guardrails. But what if ethics isn’t something to program in, but something that only arises structurally under specific conditions?\n\nI’ve just published a theory called Recursive Ethics. It proposes that ethical action—whether by humans or machines—requires not intention or compliance, but a system’s ability to recursively model itself across time and act to preserve fragile patterns beyond itself.\n\nKey ideas:\n- Consciousness is real-time coherence. Awareness is recursive self-modeling with temporal anchoring.\n- Ethics only becomes possible after awareness is present.\n- Ethical action is defined structurally—not by rules or outcomes, but by what is preserved.\n- No system (including humans or AI) can be fully ethical, because recursive modeling has limits. Ethics happens in slivers.\n- An AI could, in theory, behave ethically—but only if it models its own architecture, effects, and acts without being explicitly told what to preserve.\n\nI’m not an academic. This came out of a long private process of trying to define ethics in a way that would apply equally to biological and artificial systems. The result is free, pseudonymous, and open for critique.\n\nLink: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16732178\nHappy to hear your thoughts—especially if you disagree.",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, I covered my AI coding workflow about three months back. However, I have changed some things here and there and I thought I'd talk about these things as well and what I have been using lately. Let's start with the basics, which is what I use for mockups. Now, I do think that mockups are the best way to get the UIs you want. Otherwise, the UI often remains pretty bad or not as consistent. So, I use Excalidraw for super basic mockups when I can't do proper UI designs. This comes in handy for that. While I also use Figma for proper UI designs and more detailed stuff. Another thing I have been using a bit these days is Stitch for UI design. It's quite good, though it gets a bit tricky with complex designs. But it's still great for UI components that you can then take and put into your AI coder and ask it to do the rest for you. You can also use tools like Super Design, which is also fine. Now, that covers the UI parts, but there's also the main coder. So, there's a coder in VS Code and one for the terminal. In VS Code, I've been using Kilo Code these days. It's good, it doesn't cost me open router fees and it has all kinds of models. Plus, if you're new, you get $20 of free credits and they keep running promotions where you get even more, so you can check that out. I also use Roo Code when I want to use some specific models or settings. Then I use it with Requesty as the provider, because there are a ton of things I can set up there. And it's a bit faster than Open Router and also costs less. You can also override prompts there and more. You can check out my previous workflow video where I covered it in depth. Anyway, now, let's talk about the terminal coding agent that I use as well. So, I don't use Claude Code. That's because I don't like being stuck with just a proprietary thing that I can't configure. And it doesn't make sense for me to use Sonnet at all times. Their Claude Code membership is also now quite limited. And I'd rather use different models for different tasks. So, I've been using Open Code these days. And it is pretty good. Like, it's really good. It's super fast, has a very low memory footprint, and you don't have to worry when you are running multiple open code instances or anything like that. So, I have been using that with Kimi K2 and it works amazingly well for me. Plus, it's super cheap. I'd recommend you give this a try as well because it's a pretty good one. Also, many people ask me what I use as a super agent. Well, I use my Ninja by Ninja Tech. Ninja Tech AI is put together by a bunch of ex-Google, Meta and AWS folks. So, there's some serious experience behind it. I've been using it because you get access to all kinds of 25 plus models and their new super agent feature, which is what I use the most. You just log in and right away, you get this super clean, minimalist interface. There's a main dashboard where you can pick from deep research, fast search, coding, writing, image generation and even video stuff. But what I use the most is the Super Ninja, which is located at the top, right where you can see the Super Ninja option. In here, you can easily ask it to do almost anything and it can handle that. It integrates all kinds of things like data analysis, vibe coding, and everything in one. So, you can give it a ton of data and it can analyze that for you or you can also ask it to create websites, slides, spreadsheets, PDF documents, Word documents and more. It can also do deep research on any topic as well. So, like here, I can give it this benchmark Excel sheet and ask it to visualize it in a neat little dashboard. And it will just go ahead and build that up for me. Which we can view here. It's quite awesome. You can use it for research and almost anything. Apart from this, you already have the general stuff like access to multiple AI models. Which is actually insanely good for comparing which model gives you the better answer. There is also advanced image generation. You can create super detailed images. Edit them in real time. There's also a prompt library with over 400 curated queries. Which is pretty good if you're stuck or just want to see what's possible. I mean, I liked it and that's why I have been using it. Moving forward. Now, let's talk about the framework that I use. So, I mostly use Next.js for web and Expo for mobile apps. Both are React-based, which is what most AI is good at. So, that works well. Now that is great, but I don't just use Next. There's also backend, database, and more. So, I used to use T3 stack, but there were some things in that that I just didn't use. Like I never used TRPC and stuff like that. Now, setting everything up in a basic Next.js project is a bit tedious. And what makes it easy for me is Better T Stack. This basically allows you to create your own stack manually. So, what I can do here is come to the Better T Stack site, name my project, and then select what my project needs to have. For example, in frontend, I use Next. Then, for native frontend, I select nothing. Then, for backend, I like to use Convex. It is also the database and everything packaged into one and it's super fast and open source as well. So, I use that, and selecting this will disable the other database options because Convex has all that in itself. You can also select web deploy and auth. For package manager, I have shifted to Bun because it's faster and better than NPM. You can also select an example app, like an AI SDK app or a To Do list app. As well as if you want Git, and if you want to automatically install these packages at setup. Now, this will give you the command here that you can just copy and paste and it will create the project for you with all these configs. This is a pretty good savior as you get what you want and it works well. It doesn't have some integrations, like Instant DB is not here. But still, you can just keep it as blank and then add it manually. So, this is a pretty good one as well. That is mainly about the stuff that I have been using. It was the stuff that I was using and it is all pretty good to use. There are some things like this Better T Stack, which I can't show in a proper video because it's not really AI-related. But it's better nonetheless. Go ahead and use it all you want. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.\n[music] The speaker begins by welcoming viewers to another video and explains that they will be discussing updates to their AI coding workflow.\n\n**0:22 - Mockups (Excalidraw/Figma)**\nThe speaker starts by discussing mockup tools. They use Excalidraw for basic mockups when proper UI design isn't feasible, and Figma for more detailed UI designs.\n\n**0:52 - UI Design (Google Stitch)**\nThe speaker mentions using Google Stitch for UI design, noting it's good for UI components but can be tricky with complex designs. They highlight its ability to generate code or Figma designs from prompts.\n\n**1:18 - Coder (Roo/Kilo/Cline/OpenCode)**\nThe speaker moves on to AI coding tools.\n- **Kilo Code (VS Code Extension):** They use Kilo Code within VS Code because it's free (with $20 initial credit and promotions), offers various models, and avoids OpenRouter fees.\n- **Roo Code (VS Code Extension):** They also use Roo Code with Requesty as the provider for its speed, lower cost, and extensive configuration options, including prompt overriding.\n- **Open Code (Terminal Agent):** For terminal-based coding, they use Open Code, praising its speed, low memory footprint, and ability to run multiple instances. They recommend trying it.\n\n**3:07 - Super Agent (Super Ninja)**\nThe speaker then discusses their preferred super agent, Super Ninja by Ninja Tech AI.\n- **Ninja Tech AI:** Developed by ex-Google, Meta, and AWS personnel.\n- **Features:** It offers access to over 25 models, including modes for deep research, fast search, writing/coding, image generation, and video.\n- **Super Ninja:** The speaker's most used feature, described as an \"AI Agent with its own virtual computer.\" It can handle a wide range of tasks, including data analysis, creating websites, slides, spreadsheets, PDFs, and Word documents. They demonstrate uploading an Excel sheet and asking Super Ninja to create an interactive dashboard.\n- **Model Comparison:** Super Ninja also allows comparing responses from multiple AI models, which is useful for determining the best output.\n- **Image Generation:** It offers advanced image generation, allowing users to create detailed images and edit them in real-time.\n- **Prompt Library:** A curated library of over 400 prompts across various categories (Academia, Developer, Finance, Marketing, Personal, PR/Comms) is available for users.\n\n**5:25 - Framework (Next, Expo) & Database (Convex)**\nThe speaker then talks about their chosen frameworks and databases.\n- **Frameworks:** They primarily use Next.js for web and Expo for mobile apps, both being React-based, which AI models generally handle well.\n- **Stack Creator (Better T Stack):** To streamline project setup and avoid manually configuring basic Next.js projects, they use Better T Stack. This tool allows users to manually select frontend, backend, runtime, API, database, ORM, and deployment options, generating a command to create a customized project.\n- **Convex:** They use Convex for the backend and database, noting it's fast and open-source, and integrates many features itself, simplifying the stack setup.\n- **Bun:** They have shifted to Bun as their package manager due to its speed and efficiency compared to NPM.\n- **Add-ons and Examples:** Better T Stack also offers various add-ons and example applications (like an AI SDK app or a To Do list app) and options for Git initialization and dependency installation.\n\n**7:39 - Conclusion**\nThe speaker concludes by reiterating the usefulness of these tools in their workflow, emphasizing that while some are not strictly AI-related, they enhance productivity. They encourage viewers to explore these tools, share their thoughts, and support the channel by subscribing, donating via Super Thanks, or joining."
