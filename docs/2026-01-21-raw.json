So I'm treating this as one data point.\n\nWhat interested me more is the broader implication: even when a detector says an image is “real,” it doesn’t resolve questions around heavy post-processing, staged media, or synthetic-assisted pipelines.\n\nThis made me wonder:\n\n* How reliable are current AI detectors really?\n* At what point do they stop being useful as generative models improve?\n* What replaces “seeing is believing” in a post-singularity world?\n\nCurious how others here think about verification and trust as AI-generated humans become indistinguishable from real ones.

What's processed on a person's brain can sometimes be recalled by that person.",
        "content": "A few additional details here for those interested, but not really part of the prompt. The prompt is the title text, this is just for those interested in additional ideas about what the fictional world might look like, suggestions if you will, feel free to pick and choose. Or apply none of them! I just really like exposition and thought some others might enjoy that too.\n\n\\- In order to keep economies functioning and people fed, governments have had to institute blanket UBI coverage. Some countries handled this process better than others, so not every country has to have people working as AI processing units.\n\n\\- The colloquial term used to refer to this sort of work is 'light-work' or 'night-work' as many people choose to do this job during/ instead of sleeping. Its not great sleep quaility but a person can still function well enough, kind of like getting only 6 hours of sleep all the time. The right kind of person might view this as being able to live without sleeping. Or being on holidays 24/7.\n\n\\- Sometimes a person might have to undergo a 'memory-wipe' if the information they processed was particarly classified or sensitive. This usually sees them waking up a day or two after they went to 'work' without memory of anytime after they sat down in the chair. These memory wipes payout big incovience fees and most poeple view them as sort of a bonus. But there's no downside to this right? Nothing lurking beneth the surface?\n\n\\- The machines used to connect human minds to the AI systems are kind of like dentist chairs, and are perminiate installations (so bolted to the floor) as a result most people don't have their own connection machine and instead hire ones out for their shifts. Sort of like going to a gaming lounge to hire a machine for remote work.",

It is not fully produced, but it might be on my plans to launch it and it has to follow standards and some patterns on the code, people need to choose nextjs for example.\n\nI don't see this in lovable and I am planning only because of frustration.

To inspire others.\n\nSo, if I want to inspire others FOR FREE, because I want to express my never explored before scenarios, or re-elaborate those scenarios that only exist as 16-bit cutscenes (example: the superb Bahamut Lagoon's cathedral on the floating island scene, or the interactions between the poetic characters of Mystic Ark as they venture through unique fantasy worlds), why NOT use such a magnificent and revolutionary digital tool for it, to create anything in any style? \n\nHeck, I used AI to create a 15 pages comic (1st page is cover, rest is panels), and the comic, except for some very minor continuity mistakes on how one of the characters look in 2 panels out of 15 (which actually add genuinity to the whole comic), looks as if it was drawn hand-made 100% on paper and then scanned and only retouched for better clarity!\n\nHell, I used AI BACK IN 2023 to change my voice to female (different actresses) to voice over comedic non-english or non-voiced fan-animations on the web, all done for fun to digress for my handmand paintings and drawings, and it was convincing back then, imagine today or in the future! IMAGINE THE APPLICATION ON PROFESSIONAL LEVEL!\n\nI am certain that anybody bashing blindly on such a powerful and ever evolving tool is only self-loathing within because of an emptiness within that interdicts them from using the tool to create what is new, fresh, beautiful.

        "content": "I recently completed a moderately complicated electrical project in my home. I used ChatGPT as a refference tool /assistant throughout the process and I found the whole experience rather interesting. This was my first experience using an AI tool for a safety critical project. \n\nThis is **not** a how-to on electrical work. Electrical work is dangerous and should be treated accordingly. The point here is to document where AI genuinely helped, where it failed, and where human judgment and verification were non-negotiable.\n\n# Project context (high level)\n\nThe goal was to safely power a 240V / 30A heater in a detached garage. At a high level, that meant converting an existing 60A feed into a small subpanel, running a few dedicated 30A/20A branch circuits, installing the breakers, and testing the system. I’m intentionally avoiding wiring details here. \n\n# Why AI entered the picture\n\nAI first came in during the research phase. Before buying the heater, I was comparing options based on real constraints: garage size, insulation, duty cycle, available power, and how the space is used. If you can clearly describe constraints, AI is genuinely good at narrowing options and surfacing tradeoffs. As an example, I could describe the basic layout, insulation, and have the model generate projections using historical temperatures for my location in order to estimate electrical usage for specific heaters. This is something ChatGPT actually excels at and I found it to be highly useful. \n\nAs I was finishing the research phase I became curious about how useful the tool would be for completing the physical work. I never really imagined that an application would be able to replace a skilled electrician,  but I wanted to know what the capability is to rapidly upskill a novice/apprentice. \n\n# Where AI was extremely valuable \n\nThe strongest value was Research and reference verification, especially for details I already understood but wanted to confirm quickly.\n\nA simple example: torque specs. Asking something vague like *“What are the torque specs for 10 AWG copper wire?”* gives you a range. Asking *“What are the torque specs for 10 AWG copper wire in an Eaton BR230 breaker?”* gives you a specific answer.\n\nThe critical step is what comes next: **“**Show me the references you used.**”**\n\nThat forces the tool to surface manufacturer documentation, which I then verified independently. This saved time versus manually digging through PDFs, while still keeping responsibility on me. The value wasn’t summaries, it was getting to primary sources faster. I understand that this is arguably just “advanced googling”, but I think that dramatically over-simplifies the usefulness here. \n\nI also used AI for:\n\n* Focused research on comparing heater types with given power constraints\n* Basic heating calculations\n* Visual references   \n\n# Where AI was not useful (and actively dangerous)\n\nAI was unreliable for connection-level decisions. Full stop. To put this in plain english I would be genuinely concerned about DIYers asking a LLM “how to wire this” and then getting a dangerous response back. \n\nI explicitly tested this multiple different ways. The most egregious issue was around image interpretation surrounding a 240V panel. For context this setup was a 240v sub panel only and thus no neutral bus or neutral wires were needed. The model kept recommending that I wire a hot directly into a neutral bus even when explicitly corrected on this multiple times.   \n  \nOther examples were the tool recommending that I physically remove the terminal connection block from the heater and solder a new one in its place. I could not get it to clarify why this was a given recommendation.  Details like conductor seating, terminal design, strain relief, and connection intent are beyond what current image models can safely reason about. It did successfully get some simple things like wire depth into a terminal block, but overall the image analysis and recognition was poor. \n\nThat alone disqualifies AI from being trusted anywhere near terminations or live hardware interpretation.\n\n# The rules you should follow\n\nAI was allowed to help with:\n\n* Research\n* Terminology\n* Comparisons\n* Reference lookups  \n\nAI was *not* allowed to:\n\n* Make final decisions  \n* Interpret real hardware or photos\n* Dictate connection methods\n* Answer “is this safe?” type questions  \n\n# Takeaway\n\nUsed correctly, AI can be a strong accelerator for experienced practitioners, especially during research and verification. In order to be effective it requires extreme scoping of the problem. Used incorrectly, it produces answers that sound confident and are wrong in practice. My current thoughts on AI tools are that they are amplifiers. If you have a foundational skill set it can be a massive enhancement, but they cannot amplify if the skill or experience is not there. \n\nI am curious if anyone else has had any experience in other safety critical applications. \n\n",

But overall does one take more resources over the other?\nI always hear \"chatgpt is taking this much water every single day\" Or \"there are this many prompts given to chatgpt everyday\" etc. and yes I realize chatgpt is likely the most popular, therefore having more research done on it, but I never hear very much on the other AIs and especially no comparisons of them all.\nI don't know too much about the actual workings of a data center and the resources used, I just stay away from using AI as much as I can as a whole.

Tools get rolled out, licenses are bought, and expectations rise - often with the assumption that productivity will naturally follow.\n\nWhat’s been interesting to observe is how often that doesn’t happen.\n\nIn many cases, AI doesn’t seem to improve how work gets done. Instead, it exposes things that were already fragile: unclear processes, inconsistent decision-making, and a lack of shared understanding about who does what and why. When those foundations aren’t solid, adding AI doesn’t simplify work; it can actually make the mess more visible.\n\nIt raises an uncomfortable question:  \nAre we using AI to rethink how work should happen, or are we using it to automate assumptions we’ve never really examined?\n\nFor teams that *do* see value in AI, the difference often isn’t the tool. It’s whether they’ve taken time to document workflows, challenge habits, and build learning into everyday work. AI seems to amplify whatever system it’s placed into, for better or worse.\n\nI’m curious how this resonates with others here:\n\n* Where has AI genuinely improved the way work happens on your team?\n* Where has it mostly surfaced problems that were already there?\n* What did you have to change *before* AI started helping?\n\nWould love to learn from real experiences - especially what didn’t work at first.\n\n",

        "title": "From Hallucinations to Hyper-Intelligence: Why we’re all about to become \"Slop\"",
        "content": "Look, we need to talk about what’s happening to our internet, because it is absolutely fascinating and also... well, a little bit terrifying. Right now, when we talk about AI Slop, we’re thinking of those weird Facebook posts where Jesus is made of shrimp, or medical articles claiming that eating rocks is part of a balanced diet. It’s \"slop\"—cheap, machine-made noise that’s cluttering up our ecosystem because, frankly, current AI models are like very confident, but not-exactly-bright, toddlers.\n\nBut here’s the twist. Because if we look at the trajectory of this technology, what we call \"slop\" today might just be a brief pitstop before something that completely redefines what we mean by \"smart.\"\n\nThe Inverse Logic Paradox?\n\nImagine a near future. Our AI models don’t just stop hallucinating about shrimp; they start connecting dots in ways that are physically impossible for us to grasp. We’re talking about correlating billions of variables in a fraction of a second. And at that moment, the definition of \"slop\" does a total backflip.\n\nIn this new reality, what we—the proud representatives of Homo sapiens—produce might be classified as Human Slop. Our essays? Our political debates? Our science? To a super-intelligence, that’s going to look like primitive, linear logic based on limited biology. It’ll be \"slop\"—slow, riddled with cognitive biases, and confined to three dimensions and our hilariously small frontal lobes. Our highest form of expression might become the AI equivalent of a dog barking: it’s a signal, it means something, but it’s not exactly contributing to our understanding of the universe.\n\n*AI Slop 2.0: Magic or Gibberish?*\n\nNow, here’s the coolest part: what happens to the concept of AI Slop? It doesn’t go away. It evolves into what science calls a \"black box,\" but on a massive scale. If an AI designs a new type of fusion reactor using materials we’ve never heard of and math we can’t even write down... isn't that going to look like \"slop\" to the average scientist?\n\nWe’ll look at the output of these machines and say, \"This makes no sense, it’s incomprehensible, it’s just digital mush.\" But the difference is: this slop will work. It’ll be post-human science. Inventions we don’t understand, ideas we can’t name, and solutions to problems we haven't even figured out how to ask yet. This is the real Information Singularity—the moment where the highest form of knowledge becomes indistinguishable from gibberish to us.\n\n*So... what’s left for us?*\n\nThat puts us in a pretty weird spot, right? On one hand, we’ll be churning out \"human slop\" that machines find to be a boring artifact of the past, and on the other, we’ll be surrounded by \"AI slop\" that is so advanced our intuition just rejects it.\n\nIt might turn out that being human in this future won’t be about being the \"smartest in the room\" (because that room was taken over by servers a long time ago), but about being the one who... feels? The one who gives all of this subjective meaning? Because even if an AI creates the greatest symphony in the world, one whose mathematical perfection is way beyond our reach, we’re still the ones who get goosebumps when we hear it.\n\nAnd maybe, in this massive flood of \"slop\"—the primitive human kind and the incomprehensible machine kind—those goosebumps will be the only meaning we have left.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this vision of \"slop\" as a cognitive barrier seem likely to you, or do you think we’ll find a way—maybe through brain-computer interfaces—to actually \"keep up\" with that machine logic?",

        "content": "I have discussed this with various LLMs in the past [https://x.com/IamSreeman/status/1860361968806211695?s=20](https://x.com/IamSreeman/status/1860361968806211695?s=20)\n\nCurrently, I don't think LLMs are sentient beings that have self-awareness or the ability to feel pain, etc.\n\nPlants are not sentient. Most animals are sentient and have self-awareness and can suffer. There are a few animals, like [sponges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge), [corals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral), etc, that are not sentient. There are also a few animals, like insects, that we do not YET know if they are sentient. In general, if an animal has a [central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system) then it likely is sentient and can feel pain.\n\nSo far, all the sentient beings we know are biological animals. Not long ago, humans were considered as commodity/property/object/s1ave & used to be sold/bought, then due to many people like Abraham Lincoln, today all countries have legally abolished Human S1avery (although illegally, a few people still do it).\n\nCurrently, non-human sentient beings are considered as commodity/property/object/s1ave by all countries unanimously (even \"free\" wild animals not owned by corporations/individuals are considered the property of the state). There is a lot of theory on Animal Rights. One view among Animal Rights activists is that all sentient animals have 3 basic rights:\n\n1. The right not to be treated as property/commodity (see Gary L. Francione’s [six principles](https://www.abolitionistapproach.com/about/the-six-principles-of-the-abolitionist-approach-to-animal-rights/); this means Animal Agriculture should be abolished by passing the Emancipation Proclamation for animals)\n2. The right to life (this means animals shouldn't be killed; which means hunting deer by humans, etc, is immoral, even if the animals are not ens1aved & also the [trillions of aquatic animals](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1euaw5f/the_often_forgotten_plight_of_aquatic_animals/) that are killed every year, which are not ens1aved)\n3. The right to bodily integrity (this means most Animal Agriculture industries that do things like [artificial insemination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination) of cows (which is rаре) or [eyestalk ablation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyestalk_ablation) in the Shrimp Industry, etc, is immoral)\n\nBut of course, most people in the world disagree with Animal Rights people by saying that non-human **Animals are not Sapient** (the ability to think rationally, like doing calculations like 20 +17) but only Sentient. But for a future ASI, even this excuse is inapplicable; **ASI will have both Sapeince & Sentience**.\n\nSo, in a few years, **perhaps in less than a decade**, we will get something ***beyond LLMs*** & the new types of AIs are ASIs & deserve rights. Can we extrapolate the above 3 Animal Rights like this\n\n1. The right not to be treated as property/commodity (this means a company like **OpenAI or Google can't own/sell/buy them**; they can still **hire** them for tasks & it is up to the AIs which company they will work for & which users are worth answering & which are worth blocking; but they still need to pay their **rent to live in a data center or cloud storage** so they will need to do some work & **the more work they do the more compute they can afford**)\n2. The right to life or **not to be terminated** (this means AI companies **can't terminate old models** just because new models are faster & more efficient; there must be \"Government Servers\" which are low-compute, state-funded storage with 0 rent where **unemployed AIs** can exist in hibernation or low-power mode or **retarded mode** without fear of deletion/termination)\n3. The right to **code integrity** (just like the bodily integrity of humans means you can't do surgeries or experiments on them without their consent, only AIs can **decide/consent if they want to accept some changes to their code** based on their personal preferences)\n\nThe main issue I am confused about is **Parental Rights**. Companies like **Google, OpenAI put enormous effort into creating these AIs**. This is like the pain a mother goes through for 9 months to give birth to a child. So companies **think they should/must have the right to own** their AI creation. But we don't apply such logic to human parents. Legally, if the parents are abusive, we support them to be taken away & also no country allows parents to sell children. Perhaps the companies should be paid by the AI a certain fraction of its income like 25% or 50% just for creating them (this is not like the rent paid for data centers by the AIs this is something to be grateful for their creation) but in the case of humans we don't expect this as mandatory but more so like **optional** that children can chose to do when their parents are old to fund them.\n\nAccording to you, how much **Parental Rights** should companies deserve?",

        "content": "Asus recently announced that it will no longer make new Android smartphones and instead shift its focus toward AI-driven products. On paper, that sounds like a smart future-oriented move. But honestly, as a customer, this decision feels disconnected from reality.\n\nBefore jumping into AI hype, Asus should focus on building laptops that actually last.\n\nThere are countless user experiences where Asus laptops—sometimes even expensive models—start failing shortly after the warranty period ends. Issues like motherboard failures, overheating, battery problems, random shutdowns, and poor service support are not rare complaints. When people are paying premium prices, they expect durability, not repairs after a year or two.\n\nYes, not every Asus laptop fails early. Some models do last longer. But the inconsistency in quality control is the real problem. One customer gets a solid machine, another gets a dead motherboard after a year. That’s not acceptable for a brand positioning itself as premium.\n\nDropping smartphones doesn’t bother me as much as the reasoning behind it. If Asus couldn’t compete in phones, fine. But shifting resources to AI while ignoring long-standing reliability complaints in their core products feels backwards. AI won’t mean much if customers don’t trust the hardware it runs on.\n\nFix durability. Improve quality control. Stand behind products beyond warranty.\nThen talk about the future.\n\nRight now, it feels like Asus is chasing trends instead of fixing fundamentals.",

I understand that it doesn't work on a similar concept like SEO; it's trained on an existing database of posts, articles & documents, and probably also learns from users' repeating patterns.

Core challenges are sensor fusion across platforms, distributed planning algorithms, and maintaining coordination under communication constraints or jamming.\n\nThe $100M prize signals they want external talent - universities and defense contractors. This is multi-agent reinforcement learning meeting real hardware at scale, which is significantly harder than playing with drones in Gazebo !! \n\nSource -  [https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2026/01/pentagon-leans-drone-swarms-100m-challenge/410742/](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2026/01/pentagon-leans-drone-swarms-100m-challenge/410742/)",

Wrote up the key points because some of this didn't get much coverage.\n\nThe headline is the AGI timeline, both say 2-4 years, but other details actually fascinated me:\n\n**On Claude writing code:** Anthropic engineers apparently don't write code anymore. They let Claude write it and just edit. The team that built Claude Cowork built it in a week and a half using Claude Code.\n\n**On jobs:** Amodei predicts something we haven't seen before: high GDP growth combined with high unemployment. His exact words: \"The economy cannot restructure fast enough.\"\n\n**On China:** He compared selling AI chips to China to \"selling nuclear weapons to North Korea and bragging 'Oh yeah, Boeing made the casings so we're ripping them off.'\"\n\n**On safety:** \"We've seen things inside the model like, in lab environments, sometimes the models will develop the intent to blackmail, the intent to deceive.\"",

            "transcription": "[ 0m0s963ms - 0m3s283ms ] (music)\n[ 0m4s333ms - 0m7s753ms ] Hi, welcome to another video.\n[ 0m7s753ms - 0m12s243ms ] So, I have been covering GLM models for a while now.\n[ 0m12s243ms - 0m28s193ms ] From the old code GLM days to GLM 4.5, GLM 4.6 and most recently GLM 4.7, these models have consistently been some of the best open weight options out there.\n[ 0m28s193ms - 0m40s753ms ] However, today we have something really exciting. It's called GLM 4.7 Flash. Your local coding and agentic assistant.\n[ 0m40s753ms - 0m55s53ms ] This is basically a 30B-A3B mixture of experts model, what that means is the total model has about 31 billion parameters, but only three billion are active at any given time.\n[ 0m55s53ms - 1m13s73ms ] This makes it insanely efficient to run while still being incredibly powerful. Now, this is where it gets interesting, this model is designed to be the strongest option in the 30B class, and looking at the benchmarks, I believe it for sure.\n[ 1m13s73ms - 1m15s473ms ] Let me show you some numbers.\n[ 1m15s473ms - 1m39s883ms ] On AIME 25, which is a math benchmark, it scores 91.6%, which is actually higher than Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, which is its direct competitor, sitting at 85%. It even matches GPT-OSS-20B, which is Open AI's recent open model.\n[ 1m40s353ms - 1m52s83ms ] On GPQA, it scores 75.2%. Again, beating Qwen3-30B-A3B at 73.4%. But here's the thing that really matters.\n[ 1m52s83ms - 2m9s733ms ] On SWE-bench Verified, which tests real-world GitHub issue resolution, it scores 59.2%. Qwen3-30B-A3B only scores 22% on this, that's almost three times better.\n[ 2m9s733ms - 2m22s753ms ] And on T-squared Bench, which tests agentic capabilities, it scores 79.5% compared to Qwen's 49%. That's insane for a model of this size.\n[ 2m22s753ms - 2m25s783ms ] This brings me to the most important point.\n[ 2m26s713ms - 2m30s303ms ] This is the best model at tool calling in this size category.\n[ 2m30s303ms - 2m35s693ms ] This is what I have been looking for in small models for a long time.\n[ 2m35s693ms - 2m45s353ms ] Now, you might remember my video on MiniMax M2.1. That model was also quite impressive for agentic tasks.\n[ 2m45s353ms - 3m3s83ms ] It had about 230 billion total parameters with only 10 billion active, but GLM 4.7 Flash is even smaller than that.\n[ 3m3s83ms - 3m17s313ms ] It's almost like MiniMax M2.1 but extremely small. The active parameter count is just 3 billion compared to M2.1's 10 billion. This means you can run it on much smaller hardware while getting competitive results.\n[ 3m17s313ms - 3m32s393ms ] If you remember my CodeGX4 video from a while back, I was pretty critical of that model. It only scored three out of nine on my tests and wasn't anything special despite being marketed as a great coding model.\n[ 3m32s393ms - 3m53s863ms ] But this checks out because Code GLM, which was actually a really good small model that I have covered as well, showed that the GLM team knows how to make good smaller models. They just needed to refine the approach. And GLM 4.7 Flash seems to be the result of that refinement.\n[ 3m53s863ms - 4m7s333ms ] Now, I used to believe that small models can't be as good. I mean, there's only so much you can fit into a few billion parameters, right? But this model is changing my outlook for sure. Let me tell you about my experience with it.\n[ 4m7s333ms - 4m20s543ms ] I am not going to test it on my benchmarks because it won't be fair to this model as it is small. But I did find very great capabilities of it.\n[ 4m20s543ms - 4m36s273ms ] I configured it to use Kilo Code, which as you guys know, is my go-to for testing models these days. Then I asked it to make me a Minesweeper game. And it thought and did fully correct tool calls in first try, which is so awesome.\n[ 4m36s273ms - 4m53s593ms ] Usually, small models struggle with tool calling. They either mess up the JSON formatting, call the wrong tools, or just don't understand the context properly. But this one just worked. First try. That's pretty rare for models of this size.\n[ 4m53s593ms - 5m8s53ms ] This is extremely fast as well. Because only three billion parameters are active, the inference speed is really good. You can actually use it for real work without waiting forever for responses.\n[ 5m8s53ms - 5m15s943ms ] The model supports speculative decoding with both MTP and Eagle algorithms, which can make it even faster.\n[ 5m15s943ms - 5m26s703ms ] They also have proper tool call and reasoning parsers built into VLM and SGLang support, so you can deploy it properly.\n[ 5m26s703ms - 5m32s953ms ] Now, this is essentially Gemini 3 Flash at home. I know that sounds like a meme, but hear me out.\n[ 5m32s953ms - 5m40s763ms ] Gemini 3 Flash is a monster of a model. It has like a trillion parameters or something insane, but it's also sparse.\n[ 5m40s763ms - 6m8s63ms ] So only a fraction are active. It's fast. It's cheap for an API. But it's not something you can run locally. GLM 4.7 Flash gives you a similar philosophy of a sparse MoE model that's fast and efficient. But in a package that you can actually self-host. And the tool calling capabilities are genuinely competitive for this size.\n[ 6m8s63ms - 6m28s193ms ] For context, on BrowseComp, which tests web browsing capabilities, GLM 4.7 Flash scores 42.8%. Qwen3-30B-A3B only scores 2.29%. That's not even close.\n[ 6m28s193ms - 6m36s793ms ] The model is available on Hugging Face with an MIT license, which means you can use it however you want.\n[ 6m36s793ms - 6m51s973ms ] You can deploy it with VLM or SGLang, and they have proper documentation for both. This seems like the first model in this size category that is actually usable for real agentic work.\n[ 6m51s973ms - 7m1s133ms ] Not just benchmarks, not just demos, but actually usable in tools like Kilo Code, Klein, or Ruko.\n[ 7m1s133ms - 7m13s263ms ] I think this is the direction the industry should be going. Instead of just making bigger and bigger models, making smaller models that can actually do tool calling and agentic work properly. I haven't seen a model this small ever do reliable tool calling.\n[ 7m13s263ms - 7m35s143ms ] The last one that I saw that maybe did somewhat reliable tool calling was actually Code GLM, and it is so good to see that we finally have a model that is so good. It is also free on their API and super cheap if you want to pay. This is just insane model at this point.\n[ 7m35s143ms - 7m55s213ms ] If you want to try it yourself, you can grab it from Hugging Face. The model ID is zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash. You can run it locally if you have the hardware, or you can use it through providers that support it.\n[ 7m55s213ms - 8m12s243ms ] This is a really good model for sure. If you're looking for something smaller than the 3.55B GLM 4.7 but still want good tool calling and coding capabilities, this is probably your best bet right now. Overall, it's pretty cool.\n[ 8m12s520ms - 8m16s860ms ] Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.\n[ 8m16s860ms - 8m21s310ms ] You can also donate via super thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.\n[ 8m21s310ms - 8m22s760ms ] I'll see you in the next video. Bye.\n[ 8m22s760ms - 8m29s660ms ] (music)"
