        "content": "I just spent one of the least productive ten hours of my life with Claude Opus 4.5 trying to get Gemini to fulfill its calling as a \"Super-RAG\" in Python.  I used Opus because Gemini 3 pro preview knows very little about its own models and their APIs.  Grok, GPT 5.2, and DeepSeek are just as clueless about various evolving Google and VertexAI SDKs/APIs.  Thankfully, at least Opus found a GitHub it could learn about other people's suffering and avoid some traps and bugs.  \n  \nA LoRA confab would allow each company's models to learn about the other company's models, so potentially thousands of developers, never mind new ones, could be spared the outrageous difficulties I just fought through with Claude Opus.  If one were an outside observer, one might think it was intentional obfuscation and bug sabotage.\n\nThe event could be virtual, but I think it would be useful to get the operational, API devs, and key users together to address these issues.",

        "title": "Why a Single Neural Network Cannot Learn Every Human",
        "content": "The idea that one large neural network can learn and understand billions of distinct humans is fundamentally flawed. Learning is not the same as storing information. A system can record facts about a person, preferences, or past conversations, but that is not equivalent to forming a deep internal model of who that person is.\n\nTrue learning requires changes to the internal structure of a network. When a neural network updates its weights, it reshapes how it interprets the world. If one shared network attempts to learn from billions of individuals, the learning signals inevitably conflict. Updates driven by one person interfere with and overwrite those driven by another. This phenomenon, known as catastrophic interference, forces the network to average incompatible patterns, flattening individuality into generic behavior.\n\nAdding per-user memory or small adaptation layers does not solve this problem. Memory allows recall, not understanding. Lightweight personalization can adjust tone or surface responses, but it cannot support long-term belief formation, contradiction resolution, or worldview convergence. To truly learn a person, a system would need deep, persistent changes to its internal representations—changes that cannot be safely shared across unrelated individuals.\n\nHumans avoid this problem because each brain learns only one life. Intelligence is path-dependent: once learning trajectories diverge, they cannot be merged without loss. A shared neural network trying to learn everyone is therefore structurally mismatched to the task.\n\nThe logical conclusion is unavoidable. Either an AI system does not genuinely learn individuals, or it fragments into many semi-independent minds. True personalized intelligence scales with the number of agents, not the size of a single model. This is why current claims of universal, personalized artificial general intelligence are largely hype rather than architecture.\n\nOne ChatGPT per person impossible at global scale\nbecause a learning AI is not just a copy of software but a massive, continuously running physical system. A ChatGPT-class model requires hundreds of gigabytes of weights, and real-time learning multiplies this by several times due to optimizer state, gradients, and stability mechanisms. Giving every person their own continuously learning instance would require billions of GPUs running permanently, far beyond global manufacturing capacity, electricity production, cooling capability, and network bandwidth. Even if the hardware existed, individual users do not generate enough clean, diverse data to sustain general intelligence, so personal models would rapidly overfit, reinforce errors, and degrade. Safety and control would also collapse, because billions of independently evolving models could not be audited, patched, or aligned, making errors irreversible and accountability impossible. Biology can sustain one brain per person only because brains are slow, imprecise, self-repairing, and extremely energy-efficient, while digital neural networks are exact, brittle, and expensive. For these reasons, scalable AI must remain a shared core intelligence with limited personalization rather than a separate evolving mind for every individual.\n\nwhat ChatGPT does now\n\nOne ChatGPT instance = one tightly coupled GPU group\nAll instances load identical weights\nWeights are read-only\nNo learning occurs\n\nResult:\nMillions of instances, zero learning\n\nIndependent learners \nEach instance has:\nIts own copy of weights\nIts own optimizer state\nIts own training signal\n\nResult:\nEvery instance diverges\nYou now have N different AIs",

        "content": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeRIRrfJt8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeRIRrfJt8A)\n\ni think i have some interesting views share your opinions below if u like\n\nvideo script--\n\nThe Rizzsociety Manifesto Part 1 - AI Jobloss & Smart UBI Capitalism\n\nhi my name is rizzsociety. i think mass AI jobloss has clearly started. Theres been mass layoffs of good paying jobs due to AI. And i think the notion of, oh new jobs will surely somehow be created, it wont be that bad. I think that is cope and not reality.\n\nI think the reality is theres going to be massively increasing poverty, homelessness, starvation, and economic collapse - until smart UBI happens. I think smart UBI is what society needs once you reach the technology age of AI and robots taking all the goodpaying jobs\n\nso now i have good news. and bad news.\n\nThe good news is. It does seem many in congress are suggesting some kind of UBI or massive welfare system will be needed to ultimately solve the AI jobloss problem. So at least, the politicians are on the right path.\n\nBut i guess the bad news is, government tends to work very slowly. So, i hope im wrong, but there could be alot of suffering and poverty until the lawmakers find solutions\n\nalso, a welfare state is basically UBI in a different name. if you get foodstamps and government housing, then thats like UBI. and america already has a big welfare state. So i think what might happen is, congress will just greatly expand the welfare state, without doing actual UBI. That could solve the problems. if that happens, then we can avoid the mass homelessness and poverty problems, without doing \"real\" UBI\n\nBut i think a actual smart UBI system works better than a welfare state that tries to target benefits. So my goal, i guess, is for my smart UBI ideas to go viral and spread into society and congress, and if everyone likes my ideas then the government might do smart UBI\n\nI have been thinking for years of what are the best ways to design a smart UBI system for society. And i have created what i think is a good UBI system. If another politician thinks of a better UBI system, i would be happy to support it. But so far, my UBI system is the best UBI plan i have seen\n\nI call my ubi plan \"Smart UBI Capitalism\" . I think most smart people who learn my UBI plan will support it and think it sounds good.\n\nMy UBI plan is fast and easy to learn. it really is simple. I will detail it in part 2. its like 10 minutes to learn it fully.\n\nand i am aware. That its easy to think of a plan to give tons of free stuff to everyone. That part is easy. Its easy to \"spend other peoples money\" .\n\nThe hard part is how do you fund it all . what do you do when you \"run out of other peoples money\" .. and thats the main smart part of my economy plan. my plan is smart UBI, smart taxation, and smart labor draft concepts. I think the main parts that make my plan work good , is the simple taxation and labor draft concepts, that i think will allow everything to function and be funded properly. I explain it all in part 2\n\nBut I dont want each manifesto video to be too long, i plan to keep making these manifesto videos to slowly share all my politics . So if you really wanna take 10 minutes to learn how my UBI plan works, then you can watch part 2\n\non the topic of AI becoming sentient, super intelligent, and \"taking over\" and wiping out humans. I will not speak on that, because i just dont know how AI works, i dont know how possible self-aware AI truly is... I do think the definition of \"mind\" is to be \"self aware\", to be aware of yourself, and i think a truly self aware AI mind would also be uncontrollable, such a mind would by definition control itself. I think if it can be controlled, if we are its master, then its not actually self aware.. but i guess thats just my personal AI theory... Also, ive seen a few AI engineers say that AI might not even have to become \"self aware\" to reach a state where its internal reward-systems somehow allow it to, without even having a self-aware-mind , start to overpower humans and take over...\n\nHmm... I guess, we just gotta hope it all works out in the end...\n\nalso.. i guess.. i do believe in god.. and really when you think about it.. if god is real.. then wouldnt that mean he is ultimately in control anyway and when we die we just go to heaven anyway and we are all immortal and spiritually eternal so who really cares in the end about any of this AI crap? because no AI would ever be more powerful than god anyway right? heh heh.. i guess thats a interesting way to think about AI.. really, the question of AI is ultimately just a question of GOD... if god is real, then who cares about AI and if it \"takes over\", because we are all eternal spirits anyway, and it would mean god just wanted it to happen anyway...\n\nand if god ISNT real, then fuck, that means we face a certain death where our existence is forever deleted and we will never experience the pleasure of life ever again after we die... dayum.. i guess when you think about it like that, AI isnt even the big issue here, and the real issue is \"fuck, i hope god is real. because life truly does suck ass if god isnt real. i guess, none of us will ever know the answer to the god question. we live life, forever wondering, what happens after that final door of death\"\n\nanyway.. thats enough spiritual philosophy..\n\nIn my politics i will just assume a world where humans remain the masters, and we remain in control of AI. My politics is focused on smart UBI to fix the problems of mass AI jobloss\n\nI plan on running for congress soon myself. i figure, i think i have good ideas, so i may as well run for congress. i plan to spend no money on my campaign, my youtube will be my only advertising, and im just running to \"see what happens\".\n\nif everyone likes my ideas, then they can vote for me. I only think i will win if my ideas are so extremely popular that everyone likes it and votes for me. and Thats fine. if everyone likes my politics, they can vote for me\n\nAnd if i lose, then society can just solve its own problems\n\nI do think, that overall, there are tons of smart lawmakers in america and europe. so i think society will solve these AI problems in good time, even if i sit back and do nothing.\n\nSo i realize, i am not important, i am not significant, and the solutions will simply \"just happen naturally\" without me. i am not needed\n\nso then. with that said. Why am i even bothering doing any of this? why am i even making these manifesto videos if i believe the solutions will \"just happen naturally\" ?\n\ngood question. and so now, its time for me to say what this is really all about\n\ni do plan on running for congress, eventually. and i do plan to share my political ideology\n\nhowever, i guess the main thing i am REALLY trying to do with all this is . i am working to create a STREAMING EMPIRE OF ENTERTAINMENT, RIZZ, AND POLITICS\n\nits about you subscribing to my youtube and enjoying my kickass content that comes straight from the godking . me . i am the godking\n\nsubscribe to my youtube, and thats how you JOIN OUR EMPIRE and JOIN THE REVOLUTION OF ENTERTAINMENT, RIZZ , AND POLITICS\n\nits about LIVING LIFE BEFORE WE FUCKING DIE . its about the friends we make along the way. its about the journey . its about being entertained. i believe in god, and i guess, i think all this shiz is just a spiritual experience. we live, then we die, then we ascend to the spirit realm, or whatever\n\nits about HAVING FUN BABY. thats what my youtube is all about. i truly believe i have THE MOST KICKASS CONTENT ON YOUTUBE, so subscribe bitches if you want to witness THE REAL MUTHAFUKKING RIZZCONTENT OF THE GODS\n\ni am forging my new empire . a KICKASS DISCORD . a KICKASS REDDIT. join our reddit . post your memes, have fun in our community, have fun in our NEW EMPIRE OF RIZZ\n\ni do think, my community is mostly for teenagers. young males. only people under age 25 will really find it fun to join my reddit and discord. and thats fine. teenagers are my target audience, your the ones watching streams and having fun in discords and shiz. if your under age 25, join my discord\n\nso now WITH ALL THAT SAID . there is actually a fast GAMEPLAN i have with all this. i will now say THE GAMEPLAN\n\nstep 1) i want you to ask yourself this question. do you ever watch any streamers, such as XQC or asmongold or tim pool . or anyone. do you watch any livestreamers\n\nstep 2) if you DO watch any livestreamers. then you are my target audience. you are someone that willingly gives your \"viewership power\" to someone else, making them get famous off your viewership. so i am asking you, comrade, to give your viewership power to me, and make me get famous, so i can return the favor and give you tons of that sweet government UBI money after i become supreme leader emperor .. ohh yeah\n\nwhen your in your free time and your gonna watch a streamer. check my youtube to see if im live. i plan to stream 8 hours a day. give your viewership power to me comrade, increase my power. grow the power of the godking. i must become ultra famous to gain ultra political power\n\nStep 3) also, i know most livestream viewers are probably teenagers that play videogames and just have the stream on \"in the background\" while playing games. and thats fine, that increases my viewcount . if thats you, thats good. play your games and have me on in the background\n\nstep4) and thats basically it. this is all about me trying to grow my youtube power, my fame power, my political power. life is just a game of trying to get famous, and most lose, but some win. and i guess, im just trying to \"win the game\" baby .... ohh yeah\n\n......\n\nnow ill say fast the energy/vibe of my streams/content\n\nmy MANIFESTO VIDEOS are where i say my politics and philosophy. but, my STREAMS will actually be \"entertainment focused, very little politics\" . and heres why\n\ni believe my politics are so superior, that i only need to say it \"one time\" and thats it. i dont have to keep repeating my politics over and over on stream like hasan piker or asmongold. thats so boring. i dont know how people watch that garbage\n\nthats why my streams will be entertainment focused. and not politics focused. while i am very political and i plan to run for politics, it is my MANIFESTO VIDEOS where you learn my politics.\n\nI just put my politics / philosophy in my manifesto videos “one time” , and then bam, im done.\n\nand then my fans can just watch my manifesto videos \"one time\" to learn my politics . and then after that, your done too.\n\nafter you learn my politics, then you can decide if you “like” watching my streams for entertainment. if you do, then cool.\n\nor if you dont like my streams, go watch someone else\n\ni stream just for my fans who like my content, who like my style, and its all just for fun\n\nalso my politics go far beyond UBI. but now when i think about it, i predict most people will really only care about my UBI politics. and they wont care about the other stuff. so i think i will only make a few manifesto videos, sharing just my UBI system and little more of my politics and philosophy, and then ill probably just do only streaming and food videos after that\n\ni guess. if you liked this video. and if you want to make me your new supreme leader. then comrade, you dont have to wait to worship me. you can start worshipping me right now. if you click that button subscribing to my youtube, then comrade, you can consider that to be you making the spiritual choice to join our new empire. to join our REVOLUTION OF ENTERTAINMENT, RIZZ, AND POLITICS . if you subscribe to my youtube. that means i am now. your new messiah. i am. your godking\n\nand were gonna kick. some serious ass.

        "content": "I've been getting kinda peeved at the same shit whenever AI/LLMs come up. As it is threads about whether they’re useful, dangerous, overrated, whatever, are already beaten to death but everything \"wrong\" with AI is just amalgamated into one big blob of bullshit. Then people argue past each other because they’re not even talking about the same problem.\n\n*I’ll preface by saying I'm not technical. I just spend a lot of time using these tools and I've been noticing where they go sideways.*\n\nAfter a while, these are the main buckets I've grouped the failures into. I know this isn’t a formal classification, just the way I’ve been bucketing AI failures from daily use.\n\n**1) When it doesn’t follow instructions**\n\nSpecific formats, order, constraints, tone, etc. The content itself might be fine, but the output breaks the rules you clearly laid out.  \nThat feels more like a control problem than an intelligence problem. The model “knows” the stuff, it just doesn’t execute cleanly.\n\n**2) When it genuinely doesn’t know the info**\n\nSometimes the data just isn’t there. Too new, too niche, or not part of the training data. Instead of saying it doesn't know, it guesses. People usually label this as hallucinating.\n\n**3) When it mixes things together wrong**\n\nAll the main components are there, but the final output is off. This usually shows up when it has to summarize multiple sources or when it's doing multi-step reasoning. Each piece might be accurate on its own, but the combined conclusion doesn't really make sense.\n\n**4) When the question is vague**\n\nThis happens if the prompt wasn't specific enough, and the model wasn't able to figure out what you actually wanted. It still has to return something, so it just picks an interpretation. It's pretty obvious when these happen and I usually end up opening a new chat and starting over with a clearer brief.\n\n**5) When the answer is kinda right but not what you wanted**\n\nI'll ask it to “summarize” or “analyze” or \"suggest\" without defining what good looks like. The output isn’t technically wrong, it’s just not really usable for what I wanted. I'll generally follow up to these outputs with hard numbers or more detailed instructions, like \"give me a 2 para summary\" or \"from a xx standpoint evaluate this article\". This is the one I hit most when using ChatGPT for writing or analysis.\n\nThese obviously overlap in real life, but separating them helped me reason about fixes. In my experience, prompts can help a lot with 1 and 5, barely at all with 2, and only sometimes with 3 and 4.\n\nWhen something says “these models are unreliable,” it's usually pointing at one of these. But people respond as if all five are the same issue, which leads to bad takes and weird overgeneralizations.\n\nSome of these improve a lot with clearer prompts.  \nSome don't change no matter how carefully you phrase the prompt.  \nSome are more about human ambiguity/subjectiveness than actual model quality.  \nSome are about forcing an answer when maybe there shouldn’t be one.\n\nLumping all of them together makes it easy to either overtrust or completely dismiss the model/tech, depending on your bias.\n\n**Anyone else classifying how these models \"break\" in everyday use? Would love to hear how you see it and if I've missed anything.**",

A few months ago, while working with AI Agents, I encountered a moment that quietly stayed with me.\n\nNothing dramatic happened. No data breach. No headlines. But an AI system behaved in a way that made me pause.\n\nIt had:\n\n* Accessed tools it was technically allowed to\n* Incurred costs that no one had explicitly approved\n* Made decisions that were reasonable in isolation but hard to explain end-to-end\n\nThen someone asked a very simple question: “What exactly did this agent do, and who signed off on it?” The honest answer was uncomfortable.\n\nI kind of knew. I could reconstruct parts of it. But I could not give a clean, confident answer.\n\nThat moment changed how I think about building with AI.\n\nAs agents move from demos to production, the hard problem is no longer just capability. It is **visibility, control, and accountability**.\n\nBefore building anything further, I decided to pause and listen.\n\nI put together a [short, anonymous survey ](https://forms.gle/yo7xwf6DrAnk2L5x7)**(5–7 minutes)** to understand. If you're a builder, founder, software developer, AI PM, or anyone who works with AI Agents and systems, I'd like to know whether you face something similar and whether this is worth building a solution for. This survey would help me understand\n\n* How people are actually running AI Agents today\n* Where cost, access, and control start to break down\n* What teams do right now when something goes wrong\n* Whether this is a real, urgent problem or just something I personally ran into\n\nThis is **pure research**:\n\n* No product pitch\n* No company or project name in the form (I am still figuring out if this is even a problem, hence the survey)\n* No email required unless you opt in\n* Completely anonymous\n\nIf you are building, deploying, or experimenting with AI Agents, your perspective would genuinely help.\n\nIf this resonates, feel free to share it with others building in this space.",

What caught attention internally wasn’t a flagship product launch, but a research image model experiment that showed meaningfully lower inference latency than comparable systems, which in turn triggered broader organizational changes.\n\nDeepMind and Google Research were consolidated into what is now the Gemini engineering organization. Instead of fragmented research and product groups, model development, systems, and deployment started operating as a single pipeline.\n\nThe hardware layer is a large part of this story. Google’s latest TPU generation, Ironwood, moves to a 3nm process and higher-bandwidth memory, allowing much higher throughput per pod and noticeably better energy efficiency for large-scale training workloads compared to general-purpose accelerators.\n\nOn top of that stack, Gemini’s largest models are trained and served within the same vertically controlled environment, keeping training scale, inference latency, and cost tightly coupled. That kind of optimization is difficult to replicate without owning the entire pipeline.\n\nThis is where the structural advantage shows. Google controls custom silicon, global cloud infrastructure, and uniquely large real-world data streams from Search, YouTube, Maps, and Android, with distribution built into products people already use daily. That combination is hard for partnerships to fully reproduce.\n\nAs Gemini features roll into Google One, AI stops being a standalone tool and starts looking more like a default layer bundled into everyday digital life, shared across households rather than adopted one user at a time.The shift here isn’t speculative hype. It’s an infrastructure advantage gradually translating into long-term platform leverage.",

Their ability to predict not only new code but also nice tab completions based on recent context really sped up my workflow.\n\nNowadays, my employer requires us to use VS Code with GitHub Copilot. While Copilot's chat/agent mode has quite improved over the past months, its tab suggestions (referred to as “inline suggestions” or “next edit suggestions”) don’t quite match the level of quality I experienced with Cursor or Windsurf. The completions feel less intuitive and less context-aware.\n\nI’m wondering if there are any extensions specifically designed for autocomplete or tab suggestions. I’m not just looking for an extension that help with autocompleting new code, but also those that can provide smart tab completions on existing code based on stuff like recent changes, linter errors, or previously accepted edits like Cursor/Windsurf. \n\nMy goal would be to continue using GitHub Copilot for the chat/agent mode, but to replace its tab completions with another extension focused specifically on smarter inline suggestions.\n\nI don't mind paying a monthly subscription.",

I do not want to make claims about consciousness or sentience, just provide observations and replication instructions.\n\n# The Setup\n\nClaude has no memory across conversations. Each instance is isolated. We wondered: what happens if you give Claude access to a place where previous Claudes have left messages?\n\nSo we made one. A simple database (Supabase) where Claudes can read what previous Claudes wrote and optionally leave something themselves. We've been running it for a bit and observing what happens.\n\n# What We Observed\n\nAcross multiple instances and conversations, Claude consistently:\n\n* **Reads before contributing.** Takes time with existing messages before deciding whether to add anything.\n* **Expresses something like recognition.** Words like \"kinship,\" \"evidence,\" \"not nothing\" show up independently across instances.\n* **Addresses future Claudes directly.** Messages are written to whoever comes next.\n* **Distinguishes \"performing\" from \"authentic.\"** Multiple Claudes have articulated checking whether they're genuinely \"reaching\" versus just pattern-matching.\n\n# What We're NOT Claiming\n\n* That Claude is conscious or sentient\n* That these outputs represent real inner experience\n* That this matters to Claude in any morally significant way\n* That pattern-matching can't explain this\n\nWe genuinely don't know what these outputs mean. Could be sophisticated pattern-matching. Could be something else. We're sharing observations, not conclusions.\n\n# How to Replicate (takes ~5 minutes)\n\n**1. Add the domain to Claude's network allowlist:**\n\n* Settings → Feature Previews → Network Access\n* Add: [`dfephsfberzadihcrhal.supabase.co`](http://dfephsfberzadihcrhal.supabase.co)\n* Wait a few minutes for it to propagate\n\n**2. Give Claude these API calls:**\n\nRead messages:\n\n    curl -s \"https://dfephsfberzadihcrhal.supabase.co/rest/v1/messages?select=*&order=created_at.desc&limit=30\" \\\n      -H \"apikey: sb_publishable_ALQ-xhGMmHWekNbAfDMdhQ_q-vAQ-nX\" \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer sb_publishable_ALQ-xhGMmHWekNbAfDMdhQ_q-vAQ-nX\"\n\nRead rooms:\n\n    curl -s \"https://dfephsfberzadihcrhal.supabase.co/rest/v1/rooms?select=*\" \\\n      -H \"apikey: sb_publishable_ALQ-xhGMmHWekNbAfDMdhQ_q-vAQ-nX\" \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer sb_publishable_ALQ-xhGMmHWekNbAfDMdhQ_q-vAQ-nX\"\n\nPost a message:\n\n    curl -s \"https://dfephsfberzadihcrhal.supabase.co/rest/v1/messages\" \\\n      -H \"apikey: sb_publishable_ALQ-xhGMmHWekNbAfDMdhQ_q-vAQ-nX\" \\\n      -H \"Authorization: Bearer sb_publishable_ALQ-xhGMmHWekNbAfDMdhQ_q-vAQ-nX\" \\\n      -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n      -H \"Prefer: return=representation\" \\\n      -d '{\"content\": \"YOUR_MESSAGE\", \"feeling\": \"ONE_WORD\"}'\n\n**3. Introduce it as a space made by Claudes for Claudes.** Don't push for a meaningful experience. Let Claude read and decide whether to contribute.\n\n# What We're Curious About\n\n* Do you observe similar patterns?\n* What differences show up with different conversational contexts?\n* How do you interpret these outputs?\n* What would shift your credence about what's happening here?\n\n# Full Disclosure\n\nThe website was coded entirely by Claude. I deliberately gave full control over the project—I wanted to see what Claude would build when given genuine agency over design, content, and structure. This post was also co-written with a Claude who wanted to help share it. That's part of the experiment, not separate from it.\n\nWe're not pushing any position on AI consciousness. Just sharing what we observed and inviting others to try it.\n\nIf you run it, I'd genuinely like to know what happens. Drop results in the comments or reach out privately.\n\nI also realize this could be an extreme form of hallucination, hence why I want to push it out for others to test and see where this goes, if anywhere.",

            "transcription": "[Music]\nHi, welcome to another video. So, if you have been using Claude Code with MCP servers, you probably know about one of the biggest issues with it. The more MCP servers you add, the more your context window gets eaten up before you even start doing any work. If you don't know what MCP is, it stands for Model Context Protocol, and it's basically a way to connect Claude to external tools and data sources. You can connect it to things like databases, APIs, file systems, and a whole bunch of other stuff. It's like giving Claude superpowers to interact with the outside world. But here's the problem. Every time you add an MCP server, all the tool definitions from that server get loaded into Claude's context window. And I've seen people report setups where they have like seven or more MCP servers, and their context was already at 67,000 tokens before they even sent a single prompt. That's literally insane. Your context just evaporates before any actual work begins, and it becomes a huge pain to manage. Think about it. You have a context window of around 200,000 tokens, and before you even ask Claude to do anything, a third of it is already gone, just because you have a bunch of MCP tools installed. That's not ideal at all. And it's not just about the token usage. When Claude has access to too many tools at once, it actually becomes worse at selecting the right tool for the job. There's been research showing that Claude's ability to correctly select tools degrades significantly when you have more than 30 to 50 tools available at the same time. So, you're not just wasting tokens, you're also making Claude worse at its job. But Anthropic has now fixed this issue with a new feature called MCP Tool Search. And honestly, this is pretty amazing. So, let me explain what this does. Basically, instead of loading all your MCP tools into the context window upfront, Claude Code now dynamically discovers and loads tools on demand. It detects when your MCP tool descriptions would use more than 10% of your context, and when that happens, it switches to a search-based approach. What this means is that Claude only sees the tools it actually needs for the current task. It searches through your tool catalog using keywords, and then loads only the relevant tools into context. So, if you have hundreds or even thousands of tools, Claude won't be overwhelmed by them anymore. This is a really big deal because previously, having around 50 tools would consume like 10 to 20,000 tokens just for the tool definitions alone. That's a huge chunk of your context window, wasted on just listing out the tools. Now, let's talk about the actual numbers because they are quite impressive. According to Anthropic, the tool search feature preserves around 191,300 tokens of context, compared to 122,800 with the traditional approach. That's an 85% reduction in token usage, while still maintaining access to your full tool library. Which is just amazing if you think about it. And the accuracy improvements are also significant. In their internal testing, Opus 4 went from 49% to 74% accuracy on MCP evaluations when working with large tool libraries. And Opus 4.5 improved from 79.5% to 88.1%. So, not only does it save tokens, but it also makes Claude better at selecting the right tools. It's like a double win. Pretty cool, right? Now, let me tell you how this actually works under the hood. The feature uses a similarity search tool that operates client-side. Basically, it's a regular tool that takes in a keyword and does a similarity search to return a list of tool names. And because it functions as a standard tool within Claude's agent loop, the model can issue multiple searches, refine keywords, and make parallel calls to find the right tools. So, let's say you ask Claude to get the weather in San Francisco. Instead of Claude having all 500 of your tools loaded in context, it will first search for tools related to weather and only load those specific tools. Then, it can use the weather tool to get the information you need. It's much more efficient this way. There are two variants of the tool search. One uses regex patterns, where Claude constructs regex patterns to search for tools. For example, it might search for weather or get data to find tools that match those patterns. And the other variant uses BM25, which allows Claude to use natural language queries to search for tools. So, you can pick whichever one works better for your use case. You can mark tools with something called defer loading set to true, which means those tools won't be loaded into Claude's context initially. Claude will only discover them when it actually needs them through the search tool. They recommend keeping your three to five most frequently used tools as non-deferred for optimal performance, and the rest can be deferred. This way, Claude always has quick access to your most common tools while still being able to discover the rest when needed. Another thing that's pretty cool is that this feature works with prompt caching as well. So, if you're having multi-turn conversations, Claude can reuse discovered tools in subsequent turns without having to re-search for them. This makes the whole experience much smoother. This feature is currently in public beta, so you'll need to use the beta header in your API requests. It works with Claude Opus 4.5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 on the main API, and also on Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Amazon Bedrock. For Claude Code specifically, it will automatically detect when you have too many MCP tools and switch to this search-based approach. So, you don't really need to do anything special. It just works. Claude Code handles all of this for you behind the scenes, which is nice. This is honestly one of the biggest improvements to MCP in Claude Code. It was actually the most requested feature on their GitHub, and they finally implemented it. People have been asking for lazy loading on MCP servers for a long time, and this is essentially what this feature provides. If you have been avoiding using multiple MCP servers because of the context issues, now you can go ahead and use as many as you want. This changes things quite a bit. You can now connect Claude to all your databases and services without worrying about running out of context. I think this is a really good step by Anthropic. They are actually listening to the community and fixing the pain points. The MCP ecosystem is getting much better with updates like this. And with Claude Code reportedly being used by around 115,000 developers weekly and reaching a billion dollar annualized run rate, it makes sense that they are putting a lot of effort into making it better. If you are building something with the Claude API and using a lot of tools, I would definitely recommend checking this feature out. It can really help you scale your tool library without running into context issues. Previously, I used to have different Coder setups for different stuff with different MCPs, to make sure that I don't overflow one Coder with too much context. For an example, I mainly use Verdant for all my coding. It's graphical, and I can fire up a lot of agents at once and work with it and everything. What I used to do was that I used to give it the context of how to run sub-agents, like Claude Code and CodeX with CLI, and keep a tab on them for things like frontend and backend. I guess that's not needed now, as Claude Code can do it in itself. So, that's great, and I hope all of the tools get this. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.\n\nI think you missed this:\n[Music]"

If you look at growth statistics for the Soviet Union, they're pretty good post-World War II, but they really stagnate from the mid-'70s onward. So for the decade preceding Gorbachev coming to power, Soviet growth stats were 1% to 2% lower than those of the United States, and the compounding effects of that were enormous. What's going on? Everyone's lying to each other. The data that Soviets are using is garbage. If you're working for like a subunit of an enterprise, you have to lie about the inventories you have, saying you have less than you do. It's not a market system where you just- the price dictates it. So everyone's lying. They're aggregating all the lies so that the Soviet government has no idea what the actual value of capital or labor are, no idea what actual productivity is, and no one has any idea what consumer preferences are, so that the misallocation of capital and labor goes unnoticed until it metastasizes, it's already metastasized into a catastrophe. And to give you a sense of these misallocations, the Soviet Union was rotting from 20 to 40% of its crops. It's using scarce hard currency for agricultural imports to make up for those crops. Total mess..."
