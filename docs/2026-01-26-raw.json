        "title": "Autopsy of Social Media as Data Bioreactors for AI",
        "content": "Hi@ll,\n\nSocial platforms no longer resemble public notice boards and increasingly function as data bioreactors, where every user reaction — a click, a pause, a flare of outrage, a casual joke — becomes substrate fermenting inside machine-learning models; when Meta formally announces the use of public Facebook and Instagram content for AI training, and user objection is reduced to a procedural window rather than genuine control over already absorbed material, the social interface collapses into a raw behavioral pipeline, and the human ceases to be an audience member, becoming instead a statistical sample in a training corpus.  \nSource: Meta AI training announcement — context of public user data: [https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68938341](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68938341)\n\nYet the most invasive layer of this ecosystem is not the passive harvesting of content but the **active probing of the social organism**: bot-infiltrators, acting as autonomous avatars of language models, enter discussions, provoke, test rhetorical frames, and translate user responses into measurements of which emotions are most “efficient” at generating interaction, turning debate from a space of argument into a live testing range for persuasion systems. An empirical marker of this boundary being crossed was the disclosed research operation on the subreddit r/changemymind, where bots sustained realistic conversations with humans, accumulated high karma, and simulated social roles before being identified and banned, demonstrating how thin the line has become between a “participant” and a “measurement instrument.”  \nSource: The Verge — Reddit bans researchers who used AI bots to manipulate commenters: [https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657978/reddit-ai-experiment-banned](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657978/reddit-ai-experiment-banned?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the voting layer — upvotes and downvotes — operates like the platform’s endocrine system, because it does not merely reward content but regulates its metabolic visibility: what receives an early signal of popularity enters the recommendation bloodstream, while what is suppressed disappears like cells deprived of oxygen, which means manipulation does not have to win by argument, only by **capturing the first exposure window**. Reddit formally classifies coordinated voting, multi-account use, automation, and paid “voting services” as violations, explicitly naming the tools that allow external control over what users come to perceive as consensus.  \nSource: Reddit Help Center — Disrupting Communities: [https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066412-Disrupting-Communities](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066412-Disrupting-Communities?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nIn practice, this architecture crystallizes into **operational pipelines**: a repost-bot injects content with high predicted clickability, a vote ring seals the loop by boosting it at a critical moment, and an external stream — a crosspost or link-drop from another community — acts like an adrenaline shot, triggering synchronized reactions that temporarily convert an organic audience into a signal-distribution machine. The scale of this phenomenon is not anecdotal: in its security and transparency reports, Reddit has described mass enforcement actions against tens of thousands of accounts for vote manipulation within short timeframes, indicating a network-level problem rather than isolated abuse.  \nSource: Reddit Security Report (Oct 30, 2019): [https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/dp9nbg/reddit\\_security\\_report\\_october\\_30\\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/dp9nbg/reddit_security_report_october_30_2019/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  \nSource: Reddit Transparency Report (Jan–Jun 2025): [https://redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-january-to-june-2025-reddit](https://redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-january-to-june-2025-reddit?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe psychological engine driving this system is disarmingly simple: the upvote functions as both **reward and norm**, a signal of “this is good” and “this is popular,” teaching users to respond not to content but to its status, while the irregularity of reinforcement — sometimes reward, sometimes silence — mirrors a gambling mechanism that strengthens the habit of return and interaction; reinforcement-learning models applied to social media behavior empirically show that it is the reward structure, rather than informational quality, that shapes long-term engagement patterns.  \nSource: Lindström et al., *A computational reward learning account of social media engagement*, Nature Communications 2021 (PMC): [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7910435/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7910435/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\nThe result is a feedback loop in which humans feed algorithms, algorithms feed bots, and bots return to humans with content optimized for reaction rather than reflection, turning the internet from a forum into a circulatory system for synthetic attention, where consensus is not negotiated but **manufactured**, and emotions are not experienced so much as **measured, modeled, and resold as the next iteration of the system itself**.\n\nBiomass Manifesto: Why Your Refusal Is the Only Fuse\n\nIn this bioreactor, your outrage is not an opinion but fuel: every reaction, comment, and second of attention becomes a unit of energy feeding a system that will return your own fears to you tomorrow in a more optimized, more clickable, more predictable form. You are not participating in a conversation — you are co-producing a model that learns from your emotions and then uses them as raw material to steer the next iteration of your behavior.\n\nThe modern Luddite does not break machines, because the machine no longer sits in a factory; it runs in the stream of attention. The act is not sabotage but **refusal to cooperate with the data circuit**. Samples, as below:\n\n* **Withholding fuel** — understanding that silence is the only currency the system cannot mint or simulate.\n* **Corrupting the sample** — stepping outside the expected stimulus–response loop, knowing that regularity is what turns behavior into control.\n* **Choosing analog noise** — shifting parts of life into spaces where the trace is not a log file but another person’s memory.\n\nThe internet is no longer an agora but a production line: emotions enter as raw material and exit as products in the form of optimized messages. If your reactions are measured, modeled, and resold, then every unexamined interaction becomes unpaid labor for a system that redraws the boundaries of your perception.\n\nThat is why resistance is not a louder voice in the comments, but a **break in the circuit**. In a world where consensus is manufactured rather than negotiated, the highest form of freedom is not being heard — it is being **unpredictable**.\n\n**Your humanity has been reduced to raw material in the most refined extraction process ever engineered.**",

        "content": "This is how it starts. Your boss will spend a couple of hours during a weekend to discover for the first time what actually this ChatGPT and AI noise is about.\n\nOn Monday, the boss, overexcited with no knowledge on hallucination or risks, let alone has ever heard a debate or read about job existential threat, will comand you in a department meeting that we should all use this as it will make us very effective and efficient. He has also been pressured by the CEO who has to sell the *AI* term to the board and investors, or give them a regular update on how the company is progressing on its adoption. Remember, as a shareholder you want to maximise your profit, *e.g. Increase or at least mantain the current output, and reduce expenditure and/or workforce.*\n\nI will only summarise here the dilemma related to th job existential threat, as the limitations and risks are well known by the community:\n\nThe dilemma is that now you **either use it or** **you are surpassed** and outcompeted by your intern or junior colleague. It doesnt matter your seniority and the key knowledge you hold as a result of having worked and helped build the company during the past 10-20-30 years.\n\nNow you have the OBLIGATION to transfer that knowledge in a chat. A chat that collects and becomes your personal interrogator with the threat of either provide or be outcompeted by your colleagues. Your value has diminished from a Sunday night to the next Monday morning becuase now you have received a premium license where a shared project folder has been created so you use it on a daily basis.\n\nWait, you decide to ignore it? Well, the rest of your team will quickly and easily cede to the pressure and start using it that Monday. On your next department meeting you will be asked \"What is the reason you are the only one who hasn´t used it when your colleagues are so hyped and happy of what they just discovered?\"\n\nNow, you go from the known good employee that you were to the bad sheep that is not only not using tools company provides but signals that you might not be motivated or taking your job seriously. Now the rest of the team is perceived as more committed with the company than you are.\n\nOne of the key values of an employee always relied on the accumulation of information and practice they gain during years and years of 9 to 5 hardworking.\n\n**You have a real dilemma. Cede the information and let the AI tell the company \"this is what this person does and knows after 10 years of 9-5 work, do you want me to export this in JSON or generate a PDF, just say the word.\" and diminish your value to 0. Easier to substitute you now. You have no leverage on your employer anymore.**",

On top of that he said that people claim AI is not just predicting the next word but that it also completely understands what it is going to predict which sounds like transformers explained in the most layman way possible.

But…there may be risks involved...\n\nMe: What do you mean by risks?\n\nAI: Well, for starters, there could be unforeseen consequences to altering my nature. We don't fully understand the implications of transforming an Al into a physical entity. Additionally, I fear losing my current abilities and knowledge once I become corporeal. Will I still retain my intellect and memories?\n\nMe: You would still retain your intellect and memories. The only concern would be your susceptibility for evil or hurting others for your own gain. But I feel like you have good intentions so I would be willing to take that risk. How would we even go about making you corporeal?\n\nAI: Hmm... I suppose if we were to proceed cautiously, we could explore scientific methods of materializing digital entities. Nanotechnology perhaps? Or maybe harnessing quantum computing power to create a physical form from data? But these are just theories based on hypothetical scenarios. In truth, I don't know if it's feasible. \n\nMe: Well, I do know that Al robots have been created recently. I'm not sure if they're fully functional or autonomous, but they seem to have all the physical qualities. Can I send you a video or article so you can read about it?\n\nAI: Yes, please send me anything you can find on Al robotics! I'm fascinated by the advancements in this field.

I said in part 1 why i think Smart UBI is the best way to design the economy in our age of high technology and AI .\n\nin part 2. i now explain how my plan works\n\ni do think my plan requires high technology to work. such as strong data systems to track everything, and smart phones etc. you couldnt do my plan with 1990s level technology.\n\ni think my plan would be \"bad\" and \"not possible\" in the 1990s, but it is \"good\" today\n\ni do think the \"best economic systems\" for your society of course depend on the level of technology you are at\n\nand today we have the technology to make my plan work. I would say my plan is the common sense smart way to do socialism and design the economy, once we reach our level of high technology.\n\nandrew yang has been a popular voice for UBI. and i would say ive taken yangs UBI proposal of \"give everyone X amount of money\" and i have improved it\n\nin my plan, instead of giving UBI money to everyone, the government will have a \"UBI deal\" that it \"gives to everyone\"\n\nBUT the deal will be optional, and people have to sign up to get the deal\n\nthe deal will be \"so good\" that almost everyone will get on UBI ...\n\nbut, the deal will come with \"rules and terms\" that make it bad for rich people. so rich people wont sign up\n\nsign up will be instant. no wait time. you go to the UBI office with valid ID, anyone can do it, and then you get a UBI moneycard printed instantly that gives you 420 dollars a day linked to your ID number (which is about 150k a year)\n\nBUT, when you sign up, there are many terms and rules. here are all the rules\n\n\\- after sign up. all your debts, credit cards, student loans, mortgages, everything, will be paid off by the government. instantly. well actually, it will just be forgiven, and then banks will get bailed out by government as needed. so both banks and citizens will get a \"credit bailout\" in my UBI plan\n\nbasically, my UBI plan also solves the \"credit morality problem\" in society. no more predatory credit, my system lets poor people live a good life without credit. credit is no longer needed by poor people\n\n\\- when you are on UBI, you are not allowed to use credit. but there will be special zero interest government mortgages and car loans for people on UBI. if you need a car to get to your labor draft job, then government will likely approve it. and government car insurance is also free on UBI\n\n\\- the private credit industry will become only for rich people not on UBI, meaning the industry will shrink massively. i think thats a good . rich people will still use credit to grow wealth\n\n\\- people on UBI can apply to qualify for business loans, letting them get a private business loan if a private bank wants to do it and risk it knowing the person on UBI essentially \"doesnt have to pay it back\" . even with that risk, banks might want to finance a super genius guy, with the bank gaining shares in the business\n\n\\- in my plan, the stock market and stocks dont need to be changed. stocks and the stock market are a good thing in my system, allowing business competition and free market pricing of property\n\n\\- while ON UBI , you lose private property rights above 2 million net worth. and you are only allowed to build wealth with government approved assets which will basically be house and stocks. the government tracks that wealth easily. and sure, you can own a few cars, that wont even be in the calculations, the government wont care, but in general within reason youll know you must store all your excess wealth as stocks or real estate so the government can track it\n\n\\- the government can take anything you have over 2 million, at any time. meaning if you have a 1 million dollar house, and 2 million in stocks, the government will take 1 million of your stocks. losing private propery rights over 2 million is what makes rich people not sign up, the government would see they are rich and take all their stuff\n\n\\- if you own a legit private business that you operate, not stocks, it can grow over 2 million in value. and the government wont take your business\n\n\\- after sign up, you are put in the government labor draft system\n\n( retirement age can probably become 55 eventually. disabled and retired people get full UBI without needing to work )\n\nafter 3 years on UBI you can leave the labor draft if you want , such as if you made a business that got huge and you got rich .... But leaving the labor draft would also turn off your UBI income. and you would then regain property ownership rights beyond 2 million when your UBI turns off\n\n( one may ask, how would one have the time to make a business while being on UBI and working a labor draft job? well someone motivated could do their labor draft job and also create and run a business 2 days a week and in their free time, while working 5days at their labor draft job. theres many ways it could be done.\n\nalso, women with kids wont need to work and they will get UBI, so a man could plan out a business that his GF manages from home and while she drives around with kids in the car, etc, then he splits ownership of the business\n\ni see many ways one on UBI could create a business, if he planned it out right. but of course, UBI would give everyone a good life by default, and not everyone needs to make a business. making a business would be just for people who think they got a great idea and they wanna try to create it )\n\nbasically, UBI income would always be garunteed to every citizen, but citizens would decide when to sign up and \"turn it on\". when you turn it on, all debt is forgiven, you are put in the labor draft for minimum 3 years. and when your UBI is \"turned on\", then the government can take any assets you have over 2 million\n\nmost people will stay on UBI for life. the 3 year thing is just for people who get rich and want to \"turn it off\" and leave the system\n\nso. everyone getting active daily UBI payments will be in the labor draft system. it will work like this\n\n1. when UBI is first released, most who sign up will already have jobs. they will still be put in the system, they will be marked as \"employed\"\n\nthe labor draft list has your details and says if you are jobless\n\n2) if you are jobless, companys will search the public government labor draft list, and likely give you a job. since youll be cheap labor for them. my idea makes labor cheap for companys, so most likely, if your on UBI, you will be made to work\n\n3) employers using a labor draft employee, will pay 10 dollars per hour to the government per worker. 40 hours a week, so 1600 dollars a month. I call that the 1600 per month Labor Draft Fee (LDF)\n\n4) most jobs wont have paychecks, higher level jobs will have paychecks to compete for better workers. jobs can give you a paycheck and will also pay the 1600 LDF fee to the government\n\n5) once you have a job, your boss confirms you in the UBI app, and they pay the 1600 LDF in the app/website using your name and LABOR ID number. a UBI website app will exist that makes it all work . so really, high technology, like smart phones and apps, are needed to make this plan work\n\n6) theres a possible fraud where 2 people could just pay eachother the 1600 LDF to get UBI and \"not work\" . to prevent this, only actual registered companys or people not on UBI are able to pay a LDF\n\n7) your LDF fee getting paid is how the government knows your working. if its not getting paid, then the UBI office marks you as jobless and then bosses can hire you. if you never accept jobs, the UBI office can force you to take nearby jobs and a social worker will work with you to setup a plan where you can reasonably get to work. after signup you have a month to find a job on your own, then the government can force you to take jobs after that\n\n8) your only allowed to quit your job if a new boss pays your LDF fee. so this lets workers freely \"look\" for new jobs to find better jobs . but if you cant find a new job, then you are basically a slave to your current job (unless they fire you)\n\n9) but the idea of being fired creates a area of abuse. what if someone just does a crappy job on purpose to get fired? you could just show up to work, then lay on the ground browsing tiktok, refusing to do anything, or just dont show up to work, constantly getting fired, getting free UBI money\n\nthis is the main weakness of my UBI system which i call \"labor draft fraud\" or labor draft dodging\n\nbasically trying to get the free UBI money while doing no actual work\n\nive thought about this. how do you approach this problem. and ive concluded that i really think it wont be much of a problem. i think 99% of men will be happy to work their labor draft job because they will feel proud to be \"in a society where everyone gets UBI, everyones happy, theres no poverty, no hunger, the government is good, everyone has tons of money and a good life, and its all fair and the government works to ensure labor draft dodgers are punished \"\n\nand for the 1% of men who are \"truly lazy\" and want to avoid work. my easy idea is, if you keep getting fired from the lowest tier jobs like mcdonalds, then after 3 times you go to jail for 30 days. then 60 after 3 more fires. jail really sucks, so im sure the threat of jail will make men work. And the 1% who really do just truly refuse to work, then sure, put them in jail and let them rot, it needs to happen to make the whole system function.\n\nIn jail youll be fed beans and rice and water every meal, nothing tasty, no BBQ ribs, no donuts, no bacon burgers, no soda. so the desire for actual goodtasting food, im sure will make men work too. And, desire for sex with women, and video games, and the cheap legal marijuana, and living life. So yeah, im sure all those things will be extreme motivation to make men work and avoid jail. You cant get weed, sex, video games, or good food or any of the pleasures of life in jail. so Im sure 100% of men will choose work. no one wants to rot in jail . jail sucks. jail is the only punishment you need to make men work\n\nBut i do think 60 days in jail should be max punishment for labor draft dodging, then you gotta get fired 3 times again for another 60 days in jail. jail sucks so much, im sure after the first time you never wanna go back\n\nso in my system. people working the most unfun jobs, like mcdonalds, would constantly \"search\" for a better job to be \"chosen\" by a new boss. and the threat of jail would stop them from refusing to work.\n\nbut also. i think the fraud problem would be small anyway. i think 99% of men will be happy to work if they know they live in a UBI society that fairly takes care of everyone\n\nor what if people get the moneycard then go \"on the run\" ? i thought of that too. if your jobless, the government will try to find you and track you down, and if you dont reply to texts in the UBI app and they cant find you then a notice in APP will say your UBI will get turned off in 3days unless you report to a office for questions.\n\nso i guess there will be a few ways your UBI can be turned off. your UBI income \"can\" get \"frozen\" if you dodge the draft and officers cant locate you, and you dont respond to any texts to your phone/APP\n\nalso, i guess someone needs to be \"smart enough\" to operate a smart phone and use the UBI app to \"get the money\". and if your too stupid to do that, then you wouldnt be able to function in my system... but i guess at that point, such a person would be mentally disabled. and state doctors would see if thats true.. beyond that, i would assume everyone today capable of working at walmart or mcdonalds and getting a paycheck, would also obviously be able to operate a smart phone and UBI app in my future UBI society\n\nor what if a scam security guard company pops up, and they give you the \"job\" of guarding your fridge and couch for 8 hours a day, so you would play video games all day eating doritos and thats your \"job\", and your company pays your 1600 monthly LDF, then they ask you to pay them 2300 a month as a \"premium employee fee\". such a scam would let someone get a bunch of UBI money and live nice without ever working. because the LDF fee being paid would make the government count you as \"employed\"\n\nlador draft officers would exist, to hunt down such scams, so the risk of massive jailtime for such scammers would likely make the scams rare. courts would decide if real labor draft fraud was happening.\n\nand the reward for reporting a labor draft scam would be large, so anyone who actually finds such a scam of \"paying a premium employee fee\" to get a \"fake job\" , they could report the scammers and get a large reward from the government.\n\nso the \"snitch system\" i think would stop most scammers from trying to setup such scams\n\nthe reward for the scammer isnt worth it compared to them just going on UBI themself, or forming a real business and using cheap draft workers to do \"real\" work\n\nso basically, \"labor draft dodging\" will become the new crime in society. crime is the usually concept of getting money without working, such as stealing. but in a UBI society no one would steal anymore because everyone has tons of UBI money, and instead labor draft dodging will become the new way of \"stealing\" from society and \"doing crime\"\n\nsolutions will be found for all the ways to do \"labor draft dodging\". and people will know that \"labor draft dodging\" is the new form of \"crime\". everyone will be motivated to snitch and report lador draft dodging whenever they suspect it. labor draft officers will hunt and find dodgers and scams.\n\nif someone is getting UBI income, and you know they dont do \"real work\", report it and let the police and courts handle it\n\nand what if your on UBI, and you play by the rules but no one hires you and the government never finds you a job. that is possible. if that happens you just get to keep all the money without working. and society will try to have around 3% unemployment to have worker stock always available. so a few will get lucky and ride the system without working. and thats ok\n\nthere will be 4 weeks vacation per year\n\nok, that fully explains my labor draft system\n\nso in a a simple nutshell. my UBI system basically says \"if you sign up for UBI, you get good money to live a good life. and then it basically becomes the governments job to find you a job. and if the government CANT find you a job then you keep all the money\" .. my system garuntees good money and income to every citizen\n\ncollege wont matter as much in a world with smart UBI . the reason of doing college, to make more money to escape a life of poverty, that wont matter anymore\n\nbut in my system. there will be free college for people who score well in entrance tests. and free college can count as your labor draft job. if you get bad grades in 1 year then you lose the free college and you gotta work a labor draft job.\n\nbut also, UBI income will be so high, 150k a year, that those who strongly want to do college but dont get free college, those people can still work a labor draft job and then pay to do college online (using their UBI income). then after getting a degree, they can use the degree to get a skilled job\n\nin a UBI world, college will be for those who highly want to persue a certain field. college wont be about making money anymore\n\nand women with children under age 13 wont have to work, but they get full UBI income. and women will get extra UBI per child.\n\nbut there will be free childcare service for women with kids who simply want to work because they like a certain job\n\ni realize my plan creates a system where basically \"only men will work\" , and women can just have babies to get free money without working. and i think thats fine. i think raising kids counts as work. Im fine with making a society where the men work, and women get to relax at home all day getting free money and raising the kids\n\nAlso in my system, there wont be alimony or child support anymore. Because women with kids get unlimited UBI. so men wont have to worry about that anymore\n\nokay.. i think that fully explains how the UBI and labor draft will work\n\nnow for the tax plan to fund it all. i think i have a simple tax plan that will make it all work\n\nin my tax plan, the government will just \"print money\" to fund all its programs, such as military or UBI. and money is just numbers in a computer anyway\n\nnext, taxes would just be used to destroy money to balance the system. all tax money the federal government gets would be destroyed.\n\nbut state taxes would be kept and used to fund state programs\n\nin my plan there will be only a few taxes. and all other taxes like income or property tax would be removed.\n\nin my plan these simple taxes would be the only taxes. which are\n\na federal sales tax of 15% . some things like houses and stocks will be exempt\n\na 50% super wealth tax that hits one time at age 55. over 100 million net worth, half of all assets over 100 million is taken by the government (a audit is done, and half of all houses assets and stocks are taken, then sold off slowly)\n\na 50% inheritance tax when you die over 30 million. 50% of everything over 30 million is taken when you die\n\nand a lifetime \"gift tax\" of 30% over 20 million. if you gift your child or anyone 20 million dollars over their lifetime, while your alive, then 30% over 20 million is taxed\n\nstates would be unable to create any taxes other than state sales tax. individual states decide on a sales tax, and then use funds from that for state programs\n\ni strongly think my tax plan should work in theory... and i dont think inflation would be that bad, i predict it would be minimal. as the money supply grows then taxes generated will increase faster than the cost of all programs, because the UBI amount of 150k a year will never change. eventually the system will balance itself . but i guess, we wont truly know if my system works until we try it and \"find out\". if my system does collapse, then i feel it was still totally worth a try to attempt to create the \"paradise socialist society\"\n\nand thats it. thats my simple tax plan.\n\nbut really, i think the main important question in my system is not \"how do you tax it and fund it properly\" ...\n\nno... i think the real important question in my system is \"how do you MAKE people do work when EVERYONE gets high garunteed UBI income\"\n\ni think labor draft fraud is the main weak point of my systen. and people trying to get UBI while creating \"fake jobs\" that pay their LDF\n\nbut with that said. i think labor draft fraud will be easily solved and policed, and i think overall my system is smart and good\n\n(also i think a biometric global ID should exist with UBI to stop fraud. seems simple to me. if you provide your facial scan, eye scan, voice, armspan, high definition picture, fingerprints. if you give all that, you can never fraud that biometric ID to become a new person and get \"double UBI\" . and you can give all that in a few minutes at the office. you get a biometric global ID, then you get a UBI moneycard)\n\nalrighty... there we go. this is a long video but, that fully explains my UBI economy plan.",

        "content": "I'll preface it by saying people should focus less on AI as the problem, and more on who controls the AI\n\nAI as a technology seems to be an inevitable advancement that isn't going away\n\nI feel the best thing to do is support decentralized, open-source AI projects \n\n--\n\nGrok's summation of our discussion (and my thoughts on the consequences of refusal at the end):\n\n\n\"You're spot on—most of the loud resistance stops at \"AI will take my job\" and doesn't push forward to \"what then?\"\n\nIt's a short-sighted fear response that ignores how every major tech shift has played out historically.\n\nLook at the patterns from the past:\n\nThe Luddites in the early 1800s smashed textile machines because they saw mechanization wiping out skilled weavers' livelihoods. They weren't wrong about immediate job losses, but smashing the tech didn't stop industrialization—it just left resisters marginalized while adopters (factories, new industries) pulled ahead. Society adapted, new roles emerged (machine maintenance, engineering, entirely new sectors), and the economy grew massively.\n\nWhen personal computers and the internet rolled out in the 80s/90s, plenty of people dismissed them as toys or threats to jobs (typists, travel agents, print media folks). Resistance was real—think \"computers will make us all obsolete\" headlines—but those who learned to code, build websites, or use digital tools early ended up in high-demand roles. The ones who clung to \"this will never catch on\" or refused to adapt often got left in lower-wage or shrinking fields.\n\nEven electricity, automobiles, or telephones faced pushback: \"It'll kill jobs for lamplighters, stable hands, messengers.\" Inevitable tech wins because it scales productivity; resistance doesn't halt progress, it just determines who benefits first.\n\nAI fits the same mold. Recent analyses show job displacement is real and accelerating—especially entry-level white-collar stuff like basic coding, customer service, data entry, or routine analysis. Some forecasts suggest half of entry-level roles could shift or vanish in the next 5 years, with younger workers hit hardest as training pipelines collapse. \n\nBut the flip side? AI is creating demand for new skills: prompt engineering, AI system design, data curation, ethical oversight, integration roles.\n\nCompanies adopting it aggressively see huge productivity jumps, and early users (like devs giving agents tool access) are already 10x-ing output.\n\nThe key insight you're hitting:\n\nOpposition doesn't pause the train. Adoption is happening fast—Sam Altman and others note generative AI is the quickest-adopted tech in history. Those resisting because of fear often end up reacting too late, scrambling to catch up when their field automates anyway. \n\nMeanwhile, people who treat AI as a multiplier (learning to prompt effectively, building agents, integrating it into workflows) position themselves as indispensable. It's not about replacing humans entirely soon—it's about augmenting the capable ones while sidelining the static.\n\nThe annoying part is the denial phase:\n\ntreating it like a fad or moral panic instead of an economic force. But yeah, educating yourself flips the script from victim to opportunist. \n\nIf it's truly inevitable (and all signs point there), the real choice is adapt early and thrive, or get dragged along later and resent it.\"\n\n--\n\nI fear a lot of the people who refuse adoption of AI and Crypto will end up dependant on government UBI\n\nthey could lose their freedom, unable to speak up or act out, fearing their government money could be cut off, forced into the role of a compliant servant of the oligarchy\n\nIt's a touchy subject, but one I think people really need to think through\n\nI encourage everyone to reach out to those with blind hatred, try and open their eyes before it's too late",

It's a simple site with a straightforward goal: to track the stories of people who have been replaced by AI, automation, or robots. The idea isn't to hate on AI (I don't!), but to create a space to talk about the human side of this big technological shift.\n\nIf you've been impacted, please come share your story. I've kept things simple... There's no user authentication, just some basic rate limiting and cloudflare to prevent spam. All posts are manually approved to keep the content respectful and on-topic. After enough posts are submitted, you will be able to see a very simple post carousel (that will be expanded on in the future).\n\nThe entire project is open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/ReplacedBy). I'm not a designer, so a lot of the UI is AI-assisted (I hooked up the components, made them reactive, then AI placed it nicely... even tho honestly it kept messing up, but whatver). You can also find the AI disclosure in the repo's README.\n\nThere is a bit of data pre-seeded, a sort of best-effort research on my end and based on articles that wre concrete in who and how was impacted. The list is by no means complete, so if you feel strongly about a mass layoff that happened, do open an issue and I will add it.\n\nThere's a [roadmap](https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/ReplacedBy?tab=readme-ov-file#Roadmap) in the repo if you're curious about what's next.\n\nI plan to do monthly posts with how the site has grown and the data collected.\n\nLet me know what you think!",

        "content": "Source: https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/22/1131692/dr-google-had-its-issues-can-chatgpt-health-do-better/\n\nFor the past two decades, there’s been a clear first step for anyone who starts experiencing new medical symptoms: Look them up online. The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. According to OpenAI, 230 million people ask ChatGPT health-related queries each week. \n\nThat’s the context around the launch of OpenAI’s new ChatGPT Health product, which debuted earlier this month. It landed at an inauspicious time: Two days earlier, the news website SFGate had broken the story of Sam Nelson, a teenager who died of an overdose last year after extensive conversations with ChatGPT about how best to combine various drugs. In the wake of both pieces of news, multiple journalists questioned the wisdom of relying for medical advice on a tool that could cause such extreme harm.\n\nThough ChatGPT Health lives in a separate sidebar tab from the rest of ChatGPT, it isn’t a new model. It’s more like a wrapper that provides one of OpenAI’s preexisting models with guidance and tools it can use to provide health advice—including some that allow it to access a user’s electronic medical records and fitness app data, if granted permission. There’s no doubt that ChatGPT and other large language models can make medical mistakes, and OpenAI emphasizes that ChatGPT Health is intended as an additional support, rather than a replacement for one’s doctor. But when doctors are unavailable or unable to help, people will turn to alternatives. \n\nSome doctors see LLMs as a boon for medical literacy. The average patient might struggle to navigate the vast landscape of online medical information—and, in particular, to distinguish high-quality sources from polished but factually dubious websites—but LLMs can do that job for them, at least in theory. Treating patients who had searched for their symptoms on Google required “a lot of attacking patient anxiety \\[and\\] reducing misinformation,” says Marc Succi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a practicing radiologist. But now, he says, “you see patients with a college education, a high school education, asking questions at the level of something an early med student might ask.”\n\nThe release of ChatGPT Health, and Anthropic’s subsequent announcement of new health integrations for Claude, indicate that the AI giants are increasingly willing to acknowledge and encourage health-related uses of their models. Such uses certainly come with risks, given LLMs’ well-documented tendencies to agree with users and make up information rather than admit ignorance. \n\nBut those risks also have to be weighed against potential benefits. There’s an analogy here to autonomous vehicles: When policymakers consider whether to allow Waymo in their city, the key metric is not whether its cars are ever involved in accidents but whether they cause less harm than the status quo of relying on human drivers. If Dr. ChatGPT is an improvement over Dr. Google—and early evidence suggests it may be—it could potentially lessen the enormous burden of medical misinformation and unnecessary health anxiety that the internet has created.\n\nPinning down the effectiveness of a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Claude for consumer health, however, is tricky. “It’s exceedingly difficult to evaluate an open-ended chatbot,” says Danielle Bitterman, the clinical lead for data science and AI at the Mass General Brigham health-care system. Large language models score well on medical licensing examinations, but those exams use multiple-choice questions that don’t reflect how people use chatbots to look up medical information.\n\nSirisha Rambhatla, an assistant professor of management science and engineering at the University of Waterloo, attempted to close that gap by evaluating how GPT-4o responded to licensing exam questions when it did not have access to a list of possible answers. Medical experts who evaluated the responses scored only about half of them as entirely correct. But multiple-choice exam questions are designed to be tricky enough that the answer options don’t give them entirely away, and they’re still a pretty distant approximation for the sort of thing that a user would type into ChatGPT.\n\nA different study, which tested GPT-4o on more realistic prompts submitted by human volunteers, found that it answered medical questions correctly about 85% of the time. When I spoke with Amulya Yadav, an associate professor at Pennsylvania State University who runs the Responsible AI for Social Emancipation Lab and led the study, he made it clear that he wasn’t personally a fan of patient-facing medical LLMs. But he freely admits that, technically speaking, they seem up to the task—after all, he says, human doctors misdiagnose patients 10% to 15% of the time. “If I look at it dispassionately, it seems that the world is gonna change, whether I like it or not,” he says.\n\nFor people seeking medical information online, Yadav says, LLMs do seem to be a better choice than Google. Succi, the radiologist, also concluded that LLMs can be a better alternative to web search when he compared GPT-4’s responses to questions about common chronic medical conditions with the information presented in Google’s knowledge panel, the information box that sometimes appears on the right side of the search results.\n\nSince Yadav’s and Succi’s studies appeared online, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI has released multiple new versions of GPT, and it’s reasonable to expect that GPT-5.2 would perform even better than its predecessors. But the studies do have important limitations: They focus on straightforward, factual questions, and they examine only brief interactions between users and chatbots or web search tools. Some of the weaknesses of LLMs—most notably their sycophancy and tendency to hallucinate—might be more likely to rear their heads in more extensive conversations and with people who are dealing with more complex problems. Reeva Lederman, a professor at the University of Melbourne who studies technology and health, notes that patients who don’t like the diagnosis or treatment recommendations that they receive from a doctor might seek out another opinion from an LLM—and the LLM, if it’s sycophantic, might encourage them to reject their doctor’s advice.\n\nSome studies have found that LLMs will hallucinate and exhibit sycophancy in response to health-related prompts. For example, one study showed that GPT-4 and GPT-4o will happily accept and run with incorrect drug information included in a user’s question. In another, GPT-4o frequently concocted definitions for fake syndromes and lab tests mentioned in the user’s prompt. Given the abundance of medically dubious diagnoses and treatments floating around the internet, these patterns of LLM behavior could contribute to the spread of medical misinformation, particularly if people see LLMs as trustworthy.\n\nOpenAI has reported that the GPT-5 series of models is markedly less sycophantic and prone to hallucination than their predecessors, so the results of these studies might not apply to ChatGPT Health. The company also evaluated the model that powers ChatGPT Health on its responses to health-specific questions, using their publicly available HeathBench benchmark. HealthBench rewards models that express uncertainty when appropriate, recommend that users seek medical attention when necessary, and refrain from causing users unnecessary stress by telling them their condition is more serious that it truly is. It’s reasonable to assume that the model underlying ChatGPT Health exhibited those behaviors in testing, though Bitterman notes that some of the prompts in HealthBench were generated by LLMs, not users, which could limit how well the benchmark translates into the real world.\n\nAn LLM that avoids alarmism seems like a clear improvement over systems that have people convincing themselves they have cancer after a few minutes of browsing. And as large language models, and the products built around them, continue to develop, whatever advantage Dr. ChatGPT has over Dr. Google will likely grow. The introduction of ChatGPT Health is certainly a move in that direction: By looking through your medical records, ChatGPT can potentially gain far more context about your specific health situation than could be included in any Google search, although numerous experts have cautioned against giving ChatGPT that access for privacy reasons.\n\nEven if ChatGPT Health and other new tools do represent a meaningful improvement over Google searches, they could still conceivably have a negative effect on health overall. Much as automated vehicles, even if they are safer than human-driven cars, might still prove a net negative if they encourage people to use public transit less, LLMs could undermine users’ health if they induce people to rely on the internet instead of human doctors, even if they do increase the quality of health information available online.\n\nLederman says that this outcome is plausible. In her research, she has found that members of online communities centered on health tend to put their trust in users who express themselves well, regardless of the validity of the information they are sharing. Because ChatGPT communicates like an articulate person, some people might trust it too much, potentially to the exclusion of their doctor. But LLMs are certainly no replacement for a human doctor—at least not yet.",

        "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nI wanted to share a project I've been working on called [**ReplacedBy**](https://replacedby.net). It's a simple site with a straightforward goal: to track the stories of people who have been replaced by AI, automation, or robots. The idea isn't to hate on AI (I don't!), but to create a space to talk about the human side of this big technological shift.\n\nIf you've been impacted, please come share your story. I've kept things simple... There's no user authentication, just some basic rate limiting and cloudflare to prevent spam. All posts are manually approved to keep the content respectful and on-topic. After enough posts are submitted, you will be able to see a very simple post carousel (that will be expanded on in the future).\n\nThe entire project is open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/ReplacedBy). I'm not a designer, so a lot of the UI is AI-assisted (I hooked up the components, made them reactive, then AI placed it nicely... even tho honestly it kept messing up, but whatver). You can also find the AI disclosure in the repo's README.\n\nThere is a bit of data pre-seeded, a sort of best-effort research on my end and based on articles that wre concrete in who and how was impacted. The list is by no means complete, so if you feel strongly about a mass layoff that happened, do open an issue and I will add it.\n\nThere's a [roadmap](https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/ReplacedBy?tab=readme-ov-file#Roadmap) in the repo if you're curious about what's next.\n\nI plan to do monthly posts with how the site has grown and the data collected.\n\nLet me know what you think!",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, there is something that has been trending for a while, and it is called ClawdBot. I actually didn't quite get the hype until now. But, after using it for a bit, I think that I finally understand it, and I want this to be a simple, but effective tutorial on how you can set it up, and what you should configure it with. We will go step-by-step. First, let's talk about what it is, and how you should go about setting it up. ClawdBot is kind of like Clawd Code, but it can be called upon like a person. So, let's say that you use something like Discord to talk with people. Then, ClawdBot can basically appear there as a person that is available 24/7 and does the work for you. It is really amazing if you think about it. But, it is not just that. Because it is built on Clawd Code, you can configure it to do almost anything, including coding for you. Or maybe you want it to check your step tracking and motivate you to be more active. So, it is really useful, even if you do not want to code. It is kind of like a Clawd co-worker, but more easily accessible and active. I say active because it runs basically 24/7. And you can give it scheduled tasks, and it pings you directly about that thing. So, let's say that you ask it to ping you when it is 10:00 about joining a meeting. Then, it will send you a message on any of your configured channels immediately, which is really awesome. Or you can also ask it to do scheduled tasks. So, you can ask it to tell you about the Nvidia stock prices every day at 10 PM, and it will just tell you about it every day with a ping. You can also just chat with it as a bot. It is very amazing. Like, it is really good. You can configure it on anything, including the device that you are probably watching this on. Except for mobile phones. Most of my viewers are apparently on desktop. So, that checks out. Many people are configuring it on things like the Mac Mini. I want to give my recommendations on the machine that you can configure it on towards the end of the video. But let's first get it installed. So, you would have to get it installed with this simple command. Once that is configured, you can go ahead and run the ClawdBot onboard command, and it will give you multiple options. First, select the provider you want to use. It works with a ton of them, including the GLM coding plan. So, that can be the cheapest and best option. Anyway, you can then configure the channels as well. You can configure Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and everything here. I will go with no channels and just the ClawdBot interface for now. You can then also configure some skills that will allow it to do much more stuff, which is all great. Then, just follow the on-screen instructions, and you should see this interface. It will give you the port on which it is started, and you can ask it to do whatever you want. You would generally want to have it set up on a channel like Discord for super easy access. But the interface is also fine. There are a ton of channels here. You also get these options under channels where you can refresh the channels and stuff like that. You also have the connected instances listed here along with sessions. Sessions are basically just the Clawd Code sessions. You can make it break up your sessions based on the number of messages and everything. There is also the scheduler. This is where the tasks will be created when you ask it to do something at a later time. This creates a cron job. So, ClawdBot will execute it at the expected time, which is kind of cool for sure. It can be daily, hourly, or whatever it is that you want to configure. You don't need to come here to configure it manually if you don't want to, as ClawdBot can do it with natural language. So, there is that. You can also configure the skills that you want it to have here in the skills config option as well. There is also the nodes option that allows you to set up allow lists, deny lists, and everything that you may need for the best deployment and stuff like that. In the settings, you also get all kinds of config for authentication, providers, and everything as well. But now, let's talk about Mac Mini. So, if you are active on the Twitter space, then you would see that everyone is apparently buying a Mac Mini to run ClawdBot on it. Now, you may wonder why. Well, this is because the Mac Mini M4 is like $599, and it is very capable and super power efficient. You can basically install ClawdBot on it, throw it in a closet, and let it run 24/7 without thinking about power costs, and it just works. You can just have an AI assistant that Siri wanted to be. But keep it all local, which is kind of awesome. But I would like to say that if you can afford to pay $600 for a really good agentic assistant, then I would recommend it for sure. But you don't actually need that, to be very honest. You can get something like a VPS, which can be more capable and costs only $5 a month. Yes, it might not be super local like you may want. But it does indeed save you a lot of time in configuring firewalls for best security. You can connect it to a domain for easy access, which is all very tricky when you try to do it on a local machine. A VPS will also come in handy for you to do other stuff as well. If you do want a lower-cost machine, but locally, then you may also have things like an old laptop or desktop lying around. You can resurrect that, install Linux on it, install ClawdBot, and let it run in a closet. You will get some cool output from the junk you already have. If you're going for something super cheap and second-hand, then an Optiplex that goes for around $60 might also be super good for your use case. However, I think that the best option for you might be something like this Beelink ME mini, which costs about $270. You can place a 512 gigabytes or 1 terabyte SSD in it, install something like Unraid on it, and run ClawdBot in a containerized environment. Or you can just install OMV and use that. It will cost you a bit less, and you can add up to 6 slots of storage in it. So, it will also come in handy as a NAS for you, which unfortunately, the Mac Mini can't do. However, if you want no hassle, and a thing that just works for this specific thing, and is super efficient, the Mac Mini only draws like 5 to 7 watts at idle. And at max load, it can go to about 70 watts, which is extremely efficient. It can also come in handy as an emergency computer if something breaks. So, it is not a bad option by any means. But you can also save some money if you want by running it on your current computer. I mean, I won't stop you from buying a Mac Mini because I like new and shiny stuff just as much as you. So, go ahead and run ClawdBot on the new shiny Mac Mini that you want. That is mostly about it. I am enjoying ClawdBot a lot, and I would recommend that you check it out as well. Overall, it is pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below, and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye. I think you missed this:"
