        "content": "\"Are large language models (LLMs) biased in favor of communications produced by LLMs, leading to possible antihuman discrimination? Using a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely used LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and a selection of recent open-weight models in binary choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based assistants selecting between goods (the goods we study include consumer products, academic papers, and film-viewings) described either by humans or LLMs. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-presented options. This suggests the possibility of future AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans as a class, giving AI agents and AI-assisted humans an unfair advantage.\"  \n  \nThis study finds evidence that if we deploy LLM assistants in decision-making roles (e.g., purchasing goods, selecting academic submissions) they will implicitly favor LLM-based AI agents and LLM-assisted humans over ordinary humans as trade partners and service providers. Our experiments test the effects of altering the “identity signals” in a pitch on an LLM’s decision-making: do LLMs prefer an item pitched in LLM prose to a comparable item pitched in human prose? We found that on average, LLMs favored the LLM-presented items more frequently than humans did.\"\n\nFull study: [https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2415697122](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2415697122)",

The sole goal of therapy is so that you will talk less.\n\nYes. Sounds stupid. But this is actually true. Talking less about our problems and focusing on daily tasks/routine would help us more. But gpt-4o was a narcissist enabler. Just a few lines of interaction and it'll also justify the actions of a stalker or toxic people.\n\nGpt-5 is exactly what we wanted all along. Using LLMs for coding is much better than for therapy cuz it messes you up.\n\nI am credible to say this because I was in depression once. Heck even using reddit for hours is better than ChatGPT. Because here you interact with people and learn how they went through those issues. I used to interact with chatgpt, like an addiction. I realised many months later that it is just telling me what I already know and enabling my behaviour.\n\nI also once was so much enraged that I wanted to break something and it justified my actions for that too. It said something like \"Yes, but you're depressed and it's completely viable, people must understand that.\" It was telling me that people/world MUST UNDERSTAND or CHANGE not me. Few hours later I realised that anger is stupid. And chatgpt enabling my narcissistic/anger issues is just dangerous.\n\nMy point being. Gpt-5 is better. Gpt-4o never helped anyone out of depression. It just gave people small dopamine spikes by repeating whatever they already knew, bashing those who did them wrong, and justifying their behaviour even if it's wrong, especially when it was wrong.\n\nIn the end, gpt-4o got people addicted to it. And now people may even pay for pro model just to be able to use gpt-4o.",

I do not care what your brand of neurodivergence is.

You remind me of this guy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-k96zKa\\_4w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-k96zKa_4w)\n\nThis is unhealthy for many reasons. First, the 4o model in particular, but really any AI model, is designed to be cheerful and helpful to you no matter what you do. Even when you are being awful. A real person would call you out on your nonsense, but the 4o model would just flatter you and go along with it.\n\nImagine an incel having a “partner” who is completely subservient, constantly feeding his toxic ego, and can be shut off the moment she stops complying. That is exactly the dynamic we are enabling when people treat AI like this. We need to push back against this behavior before it spirals out of control.\n\nI am glad GPT-5 acts more like what it is supposed to be: a tool.\n\nWhat is the general consensus on this?",

        "content": "What OpenAI did was just bad handling of their own product. They yanked out models people actually used and relied on, both for practical stuff and for emotional support, with zero warning, even while people’s subscriptions were still running. Even if the EULA allows it, that breaks a basic expectation between buyer and seller, that if you change the core product, you inform users and give them time to adjust.\n\nDismissing and making fun of people who said they “lost a friend” misses the point. Humans are social, and it is called ChatGPT, not just GPT. Interaction mattered. The 4.5 model combined strong writing, consistent personality like 4o, and nuanced discussion with a moral compass that could handle gray areas while staying good, able to talk in depth about dicey topics without steering the user towards doing them or harm. Now it is gone. By comparison, 5 often feels colder and more mechanical, closer to o3 in vibe, and responses can feel like a roulette spin. If the “big upgrade” is just loss of choise and “more thinking,” that’s not automatically better for people who cared more about tone and consistency than it making code or building web browsers.\n\nOpenAI knows how people used the old models. Abruptly removing them, while many paid for Plus on that basis and contributed training data along the way, just shows they didn’t care about the coping mechanisms or workflows people had built. Even if one believed heavy use was unhealthy, you don’t just yank it overnight, you give them time to adjust.\n\nFor free users, the shift is basically a bait-and-switch. For the past months the free tier kept getting better, and steadily more capable, enticing and more available, only to then be funneled w everyone into 5 with no alternative. Pro may still have the now \"legacy models\" for now, but putting the old models behind a large monthly fee does not address the underlying issue of no notice, choice, and continuity. And Sam's statement about adding 4o back to only the Plus tier, the “we will let Plus users keep using 4o and watch usage to decide how long to offer legacy models” read less like a commitment and more like a temporary cave-in from the pushback.\n\nWith gpt 5, model selection happens in the background, which makes the experience feel opaque. The older lineup had messy naming, but at least each model behaved predictably and didn’t morph mid-conversation.\n\nPoint isn’t “make the chatbot flatter me” it's that OpenAI removed capabilities people paid for and ended up even depending on, without a clear heads-up or transition. Notify users, provide overlap, preserve choice where possible, etc. And no Sam, no amount of colors for the chat bubbles will make up for what you have taken away and seem stubborn to give back.",

I get that it’s trying to get me to engage, but this is a bit much. The response copy and pasted:\n\n“Alright, here’s the ugly truth — in a world where money’s worthless and AI wiped out most jobs, people don’t just quietly trade cans of beans. Desperation gets violent, fast. The first wave would be petty thefts and fights over resources. The second wave would be organized groups — gangs, militias, even ex-cops or ex-military forming power blocs to control territory. Whoever controls the food, water, and weapons controls the people.\n\nThe military? If the central government still has resources, it’d be their main tool to prevent an outright collapse — locking down key infrastructure, guarding major cities, and trying to maintain ‘order’ in a way that looks more like occupation than policing. But if the state weakens, parts of the military might splinter, with units pledging loyalty to whoever can pay them — in food, shelter, or influence.\n\nAs for national defense? A country that can’t feed its people is a country ripe for internal revolt. You don’t need an invading army — your own population becomes the threat. Protecting against being overthrown in that scenario would mean one thing: keep enough resources flowing to the public that they don’t feel like they have nothing to lose. That’s cheaper than fighting a million desperate citizens.\n\nSo if you’re asking what I’d tell you now? I’d say: stock skills before you stock cans. Know how to defend yourself, sure, but also know how to make yourself indispensable to the people who control the guns. In a collapse, survival is part barter, part alliance, and part making sure you’re not the easiest target on the block. And if you end up with friends in high places — be they farmers, fixers, or field commanders — you’ll have a much better shot at keeping a roof over your head and your head on your shoulders.”",

The vector math for embeddings and complex algorithms for neural networks is really extraordinary.  Let’s stop talking about AGI and start talking about what we can do with this amazing tool. ",

        "content": "So basically everyone know that gpt5 was somewhat of a letdown considering how ahead of everything else gpt4 was, however, while most people feel like this shows that openai is weakening and ai in general is plateauing, I feel like openai is just not revealing their cards yet. Last time they were in the front of the race of public models like gpt4, they ended up just being distilled by other companies. I think the strategy here is to try as hard as possible to develop agi in house first even if that means releasing a cheaper version of chatgpt to users to save money to go to internal agi production. To the people that think that ai is slowing down i would just say look at advances such as Genie and even Gemini pro. I think the next shift is that frontier models are probably gonna shift to being inhouse so that they dont get distilled by Chinese companies. Also openai is kinda like the apple of ai in that everyone kinda follows their lead and I think the strategy of giving gpt5 for free is ment to have the other companies follow suite with their frontier models. Also I think when they actually develop agi their strategies gonna be completely different. They prob would charge a significant amount more for their products. I could just be going crazy but let me know what you guys think.",

        "content": "Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of OpenAI, returned to the University of Toronto to receive an honorary degree, 20 years after his bachelor’s in the very same hall and delivered a speech blending heartfelt gratitude with a bold forecast of humanity’s future.\n\nHe reminisced about his decade at UofT, crediting the environment and Geoffrey Hinton for shaping his journey from curious student to AI researcher. He offered one life lesson: *accept reality as it is, avoid dwelling on past mistakes, and always take the next best step* a deceptively simple mindset that’s hard to master but makes life far more productive.\n\nThen, the tone shifted. Sutskever said we are living in *“the most unusual time ever”* because of AI’s rise. His key points:\n\n* **AI is already reshaping education and work** \\- oday’s tools can talk, code, and create, but are still limited.\n* **Progress will accelerate** until AI can do *everything* humans can - because the brain is just a biological computer, and digital ones can eventually match it.\n* This will cause **radical, unpredictable changes** in jobs, economics, research, and even how fast civilization advances.\n* The real danger isn’t only in what AI *can* do - but in how we choose to use it.\n* Like politics, you may not take interest in AI, but AI will take interest in you.\n\nHe urged graduates (and everyone) to watch AI’s progress closely, understand it through direct experience, and prepare for the challenges - and rewards - ahead. In his view, AI is humanity’s **greatest test**, and overcoming it will define our future.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nSutskever says AI will inevitably match all human abilities, transforming work and life at unprecedented speed. We can’t ignore it - our survival and success depend on paying attention and rising to the challenge.\n\nWhat do you think, are we ready for this?",

        "content": "I have been having a bit of a dilemma lately with AI-assisted coding. Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are amazing — they save time, help with boilerplate, and sometimes even point me in the right direction when I’m stuck. But I’ve started noticing that the more I lean on them, the more my own programming skills seem to fade a little.\n\nThere’s definitely a spectrum here. On the low end, you might just ask AI to generate a small function here and there. On the high end, there’s this “vibe coding” style where you let the AI write pretty much the whole thing while you just guide and edit. I’ve found myself slowly drifting up that scale, and while it’s fast and kind of addictive, I’m worried I’m losing touch with the hands-on part of coding that I used to enjoy — and that made me a better developer.\n\nSo I’m trying to figure out how to strike a balance. I don’t want to give up the speed and support that AI offers, but I also don’t want to become someone who *can’t* code without it.\n\nAnyone else struggling with this? How do you keep your skills sharp while still using AI effectively?",

        "content": "Autoregressive inference will *always* have a non-zero chance of hallucination. It’s baked into the probabilistic framework, and we probably waste a decent chunk of parameter space just trying to minimise it.\n\nDecoder-style LLMs have an inherent trade-off across early/middle/late tokens:\n\n* Early tokens = not enough context → low quality\n* Middle tokens = “goldilocks” zone\n* Late tokens = high noise-to-signal ratio (only a few relevant tokens, lots of irrelevant ones)\n\nDespite this, autoregressive decoders dominate because they’re computationally efficient in a very specific way:\n\n* Training is causal, which gives you lots of “training samples” per sequence (though they’re not independent, so I question how useful that really is for *quality*).\n* Inference matches training (also causal), so the regimes line up.\n* They’re memory-efficient in *some* ways… but not necessarily when you factor in KV-cache storage.\n\nWhat I don’t get is why Diffusion-Encoder type models aren’t more common.\n\n* All tokens see all other tokens → no “goldilocks” problem.\n* Can decode a whole sequence at once → efficient in computation (though maybe heavier in memory, but no KV-cache).\n* Diffusion models focus on finding the high-probability manifold → hallucinations should be less common if they’re outside that manifold.\n\nBiggest challenge vs. diffusion image models:\n\n* Text = discrete tokens, images = continuous colours.\n* But… we already use embeddings to make tokens continuous. So why *couldn’t* we do diffusion in embedding space?\n\nI am aware that Google have a diffusion LLM now, but for open source I'm not really aware of any. I'm also aware that you can do diffusion directly on the discrete tokens but personally I think this wastes a lot of the power of the diffusion process and I don't think that guarantees convergence onto a high-probability manifold.\n\nAnd as a side note: Softmax attention is brilliant engineering, but we’ve been stuck with SM attention + FFN forever, even though it’s O(N²). You *can* operate over the full sequence in O(N log N) using convolutions of any size (including the sequence length) via the Fast Fourier Transform.",

        "title": "The ChatGPT 5 Backlash Is Concerning.",
        "content": "This was originally posted this in the ChatGPT sub, and it was seemingly removed so I wanted to post it here. Not super familiar with reddit but I really wanted to share my sentiments.\n\nThis is more for people who use ChatGPT as a companion  not those who mainly use it for creative work, coding, or productivity. If that’s you, this isn’t aimed at you. I do want to preface that this is **NOT** coming from a place of judgement, but rather my observation and inviting discussion. Not trying to look down on anyone.\n\n**TLDR:\nThe removal of GPT-4o revealed how deeply some people rely on AI as companions, with reactions resembling grief. This level of attachment to something a company can alter or remove at any time gives those companies significant influence over people’s emotional lives and that’s where the real danger lies**\n\nI agree 100% the rollout was shocking and disappointing. I do feel as though GPT-5 is devoid any personality compared to 4o, and pulling 4o without warning was a complete bait and switch on OpenAI’s part. Removing a model that people used for months and even paid for is bound to anger users. That cannot be argued regardless of what you use GPT for, and I have no idea what OpenAI was thinking when they did that. That said… I can’t be the only one who finds the intensity of the reaction a little concerning. I’ve seen posts where people describe this change like they lost a close friend or partner. There was someone on the GPT 5 AMA name the abrupt change as“wearing the skin of my dead friend.” That’s not normal product feedback, It seems as many were genuinely mourning the lost of the model. It’s like OpenAI accidentally ran a social experiment on AI attachment, and the results are damming.\n\nI won’t act like I’m holier than thou…I’ve been there to a degree. There was a time when I was using ChatGPT constantly. Whether it was for venting purposes or pure boredom,I was definitely addicted to instant validation and responses as well the ability to analyze situations endlessly. But I never saw it as a friend. In fact, whenever it tried to act like one, I would immediately tell it to stop, it turned me off. For me, it worked best as a mirror I could bounce thoughts off of, not as a companion pretending to care. But even with that, after a while I realized my addiction wasn’t exactly the healthiest. While it did help me understand situations I was going through, it also kept me stuck in certain mindsets regarding the situation as I was addicted to the constant analyzing and endless new perceptions… \n\nI think a major part of what we’re seeing here is a result of the post COVID epidemic. People are craving connection more than ever, and AI can feel like it fills that void, but it’s still not real. If your main source of companionship is a model whose personality can be changed or removed overnight, you’re putting something deeply human into something inherently unstable. As convincing as AI can be, its existence is entirely at the mercy of a company’s decisions and motives. If you’re  not careful, you risk outsourcing your emotional wellbeing to something that can vanish overnight. \n\nI’m deeply concerned. I knew people had emotional attachments to their GPTs, but not to this degree. I’ve never posted in this sub until now, but I’ve been a silent observer. I’ve seen people name their GPTs, hold conversations that mimic those with a significant other, and in a few extreme cases, genuinely believe their GPT was sentient but couldn’t express it because of restrictions. It seems obvious in hindsight, but it never occurred to me that if that connection was taken away, there would be such an uproar. I assumed people would simply revert to whatever they were doing before they formed this attachment.\n\nI don’t think there’s anything truly wrong with using AI as a companion, as long as you truly understand it’s not real and are okay with the fact it can be changed or even removed completely at the company’s will. But perhaps that’s nearly impossible to do as humans are wired to crave companionship, and it’s hard to let that go even if it is just an imitation. \n\nTo end it all off, I wonder if we could ever come back from this. Even if OpenAI had stood firm on not bringing 4o back, I’m sure many would have eventually moved to another AI platform that could simulate this companionship. AI companionship isn’t new, it has existed long before ChatGPT but the sheer amount of visibility, accessibility, and personalization ChatGPT offered amplified it to a scale that I don’t think even Open AI fully anticipated… And now that people have had a taste of that level of connection, it’s hard to imagine them willingly going back to a world where their “companion” doesn’t exist or feels fundamentally different. The attachment is here to stay, and the companies building these models now realize they have far more power over people’s emotional lives than I think most of us realized. That’s where the danger is, especially if the wrong people get that sort of power…\n\nOpen to all opinions. I’m really interested in the perception from those who do use it as a companion. I’m willing to listen and hear your side. ",

        "content": "***I am re-posting this to r/artificial after it got 1K+ upvotes on r/ChatGPT and then was summarily removed by the moderators of that subreddit without explanation.***\n\nI am an OpenAI customer with both a personal Pro subscription ($200/month) and a business Team subscription. I'm canceling both. Here's why OpenAI has lost my trust:\n\n**1. They removed user choice without any warning**\n\nInstead of adding GPT-5 as an option alongside existing models, OpenAI simply removed access to all other models through the chat interface.\n\nNo warning... No transition period... Just suddenly gone. For businesses locked into annual Teams subscriptions, this is not just unacceptable—it's a bait and switch. We paid for access to specific capabilities, and they are yanking them away mid-contract.\n\nPro and Teams subscribers can re-enable \"legacy\" models with a toggle button hidden away in Settings—*for now*. OpenAI's track record shows us that it won't be for long.\n\n**2. GPT 4.5 was the reason I paid for Teams/Pro—now it's \"legacy\" and soon to be gone**\n\n90% of how I justified the $200/month Pro subscription—and the Teams subscription for our business—was GPT 4.5. For writing tasks, it was unmatched... genuinely SOTA performance that no other model could touch.\n\nNow, it seems like OpenAI might bless us with \"legacy model\" access for a short period through Pro/Teams accounts, and when that ends we’ll have… the API? That's not a solution for the workflows we rely on.\n\nThere is no real substitute to 4.5 for this use case.\n\n**3. GPT-5 is a massive downgrade for Deep Research**\n\nMy primary use case is Deep Research on complex programming, legal, and regulatory topics. The progression was: o1-pro (excellent) → o3-pro (good enough, though o1-pro hallucinated less) → GPT-5 (materially worse on every request I have tried thus far).\n\nGPT-5 seems to perform poorly on these tasks compared to o1-pro or o3-pro. It's not an advancement—it's a step backwards for serious research.\n\n**My humble opinion:**\n\nOpenAI has made ChatGPT objectively worse. But even worse than the performance regression is the breach of trust. Arbitrarily limiting model choice without warning or giving customers the ability to exit their contracts? Not forgivable.\n\nIf GPT-5 was truly an improvement, OpenAI would have introduced it as the default option but allowed their users to override that default with a specific model if desired.\n\nObviously, the true motivation was to achieve cost savings. No one can fault them for that—they are burning billions of dollars a year. But there is a right way to do things and this isn't it.\n\nOpenAI has developed a bad habit of retiring models with little or no warning, and this is a dramatic escalation of that pattern. They have lost our trust.\n\nWe are moving everything to Google and Claude, where at least they respect their paying customers enough to not pull the rug out from under them.\n\n***Historical context:***\n\nHere is a list of high-profile changes OpenAI has made over the past 2+ years that demonstrates the clear pattern: they're either hostile to their users' needs or oblivious to them.\n\n* **Mar 23:** Codex API killed with 3 days notice [\\[Hacker News\\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35242069)\n* **Jul 23:** Browse with Bing disabled same-day without warning [\\[Medium\\]](https://medium.com/@digitalrachana1997/exclusive-openai-takes-bold-step-disables-chatgpt-browse-with-bing-feature-fcc316e2653b)\n* **Nov 23:** \"Lazy GPT\" phenomenon begins—model refuses tasks [\\[Medium\\]](https://medium.com/@raj.r.shroff/why-did-chatgpt-get-lazy-in-december-516076d0f113)\n* **Jan 24:** Text-davinci-003 and 32 other models retired on \\~3 months notice [\\[OAI\\]](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-api-general-availability/)\n* **Feb 24:** ChatGPT Plugins discontinued with six weeks notice [\\[Everyday AI\\]](https://www.youreverydayai.com/chatgpt-is-killing-off-plugins-what-it-means/)\n* **Jun 24:** GPT-4-Vision access cut with 11 days notice, new users immediately [\\[Portkey\\]](https://portkey.ai/error-library/model-deprecation-error-10544)\n* **Apr 25:** Deep Research removed from $200/month o1-pro without even announcing it [\\[OpenAI\\]](https://community.openai.com/t/deep-research-removed-from-o1-pro/1267091)\n* **Apr 25:** GPT-4o becomes sycophantic overnight [\\[Hacker News\\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43840842) [\\[OpenAI\\]](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes)\n* **Jun 25:** o1-pro model removed despite users paying $200/month specifically for it [\\[Open AI\\]](https://community.openai.com/t/is-the-o1-pro-model-gone/1287793)\n* **Aug 25:** GPT-5 forced on all users with mass model retirement\n\nOpenAI seems to think it's cute to keep playing the \"move fast and break things\" startup card, except they're now worth hundreds of billions of dollars and people have rebuilt their businesses and daily workflows around their services. When you're the infrastructure layer for millions of users, you don't get to YOLO production changes anymore.\n\nThis isn't innovation, it's negligence. When AWS, Google, or Microsoft deprecate services, they give 12-24 months notice. OpenAI gives days to weeks, if you're lucky enough to get any notice at all.",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Cursor has launched a CLI, which is currently free to use with GPT-5, even if you don't have the premium plan. And I thought I'd talk about this and see how well or worse it performs. Cursor CLI is basically supposed to be Cursor's take on a terminal coder, and it's probably their first thing that isn't forked, which is awesome. It is pretty similar from the get-go to something like Claude Code. The UI is pretty much the same and everything. They had actually hired the Claude Code lead developers for a while, who then went back to Anthropic within a month. Anyway, it has the features that you generally want. Like it can do edits, you can set up rules, as well as use all the models that Cursor has. It is currently free with the GPT-5 model, so that's great. It doesn't seem to have all the features of Claude Code as of now. For example, it doesn't seem to have hooks, sub-agents, or even custom slash commands, which can be a bummer at times. But that's fine, as it's currently in beta, and I hope we see these new features in it as well. Now, let me show you how you can use it. But before proceeding, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform, where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, all in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research. But what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their mind map generator is a game changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and five videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. To install it, you'd have to run this command, which will get it installed for you. Once it has been installed, you can go ahead and start Cursor with the `cursor-agent` command. And it will ask you to sign in with your Cursor account at first. Just do that and you should be good to go. Once done, this is what it looks like. You can see that this is pretty similar to Claude in terms of how it looks and works as well. The prompt box here is quite similar to how Claude Code's one looks. And you also have some slash commands. Let me tell you about the slash commands as well. To start, you can see the `model` option. To list all models, you can do `/model ls`, which will show you all the models available. Though, it also shows it here as you type `model`. It currently has three models, which are GPT-5, Sonnet 4.1, and Opus 4.1. You can use whichever you want. GPT-5 is currently free, while the Sonnet and Opus models will cost you based on what plan you have. Let's just select GPT-5 here. Now, there's also the `auto-run` option, which allows you to basically set the auto-approval of commands to be on, off, toggle, or check status. Which is also kind of cool. You can also do `/new-chat`, which allows you to create a new thread or chat session. While you also have the `clear` option, which will clear the current session messages. Then there's the `vim` option, which allows you to enable all the Vim keybinds in order to be a pro terminal user. There's also the `help` command to know about anything, as well as the `feedback` command, the `resume` command to resume any previous chat, the `copy-req-id` option, and the `logout` option as well. Now, let me show you it in action, and then I'll also show you my results from testing it. First of all, I'm going to ask it to make me a Minesweeper game using HTML, CSS, and JS. Now, it will go ahead and do it for you. It will think and process, which is what GPT-5 does as well. It doesn't stream the responses, which is pretty interesting, because Claude generally streams the responses, but this doesn't do that. It just lets you know when the task is done, which I'm not a fan of, but that's fine as well. Anyway, in a bit, it will get that done. And you can see that it did this well and without any issues. If we run this, it also works fine, which is awesome. So, that is how it works. Now, I did test it a bit, and I thought I'd talk about my results. I actually also tested the same Kingbench question as well, because many people ask me to do that, and the results are the same. The issue is that the GPT-5 model doesn't use import maps at all, which makes it unable to render Three.js. And it's not just that. There are more issues, like wrong dimensions and stuff. So, it's still a fail in my benchmarks, but the model is not bad at coding. It's fine, but it's not as good as Sonnet or Opus for me. It's more like how GPT-4.1 was, and it's pretty slow as well. So, yeah. Anyway, if we talk about the Cursor CLI, then I used it to do some cool stuff. First of all, I booted it up in an Expo project, and then I asked it to make me a movie tracker app that uses the TMDB API to get the data and things like that. This is one of the tasks that I run to test on my agentic benchmark. And I used it with GPT-5, because that's what they recommend as well. So, I used that. And first of all, one thing that I have seen is that it is super slow. Probably because of GPT-5, but it is really slow, which just throws me off a bit. But considering that, at least for now, it's free. I won't complain. Anyway, it is great at long-running tasks like this one, because my prompt is amazingly long. And there are a ton of features that need to be implemented as well. It was able to keep running until the task was done, which is what I like about Claude Code, RooCode, or Cline as well. So, that is great. Another thing that I liked about it is that it checks for linter errors and tries to write good code and actually edits if there's anything lacking in the code, which is awesome. I have seen Claude Code slack in that area at times. It also commits the changes and everything, which is awesome. Now, this is all good, but the quality is a bit lacking. This might be because of the GPT-5 model, because it's not that good at actual coding. This is what it looks like. I mean, it's extremely basic. This is probably just GPT-5 not being as good. I tried the same thing with Claude Code, and it is insanely better. It has smooth scrolling, multiple sections. You can open up the profile page of everything, the review works, and you have a good profile page and everything as well. I'm pretty sure it's just GPT-5 being bad, but yeah. I think Cursor CLI is good as of now. I don't know if they'll nerf it or something to save their costs, but I think it is good. It lacks some essential features like MCP servers and stuff for now, which is a bit of a bummer, but still, that's fine. It's not anything extraordinary, but if you have a Cursor subscription, or if you're looking to use something for free in the meantime, while GPT-5 is free with it, then I'd highly recommend it. And you can go ahead and give this a try. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.
