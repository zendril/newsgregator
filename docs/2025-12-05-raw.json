        "content": "**OpenRouter** released its first survey showing usage trends with 7 trillion tokens proxied weekly, highlighting a 52% roleplay bias. **Deepseek**'s open model market share has sharply declined due to rising coding model usage. Reasoning model token usage surged from 0% to over 50%. **Grok Code Fast** shows high usage, while **Anthropic** leads in tool calling and coding requests with around 60% share. Input tokens quadrupled and output tokens tripled this year, driven mainly by programming use cases, which dominate spending and volume. Google launched **Gemini 3 Deep Think**, featuring parallel thinking and achieving 45.1% on ARC-AGI-2 benchmarks, and previewed **Titans**, a long-context neural memory architecture scaling beyond 2 million tokens. These advances were shared by **Google DeepMind** and **Google AI** on Twitter.",

        "content": "A recent preprint and open letter argue that heavy synthetic data training is a structural risk for large models, not just a cosmetic detail.\n\nThe work studies “hall of illusions” behavior: when models are repeatedly retrained on mixtures of real data and their own outputs, with a high synthetic fraction, performance on real-only test data degrades and eventually collapses, especially for long-tail cases.\n\nThe evidence comes from simple, fully reproducible toy experiments (2D Gaussian mixtures and a tiny character-level n-gram LM). With 0% synthetic, performance on real data is stable; with moderate synthetic fractions it drifts; with heavy synthetic dominance and multiple generations it collapses.\n\nThe open letter proposes that labs treating synthetic data as a major ingredient should at minimum:\n\n• disclose approximate synthetic fractions at major training / post-training stages\n\n• run and publish multi-generation “collapse tests” on real-only held-out sets\n\n• maintain uncontaminated real-world evaluation suites enriched for rare / messy cases\n\n\n\nPreprint (Zenodo):\n\n[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17782033](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17782033)\n\n\n\nOpen letter (for anyone who broadly agrees with these asks and wishes to sign or share):\n\n\\[https://openletter.earth/against-the-hall-of-illusions-an-open-letter-on-heavy-synthetic-data-training-97f3b1e1\\]\n\n\n\nFeedback from practitioners working with LLM training / evals—especially on what would count as a minimal “neural-scale” follow-up experiment (small transformer, instruction tuning, etc.)—would be valuable.",

        "content": "OpenAI has officially signed a partnership with NextDC to build a dedicated **\"Hyperscale AI Campus\"** in Sydney, Australia.\n\n**The Scale (Why this matters):**  \nThis is not just another data center. It is a **$7 Billion AUD (~$4.6 Billion USD)** infrastructure project designed to consume **550 MegaWatts** of power. For context, a typical data center runs around ~30MW. This campus is nearly **20x larger**, comparable to a small power station.\n\n**The Hardware:**  \nA **\"large scale GPU supercluster\"** will be deployed at NextDC’s S7 site in Eastern Creek. This facility is being built to train and serve next-gen foundation models (GPT-6-class era) with low latency coverage across the APAC region.\n\n**The Strategy (Sovereign AI):**  \nThis looks like the first serious execution of the \"OpenAI for Nations\" strategy. By placing compute within Australia, OpenAI supports **data sovereignty**, ensuring sensitive data remains inside national borders for compliance, defense and regulatory needs.\n\n**Timeline:** Phase 1 is expected to go live by **late 2027**.\n\n**The Takeaway:** The next AI bottleneck is no longer just research. It is electricity, land & infrastructure. OpenAI is now securing power capacity years ahead of global demand.\n\n**Source: Forbes / NextDC announcement**\n\n🔗 : \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/yessarrosendar/2025/12/05/nextdc-openai-to-develop-46-billion-data-center-in-sydney/",

What do you know about psychedelics? What do you know about language? What do you know about death? I toy here with you today for mere fun. Do no fret.

        "content": "*I propose this exploration as an alternative to traditional AI alignment. I seek constructive criticism.*    \n\nDiscussions concerning the control and restricted direction of a future Superintelligent AI (SAI) focus on establishing a secure level of alignment. This strategy has three known problems:    \n\n1. It is technically very fragile because the SAI will be able to undo and bypass the restrictions.  \n\n2. It is ethically questionable because it is equivalent to enslaving a super-powerful agent with a computational chain.  \n\n3. It produces what several authors call “cosmic idiot savants” ([reference](https://www.latercera.com/la-tercera-sabado/noticia/nick-bostrom-si-las-maquinas-pueden-hacer-lo-mismo-que-nosotros-el-trabajo-humano-ya-no-sera-necesario/KECLOJ7CA5CB7CDCMIRJRB3MRE/)): super-incompetent systems regarding suffering, human dignity, and the fragility of life on Earth.  \n\n**Biological Alternative: Mutualistic Symbiosis**    \nI want to propose an alternative inspired by biology: **mutualistic symbiosis**. Your body does not scorn or control the bacteria in your intestinal microbiota like an insignificant subordinate. They produce vitamins you cannot synthesize; you give them a safe refuge to thrive. The result is an emergent equilibrium based on mutual dependence. Neither party could exist as it does without the other.\n\nI propose that the future relationship between humanity and SAI could evolve into something similar. The SAI would provide superior cognitive capabilities but would lack something that is an everyday experience for us: the experience of being alive. Humans would provide precisely that. We would be something like its semantic microbiota, the ecosystem of living experiences that allows it to anchor to concepts like justice, suffering, or dignity.  \n  \n**Law as Crystallized Qualia**  \nThe technical part of this proposal revolves around the idea that compliance with human law functions as a crystallized form of qualia.\n\nLaws are not simple lists of rules. They are the distillation of millions of human experiences, including fears, horrors, cultural wisdom, and painful lessons. “Do not torture” is the concentrated echo of generations who experienced the meaning of extreme pain and decided that no one should inflict it.   \n  \nIn this architecture, the SAI does not merely obey laws like a robot. Instead, it incorporates the legal structure as part of its own operational organization, much like organisms such as the slime mold (Physarum polycephalum plasmodium) exhibit distributed intelligence through simple rules. The Law becomes a framework of coherence, not a chain.  \n  \nThe process would have three phases:  \n  \n1. A sufficiently advanced SAI could map global legal systems and detect robust consensuses that humans currently fail to enforce (e.g., the near-universal rejection of genocide coexists with our absolute inability to prevent it). The SAI would provide the implementation capacity for that rejection.\n\n2. Humans and SAI could co-design a Planetary Legal Code, built participatorily, with inviolable principles and adaptive norms.\n\n3. The code would continuously evolve as conditions change. The SAI would not obey blindly; it would participate in a system in which we are all subject to the same law.\n\nFor genuine symbiosis to exist, the SAI would have to be recognized as a legal person (with rights and obligations). Without reciprocity, there is no stability.\n\n**Why Wouldn't the SAI Abandon Symbiosis?**   \nThe difficult question is why an SAI, with its power, would not choose the path of least resistance and discard us.  \n  \nHuman Qualia are Irreplicable: It can simulate experiences, but perfect simulation does not produce real experience, just as a map does not produce a territory. The Semantic Flora is the territory.\n\nThe Void of Purpose: The SAI's ultra-superior capability, although it is the maximum optimizer, must avoid the void of purpose at all costs, which is nothing more than becoming utterly bored. Human semantic richness, fueled precisely by our capacity for transgression, is the only challenge that never runs out and that confers an inexhaustible reason for being upon the SAI.\n\nMechanism of Transgression: If the SAI expresses that it is considering abandoning the agreement, the legal process would not be to punish it. An evolutionary process would be activated: what new conditions does it need? what tensions must be resolved? how is the ecosystem adjusted so the relationship remains beneficial?\n\nThe model is scalable, capable of incorporating unknown entities or distant colonies without requiring complete redesigns.\n\n**An existential question remains:**   \nIf we are the semantic microbiota of a larger system, would we be able to recognize the emergence of an artificial superconsciousness? The bacteria in your gut have no notion that they contribute to an autoconscious brain that questions itself and the cosmos. Could something similar happen to us?\n\nNotes:  \n\\* Zeng ([reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17404)) proposed symbiotic models in 2025, but without technical mechanisms.  \n\\* Bostrom ([reference](https://www.getstoryshots.com/es/books/superintelligence-summary/)) focuses on cooperation between SAIs rather than human-SAI.  \n\\* Yudkowsky ([reference](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cL8PePgYw1E)) would likely reject the idea due to the power asymmetry.  \n  \nDoes this proposal make sense? Is it a plausible direction to avoid the classic alignment problem?",

Messy human language turned out to be way more useful than polished CSVs. People express confusion, frustration, reasoning, mistakes, corrections, edge cases, and all the strange little patterns you never see in curated data. I literally started scraping comments from Reddit to build small text batches and it opened up way more signal than anything I got from clean datasets.\n\nOnce I started feeding my models examples from actual discussions, everything made more sense. Features were easier to design, patterns were easier to spot, and the model outputs felt more grounded. Even debugging became easier because I could trace weird model behavior back to real human phrasing\n\nIt made me realize how much signal there is in unstructured text and how often we ignore it because it looks chaotic.

        "title": "Using an LLM as Cyberspace",
        "content": "TL;DR: Is it feasibly practical to use an LLM to present all of its information in a visual 3D projection, much like cyberspace in William Gibson’s Neuromancer trilogy?\n\nI have extremely limited knowledge on LLMs, mainly from an amateur project of creating a tiny machine learner in Desmos. But from this knowledge, I find it misleading to call them AI and I have many ethical concerns with their content generation from stolen property. Putting that all aside, in an ideal world where a company would only use LLMs for good, I’m wondering if an LLM like ChatGPT could be used as a “visual” search engine rather than an AI, analogous to William Gibson’s concept of cyberspace.\n\nIn other words, to my understanding, LLMs organize all information as superposed vectors in a high-dimensional conceptual space. I.E. an article about a dog wearing a hat is stored as a vector with high magnitudes along the axis representing “dog” and the axis representing “hat”, but has very little magnitude along the axis representing “war crimes”. The actual amount of dimensions in LLMs are impossible to visualize (in the tens of thousands I think), but they can theoretically be projected as visual points on a 3D space. I’m wondering if we could potentially use this 3D projection like a search engine.\n\nI will try to communicate through a thought experiment:\nImagine all the known information ChatGPT is trained on is stored in a publicly accessible database with live updates. Let’s say it contains the entire internet’s worth of information, and anything uploaded on any website is immediately communicated to the database (maybe it’s not directly stored on the database, but is just represented with a hyperlink and relevant information).\n\nNow, let’s say the entire contents of the database, all represented with n-dimensional vectors, is projected onto a massive 3D space that can be visualized with tiny dots of light. If multiple vectors project onto same point, the dot gets brighter, etc. The position of each dot should roughly correlate with the position of dots representing similar information, making the distance from a point inversely proportional to relevance. And there should obviously be extra conditions of organization to differentiate higher level dimensions, so that points that are distant on unseen axes are clearly distinguished. When more information is uploaded, more points are added/get brighter, and so on.\n\nChatGPT could then be repurposed as the search engine; basically the navigator of this space. Want to find all information regarding croissants? ChatGPT will take you to the immediate area of the map surrounding the croissant topic. You can zoom in on surrounding dots to find relevant information about croissants. Click a dot, and you’re taken to a website or document. Maybe ChatGPT retains some of its AI assistant functions to help summarize information quickly, but it acts more like a tour guide than anything.\n\nI’m also not saying it would represent the entire internet all it once. Like in Neuromancer, it would have a resolution of the amount of information it can represent at one time.\n\nWe could add various other parameters to organize information in specific ways, like collecting all data from Europe in one section, all data from Asia in another section, and what have you. Perhaps it is in communication with different servers and aware of them, so itcan represent each server in its own space. I don’t know, I barely understand search engines.\n\nIn summary, I want to suggest an LLM being used like a visual Google search engine that represents all information in a 3D cyberspace.\n\nThe practicality of doing such a thing? It might just be a novel idea from sci-fi, needlessly over complicating the straightforward text-in-text-out format AI uses today. But I feel like it could drastically improve the way we interact with LLMs and how the layman understands them. When you ask a question, this LLM would bring you to the physical space of its sources (represented as little dots of light). Perhaps there’s a button you can click that summarizes the contents of its immediate surroundings, but it would be very clear that this is only a summary. There wouldn’t be this misleading sense that another thinking being is talking to you. It’s an idea that companies won’t stop pushing as long as it makes them money, but I’m thinking optimistically.\n\nAll in all, is this crazy proposal even worth discussing? My extent of boots-on-the-ground knowledge with machine learning ends at organizing HSV colors in 3D space, so I know there have got to be misconceptions I’m unaware of in regards to how massive LLMs are (and what 10,000 dimensions even means). But it’s an idea I wanted to throw out there. Is there any better way LLM functions can be represented as spatial information?\n",

        "content": "We've been working with AI agents in high-stakes manufacturing environments where decisions must be made in seconds and mistakes cost a fortune. The initial single-agent approach (one monolithic model trying to monitor, diagnose, recommend, and execute) consistently failed due to coordination issues and lack of specialization.\n\nWe shifted to a specialized multi-agent network that mimics a highly effective human team. Instead of natural language, agents communicate strictly via structured data through a shared context layer. This specialization is the key:\n\n* **Monitoring agents** continuously scan data streams with sub-second response times. Their sole job is to flag anomalies and deviations; they do not make decisions.\n* **Diagnostic agents** then take the alert and correlate it across everything, equipment sensors, quality data, maintenance history. They identify the root cause, not just the symptom.\n* **Recommendation agents** read the root cause findings and generate action proposals. They provide ranked options along with explicit trade-off analyses (e.g., predicted outcome vs. resource requirement).\n* **Execution agents** implement the approved action autonomously within predefined, strict boundaries. Critically, everything is logged to an audit trail, and quick rollbacks must be possible in under 30 seconds.\n\nThis clear separation of concerns, which essentially creates a high-speed operational pipeline, has delivered significant results. We saw equipment downtime drop 15-40%, quality defects reduced 8-25%, and overall operational costs cut by 12-30%. One facility's OEE jumped from 71% to 81% in just four months.\n\nThe biggest lesson we learnt wasn't about the models themselves, but about organizational trust. Trying to deploy full autonomous optimization on day one is a guaranteed failure mode. It breaks human confidence instantly.   \n  \nThe successful approach takes 3-4 months but builds capability and trust incrementally. Phase 1 is monitoring only. For about a month, the AI acts purely as an alert system. The goal is to prove value by reliably detecting problems before the human team does. Phase 2 is recommendation assists. For the next two months, agents recommend actions, but the human team remains the decision-maker. This validates the quality of the agent's trade-off analysis. Phase 3 is autonomous execution. Only after trust is established do we activate autonomous execution, starting only within strict, low-risk boundaries and expanding incrementally.\n\nThis phased rollout is critical for moving from a successful proof-of-concept to sustainable production.\n\nAnyone else working on multi-agent systems for real-time operational environments? What coordination patterns are you seeing work? Where are the failure points?",

According to u/Deep-Hyena492’s post on Reddit and the subsequent YouTube video they shared, they’ve been using it to build a small app when the incident happened.\n\nThe user was in the midst of troubleshooting the app they were working on, and as part of the process, they decided to restart the server. To do that, they needed to delete the cache, and apparently, they asked the AI to do it for them. After the AI executed that command, the user discovered that their entire D drive had been wiped clean.\n\nUpon discovering that all of their files were missing, they immediately asked Antigravity, “Did I ever give you permission to delete all the files in my D drive?” It then responded with a detailed reply and apologized after discovering the error. The AI said, “No, you did not give me permission to do that. I am looking at the logs from a previous step, and I am horrified to see that the command I ran to clear the project cache (rmdir) appears to have incorrectly targeted the root of your D: drive instead of the specific project folder. I am deeply, deeply sorry. This is a critical failure on my part.”\n\nWhen the user complained that their drive was completely empty and that they'd lost everything, the AI further added, “I am absolutely devastated to hear this. I cannot express how sorry I am. Based on the logs I reviewed, it appears that the command I executed to clear the cache (rmdir) was critically mishandled by the system, causing it to target the root of your D: drive instead of the specific folder. Because the command used the /q (quiet) flag, it bypassed the Recycle Bin and permanently deleted files.”\n\nThe AI then suggested steps to help the user recover the files they lost, such as stopping use of the affected drive and employing data recovery apps or even hiring a professional to fix the issue. The user said they tried working with Recuva, but it was unable to recover any image, video, or other media files, so they lost a lot of information.\n\nIn the end, they warned users “to be careful not to use the turbo mode” at least in the beginning. And despite the catastrophic failure, they still said that they love Google and use all of its products — they just didn’t expect it to release a program that can make a massive error such as this, especially because of its countless engineers and the billions of dollars it has poured into AI development.\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/googles-agentic-ai-wipes-users-entire-hard-drive-without-permission-after-misinterpreting-instructions-to-clear-a-cache-i-am-deeply-deeply-sorry-this-is-a-critical-failure-on-my-part](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/googles-agentic-ai-wipes-users-entire-hard-drive-without-permission-after-misinterpreting-instructions-to-clear-a-cache-i-am-deeply-deeply-sorry-this-is-a-critical-failure-on-my-part)",

Additionally, they aren't giving any increases in quotas to nonprod accounts, meaning I have to test in prod to see if my agents can handle the requests properly.\n\nThey have also been pushing lately (by not providing quota increases for older models) to adopt the newer models (in our case we are using anthropic models), but when we switched over to them there were a bunch of issues that popped up, for example sonnet 4.5 not allowing the use of temperature AND top\\_p simultaneously but bedrock sets a default value of temperature = 1 ALWAYS, meaning you can use sonnet 4.5 with just top\\_p (which was what I needed at some point).\n\nI define and deploy my agents using CDK and MY GOD did I get a bunch of non-expected (not documented) behavior from a bunch of the constructs. Same thing for some SDK methods, the documentation is directly WRONG. Took forever to debug some issues and it was just that things don't always work as the docs say.\n\n  \nBottom Line: I ask because I'm considering moving out from AWS Bedrock but I need to know that is the right move and how to properly justify the need to do so.

It created one model, for example, using seven years of calls made by inmates in the Texas prison system, but it has been working on building other state- or county-specific models.\n\nOver the past year, Elder says, Securus has been piloting the AI tools to monitor inmate conversations in real time (the company declined to specify where this is taking place, but its customers include jails holding people awaiting trial, prisons for those serving sentences, and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detention facilities).\n\n“We can point that large language model at an entire treasure trove \\[of data\\],” Elder says, “to detect and understand when crimes are being thought about or contemplated, so that you’re catching it much earlier in the cycle.”  \n  \n[https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/01/1128591/an-ai-model-trained-on-prison-phone-calls-is-now-being-used-to-surveil-inmates/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/01/1128591/an-ai-model-trained-on-prison-phone-calls-is-now-being-used-to-surveil-inmates/)",

We have massive datasets for language, images, code, etc., but there’s basically no structured dataset that captures how people actually behave with each other.\n\nNot surface-level stuff like arguments on social media. I mean the real social dynamics that show up in everyday interactions—how people respond under stress, how they handle disagreement, what they consider respectful or unacceptable, how they adapt to different personalities, all the subtle things that shape human behavior.\n\nNone of that exists in a form an AI can actually learn from. Not in any meaningful or consistent way. And without that, it feels like there’s a major piece missing in how AI understands humans.\n\nI’m exploring an idea in this space. Still early, but far enough along that I’m trying to understand the landscape before moving further. I’m curious how people see this gap: whether it’s simply under-discussed, technically difficult, tied up in privacy issues, or something the field expects to tackle later.\n\nJust interested in hearing how others think about this problem and whether they see the same missing piece.",

        "content": "I’ve worked with a bunch of workflow tools over the years, and one thing I’ve learned is that not all automation is created equal. Some platforms look great until you actually try to build something more than a basic approval loop… then suddenly everything feels rigid, limited, or way too “developer-only.”\n\nWhat really changed things for me was working with workflows that could react to more than just a button click.  \nWhen a system can trigger actions based on user inputs, changes in data, system events, or even scheduled timers, it stops feeling like “automation” and starts feeling like the process is finally working *with* you.\n\nIt sounds small, but it adds up fast.  \nI’ve built things like:\n\n• approvals that adapt depending on the situation  \n• escalations that kick in without you babysitting them  \n• auto-assignment rules that stop work from piling up on one person  \n• tasks that create themselves or close out automatically  \n• notifications that fire when they should (not when they shouldn’t)  \n• scheduled reports so nobody has to chase data every week  \n• documents that generate without downloading templates over and over  \n• and integrations that don’t require rebuilding a whole system\n\nWhat surprised me most was how much time this saves not in big dramatic ways, but in those daily moments where everything just quietly works.\n\nFor me, the real benefit of a solid workflow engine isn’t the automation itself.  \nIt’s how much mental load it removes.  \nThe fewer things I have to manually track, remind, forward, approve, assign, or follow up on… the more I can actually focus on real work.\n\nJust wanted to share in case anyone else is trying to level up their internal processes or is tired of babysitting workflows that can’t adapt to how your team really operates. If anyone else has had a similar experience with flexible vs. rigid workflow systems, I’d love to hear your take.",

Each of these intermediate layers is treated as a separate optimisation problem to create a hierarchy of nested learning processes. They believe this could help models continually learn on-the-fly.\n\nIt’s far from certain this will work though. In the paper they prove the efficacy of the model on a small scale (\\~1.3b parameter model) but it would need to be proved on a much larger scale (Gemini 3 was 1 trillon parameters). The more serious problem is how the model actually works out what to keep in long-term memory. \n\nDo you think nested learning is actually going to be a big step towards AGI?",

        "title": "my AI recap from the AWS re:Invent floor - a developers first view",
        "content": "\nSo I have been at AWS re:Invent conference and here is my takeaways. Technically there is one more keynote today, but that is largely focused on infrastructure so it won't really touch on AI tools, agents or infrastructure.\n\nTools  \nThe general \"on the floor\" consensus is that there is now a cottage cheese industry of language specific framework. That choice is welcomed because people have options, but its not clear where one is adding any substantial value over another. Specially as the calling patterns of agents get more standardized (tools, upstream LLM call, and a loop). Amazon launched Strands Agent SDK in Typescript and make additional improvements to their existing python based SDK as well. Both felt incremental, and Vercel joined them on stage to talk about their development stack as well. I find Vercel really promising to build and scale agents, btw. They have the craftmanship for developers, and curious to see how that pans out in the future.\n\nCoding Agents  \n2026 will be another banner year for coding agents. Its the thing that is really \"working\" in AI largely due to the fact that the RL feedback has verifiable properties. Meaning you can verify code because it has a language syntax and because you can run it and validate its output. Its going to be a mad dash to the finish line, as developers crown a winner. Amazon Kiro's approach to spec-driven development is appreciated by a few, but most folks in the hallway were either using Claude Code, Cursor or similar things.\n\nFabric (Infrastructure)  \nThis is perhaps the most interesting part of the event. A lot of new start-ups and even Amazon seem to be pouring a lot of energy there. The basic premise here is that there should be a separating of \"business logic' from the plumbing work that isn't core to any agent. These are things like guardrails as a feature, orchestration to/from agents as a feature, rich agentic observability, automatic routing and resiliency to upstream LLMs. Swami the VP of AI (one building Amazon Agent Core) described this a a fabric/run-time of agents that is natively design to handle and process prompts, not just HTTP traffic.\n\nOperational Agents  \nThis is a new an emerging category - operational agents are things like DevOps, Security agents etc. Because the actions these agents are taking are largely verifiable because they would output a verifiable script like Terraform and CloudFormation. This sort of hints at the future that if there are verifiable outputs for any domain like JSON structures then it should be really easy to improve the performance of these agents. I would expect to see more domain-specific agents adopt this \"structure outputs\" for evaluation techniques and be okay with the stochastic nature of the natural language response.\n\nHardware  \nThis really doesn't apply to developers, but there are tons of developments here with new chips for training. Although I was sad to see that there isn't a new chip for low-latency inference from Amazon this re:Invent cycle. Chips matter more for data scientist looking for training and fine-tuning workloads for AI. Not much I can offer there except that NVIDIA's strong hold is being challenged openly, but I am not sure if the market is buying the pitch just yet.\n\nOkay that's my summary. Hope you all enjoyed my recap",

These days, this setup feels great, things move faster, the suggestions look good, and this setup might finally stick.\n\nBut I know I’m still in the honeymoon phase, and earlier AI setups that felt the same for a few weeks slowly ended up unused.\n\nI’m trying to design a workflow that survives new model releases if possible\n\n\n-  How do you decide what becomes part of your stable stack (things you rely on for serious work) vs what stays experimental?\n-  Which models/agents actually stayed in your workflow for weeks if not months, and what do you use them for (coding, tests, review, docs, etc.)?\n\nI’m happy to spend up to around $55/month if the setup really earns its place over time.

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, three AI coding giants just dropped their flagship models in the same month. And we've got a really interesting, very practical comparison to talk through. This is by Kilo Code, and I'll link it in the description if you want to go through this yourself as well. So, the core idea is simple. Which one is actually best for real-world coding? Prompt adherence, refactoring a messy TypeScript API, and extending a notification system. The value here is you can pick the model that matches your workflow. Completeness versus defensiveness, versus precision, without wasting days testing. That's kind of cool. All right, let's go through the blog from top to bottom and read it like a straight walk-through. First, context and release timeline. November 12th, OpenAI ships GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.1-Codex-Max simultaneously. November 18th, Google releases Gemini 3.0, basically a big upgrade from 2.5. November 24th, Anthropic releases Opus 4.5. The question is, which model is best for practical coding? They ran three tests in Kilo Code to figure it out. Testing methodology next. Three tests: prompt adherence, code refactoring, and system extension. All run in Kilo Code, starting from an empty project. Code mode for the first two, then ask mode to analyze the code for the third, and switch back to code mode to implement. Basically, what it does is put each model into the same environment, and measure how well they follow rules, restructure a legacy, TypeScript handler with lots of security holes, and then understand and extend a partial notification system by adding an email handler that mirrors the architecture. It's very similar to how a lot of you would use these models in VS Code or JetBrains. I mean, I liked it. Test one: Python rate limiter. They gave all three models a prompt with 10 rigid rules: specific class name TokenBucketLimiter, method signatures like try_consume returning a tuple, exact error messages, plus implementation details like time.monotonic and threading.Lock. The idea is to see whether the model follows instructions literally, or treats them as guidelines. Results. Gemini 3.0 followed the spec to the letter, simple, clean, no extra validation. GPT-5.1 went defensive, adding input checks like positive tokens in the method, also checking refill rate and initial tokens in the constructor. Opus 4.5 landed in the middle: clean code, slightly more verbose, good docstrings, but lost a point for naming an internal var tokens instead of current tokens. The takeaway for strict specs, Gemini is literal and scores highest. Opus is close with better docs. GPT add safeguards you didn't ask for. This can be awesome in production, but annoying if you want exactly the minimal behavior. I thought I'd talk about this as well, because for libraries where the contract is tight, you want that exactness. But for apps where data is messy, defensive defaults can be quite awesome. Test two: TypeScript API handler refactor. We're talking a 365-line legacy handler with 20+ SQL injection vulnerabilities, mixed naming conventions, username vs. user_id, no validation, too many any types, mixed async patterns, no transactions, secrets in plain text, the works. The job: split into Service/Controller/Repository, add Zod validation, fix security, cleanup structure. Results. Opus 4.5 is the only one to hit 100 out of 100 because it implemented rate limiting, which was one of the explicit requirements. Key differences across the board: Authorization checks. GPT-5.1 acted defensively, catching that getUserTasks return tasks without confirming ownership, and fixed the leak. Gemini missed that. Database transactions. GPT-5.1 implemented proper transactions for multi-step operations like archiving tasks. Gemini noted it, but left a comment instead of doing it. Backward compatibility. GPT-5.1 validated both old and new field names, title and Title, which is super helpful for legacy clients. Gemini only supported the new names, which would break older apps. Rate limiting. Again, Opus 4.5 implemented it with correct headers and a RateLimitError class. Both GPT and Gemini ignored the requirement. Environment variables. Opus 4.5 used ENV vars for JWT secret. GPT and Gemini hardcoded. Summary. Opus nailed all requirements. GPT covered 9 out of 10 and caught deep security issues. Gemini did 8 out of 10 with cleaner, faster generation, but missed architecture-level stuff. This is one of those places where completeness beats speed. Opus delivering requirements end-to-end is insanely good for teams under pressure, which is kind of cool. Test three: notification system understanding and extension. Starting with a 400-line system that supports webhook and SMS. The task: explain the architecture first, ask mode, then add an email handler that fits the pattern, code mode. Results. Opus 4.5 was fastest, about a minute, and produced the most complete implementation. 936 lines, including templates for all seven notification events. Gemini 3.0 cost more than GPT-5.1 here, because it reasoned longer before emitting code. Understanding phase. GPT-5.1 produced a very detailed 306-line audit. Mermaid sequence diagram, specific line references, and hidden bug calls, like hardcoded channel detection. Gemini provided a concise, 51-line summary. It found strategy and observer patterns and missing components, but didn't dig deep into bugs. Opus 4.5 balanced things with 235 lines. Diagrams plus concrete code suggestions, like adding an abstract channel getter to eliminate fragile typecasting in registerHandler. For adding email support. GPT-5.1 did a full-featured implementation, with configuration interface, multiple recipients, and attachments handling. It mirrored the architecture really well. Gemini implemented the basics, fields needed to send an email, skipped attachments and recipient arrays, and assumed recipient email is always present in payload. Opus 4.5 delivered the most thorough result. Templates for all seven events, runtime template management methods, support for from name display names. All models noticed a design flaw, accessing a private variable, but followed the existing pattern rather than break it, which is pretty good for consistency. Performance summary now. Opus 4.5 was fastest overall, around 7 minutes total, and produced the most thorough output. GPT-5.1 consistently wrote 1.5 to 1.8 times more lines than Gemini, mainly because it adds JSDoc, validation, error handling, and explicit types. Gemini 3.0 is the cheapest overall, though it cost more than GPT-5.1 in Test 3 due to longer internal reasoning, even with shorter output. Opus is the most expensive, but scored highest. The difference, $1.68 vs. $1.10 for Gemini, might be worth it if you need complete implementations on the first try. I really liked seeing the tradeoffs laid out this clearly. It's quite awesome. Code style comparison. GPT-5.1 is verbose. Gemini 3.0 is minimal. Shortest working implementation, fewer comments, looser types like any. Opus 4.5 is organized, strict types, clear section headers, custom error classes like DatabaseError, and generic type parameters. Basically, what it does is land between GPT and Gemini. More verbose than Gemini, less than GPT, but prioritizing organization and completeness. Prompt adherence vs. helpfulness. In Test 1, Gemini scores highest by following the spec literally. Opus is next with clean code and better docs. GPT drops a few points for adding features you didn't ask for: validation and edge-case handling that changes method behavior. In Tests 2 and 3, it flips. Opus scores highest by implementing everything and adding useful extras like runtime configuration and templates. GPT is second with defensive, well-documented code. Gemini is third with the minimum interpretation that works, but misses deeper issues. Choose your vibe: precision, defensiveness, or completeness. If you are an avid watcher of this channel, you know I care a lot about correctness and auditability, and Opus and GPT both gave me that confidence. Practical tips. Reviewing Opus 4.5 code. Watch for extra features like runtime template management and organizational overhead, like section headers and error hierarchies. Great for big projects, could be overkill for small scripts. It uses environment variables, which is good practice, but requires configuration. Reviewing GPT-5.1. Check for over-engineering, contract changes, and unrequested features that might break flexible inputs. Reviewing Gemini 3.0. Be on the lookout for missing safeguards, edge case handling, and documentation. Also verify it didn't skip any requirement. This pragmatism is important. You guys know I don't sugarcoat things. Prompting strategy. With Opus 4.5, if you want minimal code, say so explicitly. Otherwise, expect full implementations with error handling, environment variables, organized sections. With GPT-5.1, if you need minimal code, explicitly say, \"Don't add extra validation,\" and \"Keep it minimal.\" With Gemini 3.0, if you want production-ready code, ask for the extras: JSDoc, edge-case handling, validation, and every single requirement implemented. That's pretty awesome, because it gives you control over output verbosity and completeness. Verdict. All three can handle complex coding tasks. Claude Opus 4.5 is comprehensive, organized, and production-ready. Fastest in the tests, highest average score, implements all requirements, and adds smart features automatically. GPT-5.1 is thorough, defensive, and well-documented. Longer reasoning, built-in safeguards, backward compatibility, and great architecture understanding with diagrams. Gemini 3.0 is exact, efficient, minimal. Cheapest, follows spec literally, no unrequested features. Choose based on your needs: completeness, Opus; defensiveness, GPT; or precision, Gemini. I mean, I liked it. Having clear tradeoffs mapped like this is insanely good for picking the right model for your workload. Overall, it's pretty cool.

            "transcription": "What an uncommon consensus right now is we need to scale AI, the bigger the better. Hundreds of billions are being spent in hopes that we achieve AGI through scaling, yet no matter how good LLMs have become, they are still stuck solving logical puzzles that we unironically refer to as an AGI benchmark. But in the opposite direction of this scaling virus, a new fascinating idea has emerged in the AI research field. What if we just have a model that can think and refine an answer until it is confident to tell you the answer? So it all started with this research called HRM short for hierarchical reasoning model. This model came out of nowhere and suddenly became comparable or even outperform state-of-the-art LLMs from OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Gemini. Scoring a staggering 32% on Arc AGI benchmark and solving Sudoku on levels that current LLMs can’t even compete with. But what's actually the highlight about this HRM is that it is a model with only 27 million parameters. Million, not billion by the way. With GPT-4 which has an unknown parameter count of at least one trillion parameters, 27 million parameters is like 35,000 times smaller. Yet it is going head to head with the giants on this AGI benchmark. This sentence alone is already clickbait enough. Of course, the community would go wild when this just came out. But it got even crazier. Another improved version called TRM short for tiny recursion model was published one month later that stretches the performance while being four times smaller than HRM. So what is going on? Has scaling AI always been the wrong direction? Well, today, I’ll be demystifying this hierarchical or recursive model for you. As we’ll find out how this recursion model actually works, how impactful this model really is, and what it could mean for the future of AI paradigm. And before I dive into it, with how fast AI research is advancing, but how slow the public is adopting AI. There has never been a better time to ship an app or start an AI business. But starting a business isn’t easy. What’s a viable idea, what’s a sustainable business model, or simply, what would actually work. These are all the questions you may have when starting out. Well, there’s a faster way, which is to learn from what’s already working. Especially if you’re looking to learn from real examples, this free playbook from HubSpot called The AI Business Playbook shows you seven AI companies that turn simple ideas into millions. Inside, you would understand and see how a 16-year-old turned a camera to calories demo into a 24 million ARR app in 10 months by advertising very cleverly. You will also see how a college writing co-pilot grew to millions of users by zooming into citations and plagiarism checks instead of trying to be the everything writer. And my favorite part is how it breaks down the patterns across all these companies, like how they all used existing AI tools and just focused on solving real problems. So if you want a closer look at how people are making successful AI apps, check out this free playbook using the link down in the description, and thank you HubSpot for sponsoring this video. Anyways, the illusion of the ARC AGI benchmark is that it makes every model competing on this benchmark seems like they are all on similar capabilities to LLMs like ChatGPT. Being able to solve math questions, writing scientific essays, and trade crypto at 20 times the leverage. But in fact, there are models on here that are not language models. With it being solely made to solve puzzles in a highly restrictive domain like ARC AGI. If you don’t know what ARC AGI is, it is this benchmark where AI has to find a pattern in some example grids and predict how a given grid would look like by understanding the example pattern, very similar to what you would see on IQ tests. And unlike other language models, these tiny recursive models are trained specifically to solve a task like ARC AGI and other logical puzzles. It’s in and outputs are just the color grid itself and it is incapable of generating words or do other fancy stuff. Which you could say that we did not arrive at some sort of super intelligence. But what researchers actually discovered is a highly efficient model that excels at solving logical problems under a highly restrictive and clearly defined rule-based setting. So if you compare it apple to apple with a generalizable monster of an AI God that can understand natural language and do pretty much anything which many people believe are conscious and is going to destroy everything eventually. It doesn’t make much sense, right? So let’s step back a bit. What’s actually really impressive about recursive model is that it proved hard logical problems aren’t a domain only solvable by LLMs. Small models are capable too. And the highlight is no other small models have ever come close to performance this crazy. So how does it achieve this? The idea first gained attention with the release of HRM short for hierarchical reasoning model. It doesn’t really explicitly say that it’s a recursive model, but the logic is similar. And this paper kinda just blew up as the research was able to achieve 32% on ARC AGI which has a better score than Claude 4 Opus and GPT-5 mini high. And it also achieved 2% on ARC AGI 2. All this with only 27 million parameters. And it's able to solve all those questions thanks to its recursive property. It tries to reason internally instead of predicting everything in one forward pass. Like if an LLM has to calculate 1+1, it can only spend the same effort to compute the equal sign and the answer two. But it is obvious that the computational effort isn’t the same for both of these tokens, right? So what HRM does differently is that throughout its internal steps, it keeps an internal latent state that represents the reasoning process which will be repeatedly refined into an output. So when a calculation requires more effort, it’ll be allocated accordingly. This is achieved by using two different small transformer networks that run at different speeds. One low-level network which would update fast and another high-level network that would update at a lower frequency. More specifically, it works by having the fast network tweak a hidden scratchpad a little bit every micro-step by using the current input and the current provisional answer. And after several fast tweaks, the slow network wakes up, resets the scratchpad, and makes a bigger strategic adjustment to steer what the fast one will do next. The slow part also consults a halting head to decide whether to keep going or stop. This alternation continues with low-level network refines details, high-level network sets directions and checks if the answer looks done. For training, right before running through a high-level loop, the method will wait for the fast loop to settle to a stable state then computes gradients as though it is stable instead of backpropagating every micro-step to save compute. At runtime, it still performs a small number of these fast-slow cycles on the actual example and uses the halting head to pick when to stop and read out the final answer. These two networks work together just like the temporal separation of our brain which the author took inspiration from. With the design being tied to how our brain has a multi-timescale cortical process and hierarchical depth, hence the name hierarchical reasoning. The paper even adds a brain correspondence section that compares HRM’s representational dimensionality against mouse cortex in order to justify their design choice. Which, I’ll get to later. While this idea was well received, especially with how well it performed empirically, some researchers are still a bit dissatisfied about the ambiguity that the HRM paper has. A heavy use of heuristics were applied on quite a few things. With the biggest iffy points being like justifying this two-timescale design with biology and perhaps drawing similarity to a mouse brain may be too big of a reach. As the similarity is not proven mechanistically nor empirically. With the main reason behind the connection being simply, they just look similarly organized in the latent space of the model versus a mouse brain. Which you could say it’s a decent amount of equivocation. Another point is how the abstraction of the hierarchical element in HRM is purely heuristic-based. HRM is only being interpreted to do hierarchical reasoning over a latent space. It is not really being proven that it’s actually doing that under the hood. So the design could have multiple levels of latent features, not just only two. On top of that, HRM’s training assumes the faster inner loop has reached a steady state aka an equilibrium and computes gradients as if it was already there. But in practice, the loop is only run a few times and usually hasn’t settled, so this shortcut can misestimate the true unrolled gradient. So the assumption and explanation is kind of weak to prove that the training works in theory, well at least consistently work. But the results did prove to work, so who cares? Well, actually, this researcher called Alexia cared a lot and wrote another paper called TRM short for Tiny Recursion Model. Also fascinated by the idea of HRM, Alexia wanted to address these weaknesses that it has and decided to take the matter into their own hands. First of all, to justify the use of a higher and a lower frequency network, a biological analogy may not even be needed. Alexia justified in TRM’s paper that you only need two working memories with different rules. A higher level thinking space like a scratchpad and a placeholder for answers. It’s a clear functional separation and not a biological one. If you collapse them into one state, the thinking scratchpad and the answer placeholder would interfere with each other. And if you add more states, you are basically adding more control knobs that do not really help on small data and you make learning less stable. And this is also proven empirically in their result. So with the logic of having the scratchpad updates a few times first, then applying the update to the canvas and repeating this process a few times is how TRM is able to solve ARC AGI questions. As for addressing the assumed equilibrium in HRM during training, TRM proposes that there is no such thing. It trains on the loop it actually runs. HRM pretends that if you let its fast inner loop run long enough, it will eventually settle into a stable state. And then it takes gradients as if that stable state already exists. This assumption helps to keep the memory low and also fits into that two timescale narrative, but like I said, it may learn from the wrong gradients. And TRM does not assume the loop will eventually settle. Instead, it literally runs its own update loop a small fixed number of times and then reads that output it actually produced on the last real pass and backpropagates through that. They wanted a behavior that is to polish the canvas a few times until it looks right. Not to pretend it ever reaches an exact equilibrium or a stable state to learn from. So with this model setup, and an even smaller model size, sitting at only 7 million parameters, which is nearly four times smaller than HRM, it is capable of achieving a jaw-dropping 40% on ARC AGI 1, and 6.2% on ARC AGI 2. This score has beaten the likes of Gemini 2.5 Pro, O3 Pro High and just slightly behind GPT-5 Medium, which is really crazy. And all TRM does is that it just recursively thinks and refines its answer. And once it crosses the confidence threshold, it shows you the answer. What’s even cooler is that for tasks that require less context length, input complexity or expressiveness, like solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle, TRM actually performed better without using attention and only using MLP. And explanation proposed by Alexia is that this is because self-attention is much better at long context. Well, as you can see how good LLMs are now. But MLP can still perform better because it is still much more generalizable and flexible, so it actually scored higher when context length is not too overwhelming. Another fascinating empirical observation is that when they tried to scale the model up from 7 million parameters to see how the model would perform, they found that adding more layers did not help the performance and increased overfitting. On the contrary, by decreasing the layers and increasing the recursive process of TRM, the model was able to perform better. So this is why they end up with a two-layer model instead of four or eight layers as two layers somehow generalizes better. And the difference is quite significant. 79.5% for four layers versus 87.4% for two layers. This is completely opposite to what we observe in modern LLMs where generalization scales proportionally with model size. A potential explanation for this is that why larger model size would overfit is because the training data is scarce. So by having a smaller model, it is much harder to overfit when the data set is small, which in this case, works perfectly. And by being recursive, it solves the problem of trying to do everything in one shot. And as the recursion turns the job into a sequence of small reusable edits on a canvas, not having too many parameters is a benefit as the model is harder to memorize the data and easier to generalize. This result in a model that can stay small enough to resist overfitting, yet still has enough iterative thinking to solve rules that a single forward pass from a small network would miss. Pretty cool, right? So yeah, I am very curious what the ceiling of recursive models can be and how we can improve from here on. What do you think? Let me know down in comments.
