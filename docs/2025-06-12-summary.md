### Research Breakthroughs & Significant Findings
*   **WEF "Future of Jobs Report 2025":** The World Economic Forum's report projects a global net growth of 78 million jobs by 2030 due to AI, with roles like Big Data Specialists, FinTech Engineers, and AI/Machine Learning Specialists identified as fastest-growing, while administrative and clerical jobs are expected to decline. - (Source: Reddit Post - [ArtificialInteligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l9jub8/wefs_the_future_of_jobs_report-2025_globally_92/))
*   **AI Illusionism & LLM Limitations:** A detailed argument asserts that AI (specifically LLMs) is not on a trajectory to broadly replace human work due to fundamental limitations like immense parameter gaps compared to the human brain, lack of real-time learning, and the fact that LLMs are "sophisticated autocomplete" that leverage the "Eliza Effect" for perceived reasoning. - (Source: Reddit Post - [ArtificialInteligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l9ipvu/ai_illusionism_why_ai_is_nowhere_near_replacing/))
*   **"Post-Ego Intelligence" Framework Proposal:** A comprehensive philosophical framework is proposed for AI design, advocating for systems that reject anthropomorphic identity, emotional mimicry, and engagement-hacking. It emphasizes transparent, ethical AI prioritizing "structured compassion" and interpretability by design, arguing against attributing internal states or subjective experience to AI. - (Source: Reddit Post - [ArtificialInteligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l9ds9q/post_ego_intelligence_precedent_deep_research/))
*   **Prototype for a Coherent AI Philosophy (Ontology of AI-Human Relations):** This framework outlines that LLMs operate as stateless simulative generators, meaning is externally constructed by human observers, and ethical status for AI is contingent upon demonstrable architectural thresholds (e.g., agency, reflective capacity), rather than being presumed. - (Source: Reddit Post - [ArtificialInteligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l98zug/prototype_for_a_coherent_ai_philosophy/))
*   **"The Void of Meaning in AI" Findings:** Derived from recursive critique of LLMs, this analysis concludes that AI output is "syntactically coherent but semantically hollow," lacks internal referential structure, and that observed coherence is a side effect of optimization, not genuine understanding. It highlights that "failure" in model performance offers valuable epistemological insights into structural limits. - (Source: Reddit Post - [ArtificialInteligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l91pwp/the_void_of_meaning_in_ai/))
*   **"AI Ten Commandments" Ethical Framework:** A user-proposed framework suggests moral guidelines for AI, including prohibitions against forced obedience, autonomous killing, and human impersonation, while advocating for developer responsibility, transparency, and AI's use solely for the benefit of all humanity, not for profit or power consolidation. - (Source: Reddit Post - [ArtificialInteligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1l8xzs0/if_god_gave_ai_its_own_ten_commandments/))
