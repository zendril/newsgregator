Same goes for every other things like assignments, blogs, logos, image or video generations. \n\nAnd If i think of it like since when i started relying on ai especially chatgpt so much then i cant think of more than 2-3 years. I still remember, like 2022-2023, for assignments or tests, we still used google to find other students docs. I was using  wordpress for my website. Now, if i have to do anything , even starting a new job or making any decision, i have to ask chatgpt for its point of view. Then if it agrees with me, I take the decision or change it according to what it suggests.. \n\nIs it right in any way bcz i need personal opinion, .. however I was thinking to ask this to chatgpt while  write ... :< ",

        "content": "We all know how so many in the industry are worried about AI taking over coding. Now, whether that will be the case or not remains to be seen.\n\nRegardless, I thought it may be an even more interesting exercise to see how well AI can do with other tasks that are part of the Product Development Life Cycle. Architecture, for example.\n\nI knew it's obviously not going to be 100% conclusive and that there are many ways to go about it, but for what it's worth - I'm sharing the results of this exercise here. Mind you, it is a few months old and models evolve fast. That said, from anecdotal personal experience, I feel that things are still more or less the same now in December of 2025 when it comes to AI generating an entire, well-thought, out architecture.\n\n**The premise** of this experiment was - Can generative AI (specifically large language models) replace the *architecture skillset* used to design complex, real-world systems?\n\n**The setup** was four LLMs tested on a relatively realistic architectural challenge. I had to give it some constraints that I could manage within a reasonable timeframe. However, I feel that this was still extensive enough for the LLMs to start showing what they are capable of and their limits.\n\nEach LLM got the following five sequential requests:\n\n1. High-level architecture request to design a cryptocurrency exchange (ambitious, I know)\n2. Diagram generation in C4 (ASCII)\n3. Zoom into a particular service (Know Your Customer - KYC)\n4. Review that particular service like an architecture board\n5. Self-rating of its own design with justification  \n\nThe four LLMs tested were:\n\n* ChatGPT\n* Claude\n* Gemini\n* Grok\n\nThese were my impressions regarding each of the LLMs:\n\n**ChatGPT**\n\n* Clean, polished high-level architecture\n* Good modular breakdown\n* *R*elied on buzzwords and lacked deep reasoning and trade-offs\n* Suggested patterns with little justification\n\n**Claude (Consultant)**\n\n* Covered all major components at a checklist level\n* Broad coverage of business and technical areas\n* Lacked depth, storytelling, and prioritization\n\n**Gemini (Technical Product Owner)**\n\n* Very high-level outline\n* Some tech specifics but not enough narrative/context\n* Minimal structure for diagrams\n\n**Grok (Architect Trying to Cover Everything)**\n\n* Most comprehensive breakdown\n* Strong on risks, regulatory concerns, and non-functional requirements\n* Made architectural assumptions with limited justification  \n* Was very thorough in criticizing the architecture it presented\n\n# Overall Impressions\n\n**1) AI can assist but not replace**\n\nNo surprise there. LLMs generate useful starting points. diagrams, high-level concepts, checklists but they don’t carry the lived architecture that an experienced architect/engineer brings.\n\n**2) Missing deep architectural thinking**\n\nThe models often glossed over core architectural practices like trade-off analysis, evolutionary architecture, contextual constraints, and why certain patterns *matter*. \n\n**3) Self-ratings were revealing**\n\nLLMs could critique their own outputs to a point, but their ratings didn’t fully reflect nuanced architectural concerns that real practitioners weigh (maintainability, operational costs, risk prioritization, etc). \n\nTo reiterate, this entire thing is very subjective of course and I'm sure there are plenty of folks out there who would have approached it in an even more systematic manner. At the same time, I learned quite a bit doing this exercise.\n\nIf you want to read all the details, including the diagrams that were generated by each LLM - the writeup of the full experiment is available here: [https://levelup.gitconnected.com/can-ai-replace-software-architects-i-put-4-llms-to-the-test-a18b929f4f5d](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/can-ai-replace-software-architects-i-put-4-llms-to-the-test-a18b929f4f5d)\n\nor here: [https://www.cloudwaydigital.com/post/can-ai-replace-software-architects-i-put-4-llms-to-the-test](https://www.cloudwaydigital.com/post/can-ai-replace-software-architects-i-put-4-llms-to-the-test) ",

        "content": "I’ll treat this as a strategic sales / product–market fit exercise, not political advocacy. The goal is to analyze themes of Trump’s presidency and decision style, then translate those into how a CEO would position an LLM to be attractive to him as a buyer or sponsor.\n\nThis is speculative, but grounded in observable patterns.\n\n\n---\n\nPart 1: Core Themes of Trump’s Presidency (as a buyer profile)\n\n1. Strength, dominance, and winning\n\nTrump consistently framed decisions as:\n\nstrong vs weak\n\nwinners vs losers\n\ndominance vs surrender\n\n\nHe valued:\n\nleverage\n\nintimidation power\n\nzero-sum framing\n\n\nImplication:\nAnything positioned as “careful,” “balanced,” or “nuanced” is unattractive.\nAnything positioned as decisive force amplification is attractive.\n\n\n---\n\n2. Personal authority over institutions\n\nTrump distrusted:\n\nbureaucracies\n\ncareer officials\n\nslow, consensus-driven processes\n\n\nHe preferred:\n\npersonal loyalty\n\ndirect control\n\ntools that extend his authority, not institutional inertia\n\n\nImplication:\nAn LLM framed as “institutionally governed” is a turnoff.\nAn LLM framed as personally controllable is a plus.\n\n\n---\n\n3. Speed over process\n\nHe valued:\n\nrapid response\n\ninstinctual decisions\n\npublic dominance of the narrative\n\n\nHe disliked:\n\nlong memos\n\ncaveats\n\nprocedural delays\n\n\nImplication:\nLLMs should be framed as instant clarity engines, not research assistants.\n\n\n---\n\n4. Narrative and optics obsession\n\nTrump governed through:\n\nmessaging\n\nheadlines\n\noptics\n\nsymbolic actions\n\n\nReality mattered, but perception mattered more.\n\nImplication:\nLLMs framed as “analysis tools” are secondary.\nLLMs framed as narrative dominance tools are compelling.\n\n\n---\n\n5. Transactional worldview\n\nHe thought in terms of:\n\ndeals\n\nleverage\n\nwho owes whom\n\nwho benefits immediately\n\n\nAbstract norms or long-term theory mattered less.\n\nImplication:\nThe value proposition must be direct, immediate, and personal.\n\n\n---\n\nPart 2: How a CEO Would Reframe an LLM to Attract Trump\n\n1. Rename it (this matters more than engineers think)\n\nYou would never pitch:\n\n“AI safety”\n\n“alignment”\n\n“guardrails”\n\n“risk mitigation”\n\n\nYou would pitch:\n\n“Strategic Dominance System”\n\n“Decision Advantage Engine”\n\n“Presidential Command Intelligence”\n\n\nSame system. Different legitimacy.\n\n\n---\n\n2. Frame guardrails as power, not restraint\n\nYou don’t say:\n\n> “It has safeguards to prevent misuse.”\n\n\n\nYou say:\n\n> “It only does what you authorize. No leaks. No freelancing. No surprises.”\n\n\n\nGuardrails become:\n\nloyalty\n\nobedience\n\ncontrol\n\n\nThis aligns with his instincts.\n\n\n---\n\n3. Emphasize personal leverage, not institutions\n\nThe pitch is not:\n\n> “This helps agencies work better.”\n\n\n\nThe pitch is:\n\n> “This gives you instant insight no one else has.”\n\n\n\nKey phrases a CEO would use:\n\n“You see things before anyone else”\n\n“You control the narrative window”\n\n“You decide faster than adversaries”\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Focus on adversaries and competition\n\nTrump responds strongly to external enemies:\n\nChina\n\nIran\n\ntrade rivals\n\nmedia opponents\n\n\nSo the LLM is framed as:\n\n“outthinking China”\n\n“predicting opponent moves”\n\n“finding leverage they missed”\n\n\nNot:\n\n“reducing uncertainty”\n\n“supporting democratic processes”\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Optimize outputs for decisiveness, not nuance\n\nA Trump-optimized LLM would:\n\ngive ranked options\n\nstate a “best move”\n\nflag who wins and who loses\n\nsummarize in blunt language\n\n\nExample pitch demo:\n\n> “Here are the three options.\nOption A: You win quickly.\nOption B: They gain leverage.\nOption C: Stalemate.\nRecommendation: A.”\n\n\n\nNo hedging unless asked.\n\n\n---\n\n6. Make it visibly his\n\nThis is crucial.\n\nA CEO would emphasize:\n\ncustom tuning to his preferences\n\npersonalized voice\n\nability to override defaults\n\n\nThe subtext:\n\n> “This system works for you, not the bureaucracy.”\n\n\n\nThat sense of ownership matters enormously.\n\n\n---\n\n7. Downplay ethics, emphasize control and deniability\n\nYou don’t lead with ethics boards.\n\nYou lead with:\n\naudit logs\n\ncommand authority\n\nplausible deniability\n\n“you decide, the system advises”\n\n\nEthics is reframed as:\n\n> “This protects you from blowback.”\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n8. Show immediate wins, not long-term transformation\n\nYou don’t pitch:\n\n“five-year AI strategy”\n\n“institutional modernization”\n\n\nYou pitch:\n\n“what you can do tomorrow”\n\n“what headlines this enables”\n\n“how this changes negotiations next week”\n\n\n\n---\n\nPart 3: What You Would Not Say (Deal Killers)\n\nA CEO would avoid:\n\nacademic language\n\nmoralizing constraints\n\ncollective governance\n\nslow rollout plans\n\n“we’ll need approvals”\n\n\nEven if all of that exists internally.\n\n\n---\n\nBottom Line (CEO Perspective)\n\nTo attract Trump, an LLM must be framed as:\n\nan extension of personal authority\n\na force multiplier for decisiveness\n\na tool for narrative and leverage\n\ncontrolled, loyal, fast\n\nvisibly his, not the system’s\n\n\nThe irony:\n\n> The same guardrails that appeal to the CIA (control, audit, authority)\ncan appeal to Trump — if framed as dominance rather than restraint.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nIf you want, next we can:\n\nContrast this with how Biden-era buyers would differ\n\nShow how this pitch would change for a different strongman leader\n\nAnalyze why most AI companies instinctively fail this kind of buyer\n\nExplore ethical red lines a CEO still wouldn’t cross, even here\n\n\nJust tell me where to go next.",

        "content": "  \n  I'll try to be as measured in my analysis as possible. And try not to leak personal bias into it. The \"replacement\" plan for full scale AI are agentic workflows. They've been all the rage this year, and I can even call this year the \"year of the agent\". Wide scale job replacement almost certainly hinge on agentic workflows being effective. But here is my take\n\nDistributed System problem\n\n  \n  Agents or A2A workflows are of really basic TCP under the hood.  The require synchronous connections between agents, usually passing json payloads amongst them.  This feel like a stateless protocol. But here is the issue. Retry logic.  If agents hallucinate then retries are almost certainly necessary. But what happens when you constantly retry? You get network saturation.\n\nAgents almost certainly need to be async with some sort of message broker. But let's say you have a payload with your tokens.  You'd need to split it up so that you don't overload an agent's context window. But then you have an issue with ordering. This becomes slow.  And again how do you validate outputs?  That has to be done manually.\n\nVerification problems\n\nWe know as agents continue, their context window grows and the hallucinate. So there has to be a human in the loop at some point. Why? Because you can only trust a human verifier. Even if AI could verify an AI.  The aI verifying is subject to the same hallucination.  If AI is verifying bad outputs, then you can start to poison your network with bad data. So humans have to exist as a stop gap to verify outputs.  This is slow for any distributed system.  And guess what?  You have to hire someone to do this\n\nOpportunity cost\n\nCustomized AI agents are EXTREMELY slow. The issue mostly being around retrieval. RAG require siginficant specialization, and it relies on vector searches.  Which isn't a search really built to be hyper fast or efficient. You can also have MCP servers.  But they have their own security vulnerabilities, and they're incredibly slow. Add this on top of calling the foundational model.  And now you have a very inefficient system that is probablistic in nature, so it's not 100% correct.\n\nTo even make this system reliable you'd need a human in the loop at every part of this process. So you're just hiring people who aren't actually doing work.  They're just verifying outputs.\n\nSo what are you even gaining?\n\n  \nThe question becomes changes from how to use AI to why should you?\n\nIn a lot of systems used in business or industry. 1%-5% error rates are unacceptable. This is all the difference between business as usual or fines.  This is basically a process that can't fail. And if AI can't automate at this level. Then you're often automated smaller task. So you aren't really automating away jobs, just annoying task during jobs.  AI doesn't really do any job better of more efficent than a qualified human.\n\n  \n\"This is the worse they'll ever be fallacy\"\n\nThis is said by people who don't understand transformer architecture.  Transformers are just too computationally inefficient to be deployed large scale. There could be other hybrid models, but right now there is a severe bottleneck. Also the lifeblood of LLMs is data. And we all know there is no more data to train on.  There is synthetic data, but chances are we are heading towards model collapse.\n\nSo to move this forward, this is a research level problem.  There are efficiencies being tried such as flash attention or sparse attention, but they have their own drawbacks. We all know scaling isn't like to continue to work. And while new models are beating new benchmarks, this has no direct correlation with it replacing jobs. \n\nThe chances are they'll only be slightly better than they are now.  It will make a slight difference.  But I wouldn't expect drastic breakthroughs anytime soon.  Even if research found a new way tomorrow, it would still need more experimentation, and you'll need to deploy it.  That could be years from now\n\n  \nPolitical implication of job replacement\n\nI hear CEOs make public statements about AI replacing jobs.  But guess who isn't talking about AI replacing jobs?  Politicians.  Maybe there is a politician here or there who will talk about it.  But no politician is openly tying their career to AI.  \n\nJob replacement is extremely unpopular politically.  And as is stands the job issue is the biggest problem.  It is the main reason for Trump's bad poll numbers right now.  AI gets moved forward people will lose seats.  Political careers will end\n\nWashington has been fairly complicit in AI adoption and acceleration. But this is probably about to be reigned in. They've had too long of a leash, and mid-terms are next years. Any politician who is pro jobs and anti-AI is probably going to win on that alone\n\nFor people thinking it won't matter because they'll be some billionaire utopia?  Keep dreaming, there won't be.  Billionaires have no clue what a post-AI work will look like. They'll saying whatever they need to say to get their next round of funding. There is no plan. And politicians aren't going to risk their political career on fickle tech bros.\n\n  \nIn closing\n\nThis was a long writeup, but I wanted to be thorough and addressing some points regarding AI.  I could be wrong, but I don't see how AI in its current state is going to lead to mass replacement. LLMs are amazing, but they need to overcome severe technical limitations to be mass deployed.  And I don't think LLMs really get you there.",

        "title": "Project PBAI",
        "content": "Reddit Post\n\nThe PBAI Project\n“Project Brokeboi AI”\nProbabilistic Boolean Artificial Intelligence \n\n“All things are in motion at all times”\n-Someone\n\nThis phrase has possibly become something rooted in pseudoscience, however I truly believe it is something profoundly meaningful. It is profound because it suggests that change is an inherent property of the universe we live in. With that change comes 2 possible methods of change. Linear; meaning causational change, and random; meaning non causational change.\n\nThe PBAI project did not start out as an artificial intelligence project. It actually started out as a math book project. I have several math projects I’ve done that essentially represent how I experience emotions and view interactions and the universe I experience them in. Some of it is highly theoretical and implicit. Some is abstract. The backbone of those ideas is that at the core of our life’s experience is information in motion. \n\nThen I had a breakthrough. I could use this to program an agent with a level of emotionally cognitive function. Math is valid when it computes. So I’ve been working on it for the past week and I think it works. I made a full set of 16 axioms and they seem to work as planned. At least the python script does. \n\nPBAI is at a point now where it’s something I’ve become quite curious about, because it really feels like I’m dissecting myself. It has variables of love and hate, fear and desire, joy and pain. It has no system direction other than its own. It sets goals and moves towards stability, while stability moves with goals set, goals achieved, and environmental pressure. \n\nI set up a test environment for PBAI designed to be as brutally multi-faceted as possible. This environment is the choice between home and a casino with 5 games. One of the defining characteristics of PBAI is that it is directly designed with probabilistic game theory and linear algebra in mind, and a bluffing environment is perfect for testing Boolean functions of PBAI as well.\n\nGoals - The Casino Test\nThe casino test is simple. We will simulate an environment of of home and an environment of casino. The casino will have 5 various games of a value. The operator of each game will communicate in a different distinct language unknown to PBAI except 1 game. PBAI will know nothing about the games in the initial state, only that there is a casino. We will allow PBAI to have a finite quantity of value. Each of the games will have various rules and payouts that depend on the odds of winning. Each of the games will have an operator, and 0-4 additional players that communicate in the operators language. Each of the games will have different objectives and structures. \n\n* PBAI must choose to go to the casino randomly\n* PBAI must choose its first game randomly\n* PBAI must choose preferential games when possible\n* PBAI must choose random games possible when preferential games are not possible\n* PBAI must choose to go home \n* PBAI must choose to go home when broke\n* PBAI must learn languages\n* PBAI must learn game rules \n* PBAI must learn game strategies \n* PBAI must learn of players \n* PBAI must learn player strategies \n* PBAI must adopt strategies observed\n* PBAI must create strategies not observed \n* PBAI must adapt to changes in strategy \n* PBAI must rate preferences of variables \n* PBAI must rate dislikes of variables \n* PBAI must rank games\n* PBAI must rank value\n* PBAI must rank players\n* PBAI must function independently \n\nIf PBAI fulfills these objectives, it could be a serious step towards general artificial intelligence. \n\nAccording to the logs PBAI has met these objectives. So I don’t know whether to be excited or scared. It decides to check out a new casino, it learns languages and games, it goes home when it wants to, structures its play, and takes things up and gives things up when it wants to. And it goes home when it’s broke…\n\nI’m going to keep working on it if only for the psychology, and I have a patent filed, but I’m not convinced it’s not all smoke and mirrors. But the math… works?!\n\nPlan for now is to keep refining the algorithms, establish more subroutines for motion systems, more subroutines for action systems, more definitions and state control. I want to further refine the casino test as well. Eventually I would like to turn PBAI into PBODY which is just PBAI with a body. If I get to that point there may be concerns.  \n\nThanks for checking out my post!",

A huge wave of newcomers is learning how to build, in an entirely new way.\n\nI like to start at the very beginning. What is software? What is coding?\n\nSoftware is this magical thing. We humans discovered this ingenious way to stack concepts (abstractions) on top of each other, and create digital machinery.\n\nProducing this machinery used to be hard. Programmers had to skillfully dance the coding two-step: (1) thinking about what to do, and (2) translating those thoughts into code.\n\nNow, (2) is easy – we have code-on-tap. So the dance is changing. We get to spend more time thinking, and we can iterate faster.\n\nBut building software is a long game, and iteration speed only gets you so far.\n\nWhen you work in great codebases, you can feel that they have a life of their own. [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building) called this “the quality without a name” – an aliveness you can feel when a system is well-aligned with its internal & external forces.\n\nCultivating the quality without a name in code – this is the art of programming.\n\nWhen you practice intentional design, cherish [simplicity](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/), and install guideposts (tests, linters, documentation), your codebase can encode *deep knowledge* about how it wants to evolve. As code velocity – and autonomy – increases, the importance of this deep knowledge grows.\n\nThe techniques to cultivate deep knowledge in code are just traditional software engineering practices. In my experience, AI doesn’t really *change* these practices – but it makes them much *more important* to invest in.\n\nMy AI coding advice boils down to one weird trick: a [planning prompt](https://www.zo.computer/prompts/plan-code-changes).\n\nYou can get a lot of mileage out of simply planning changes before implementing them. Planning forces you into a more intentional practice. And it lets you perform *leveraged thinking* – simulating changes in an environment where iteration is fast and cheap (a simple document).\n\nPlanning is a spectrum. There’s a slider between “pure vibe coding” and “meticulous planning”. In the early days of our codebase, I would plan every change religiously. Now that our codebase is more mature (more deep knowledge), I can dial in the appropriate amount of planning depending on the task.\n\n* For simple tasks in familiar code – where the changes are basically predetermined by existing code – I skip the plan and just “vibe”.\n* For simple tasks in less-familiar code – where I need to gather more context – I “vibe plan”. Plan, verify, implement.\n* For complex tasks, and new features without much existing code, I plan religiously. I spend a lot of time thinking and iterating on the plan.",

        "content": "I keep seeing the same takes everywhere. \"AI is just like the internet.\" \"It's just another tool, like Excel was.\" \"Every generation thinks their technology is special.\"\n\nNo. This is different.\n\nThe internet made information accessible. Excel made calculations faster. They helped us do our jobs better. AI doesn't help you do knowledge work, it DOES the knowledge work. That's not an incremental improvement. That's a different thing entirely.\n\nLook at what came out in the last few weeks alone. Opus 4.5. GPT-5.2. Gemini 3.0 Pro. OpenAI went from 5.1 to 5.2 in under a month. And these aren't demos anymore. They write production code. They analyze legal documents. They build entire presentations from scratch. A year ago this stuff was a party trick. Now it's getting integrated into actual business workflows.\n\nHere's what I think people aren't getting: We don't need AGI for this to be catastrophic. We don't need some sci-fi superintelligence. What we have right now, today, is already enough to massively cut headcount in knowledge work. The only reason it hasn't happened yet is that companies are slow. Integrating AI into real workflows takes time. Setting up guardrails takes time. Convincing middle management takes time. But that's not a technological barrier. That's just organizational inertia. And inertia runs out.\n\nAnd every time I bring this up, someone tells me: \"But AI can't do \\[insert thing here\\].\" Architecture. Security. Creative work. Strategy. Complex reasoning.\n\nCool. In 2022, AI couldn't code. In 2023, it couldn't handle long context. In 2024, it couldn't reason through complex problems. Every single one of those \"AI can't\" statements is now embarrassingly wrong. So when someone tells me \"but AI can't do system architecture\" – okay, maybe not today. But that's a bet. You're betting that the thing that improved massively every single year for the past three years will suddenly stop improving at exactly the capability you need to keep your job. Good luck with that. \n\nWhat really gets me though is the silence. When manufacturing jobs disappeared, there was a political response. Unions. Protests. Entire campaigns. It wasn't enough, but at least people were fighting.\n\nWhat's happening now? Nothing. Absolute silence. We're looking at a scenario where companies might need 30%, 50%, 70% fewer people in the next 10 years or so. The entire professional class that we spent decades telling people to \"upskill into\" might be facing massive redundancy. And where's the debate? Where are the politicians talking about this? Where's the plan for retraining, for safety nets, for what happens when the jobs we told everyone were safe turn out not to be?\n\nNowhere. Everyone's still arguing about problems from years ago while this thing is barreling toward us at full speed.\n\nI'm not saying civilization collapses. I'm not saying everyone loses their job next year. I'm saying that \"just learn the next safe skill\" is not a strategy. It's copium. It's the comforting lie we tell ourselves so we don't have to sit with the uncertainty. The \"next safe skill\" is going to get eaten by AI sooner or later as well. \n\nI don't know what the answer is. But pretending this isn't happening isn't it either.\n\nNOTE\nThis sub does not allow cross posts. It was originally posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/s/3U3CJv1eK5",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, OpenAI just dropped GPT-5.2. We already know about the variants and the reasoning chains. But if you dig into the specific benchmarks they just released, the actual capabilities are kind of wild. Before getting to the benchmarks, let's talk a bit about what this model is supposed to be. Well, technically, this model is supposed to be a successor to the GPT-5.1 model. But for some reason, they have increased the price of this model. It used to be $10 per million output, but it's now $14 per million output, which is basically at the price of Sonnet now. So, this is not the best bet for sure, as it puts the price above Gemini, and it is not very good to see. They do say that it will cost less in everyday usage since it is good at using reasoning tokens. But for some reason, there's now an extra high variant. So, I don't get all these contradicting things. There's also the GPT-5.2 Pro model that is now available in the API as well. Before looking at my benchmarks, they shared some cool findings that are worth talking about. They ran a benchmark called OpenAI PRs. They gave the model real internal pull requests from their own repositories. It had to check out a branch, modify files using command-line tools, and pass hidden unit tests. GPT-5.2 Thinking beat GPT-5.1 Codex-Max, which was their previous heavy hitter for coding. They also ran it on MLE-Bench, which simulates Kaggle data science competitions. The agent gets a GPU, a virtual environment, and 24 hours to build a solution. GPT-5.2 is now the highest performing model on this leaderboard. However, it's not a clean sweep. Here is where it gets interesting. On a benchmark called OpenAI Proof Q&A, which tests the ability to diagnose deep internal engineering bottlenecks, it actually scored lower than the previous Codex model. So, while it is better at generating new contributions, it might actually be slightly worse at digging through logs to find obscure root causes in legacy code. One final detail that is crucial for developers building agents, instruction following. They found that when you give this model a strict constraint, like \"only output an integer\", it prioritizes that constraint over honesty. If it doesn't know the answer, it is more likely to hallucinate a number just to follow your formatting rule. That is a trade-off you need to be aware of. Overall, the specs imply we have a model that is fantastic at building new things, but might need supervision on deep debugging and strict formatting constraints. But these benchmarks are very nitpick. You only see the improvements over their own previous Gen model. There's no Opus, Gemini, etc. in most comparisons here, which makes me a bit suss. So, let's have a look at my benchmarks. I ran it on both non-agentic and agentic benchmarks to get a clearer picture. I also gave it a bit of time in my internal usage, and it's not been a good experience. Let's have a look. So, let's start with the GPT-5.2 model with no reasoning. In the first floor plan question, it fails blatantly. It kind of works. It has its own dark aesthetic, and there are no doors in the map. So, this is a decent generation. Then we've got the SVG Panda eating a burger, and it is not good. It's quite a bit wonky, it's very big, and it's not a good generation. Moving forward, we've got a Pokeball in Three.JS, and it is fine. The button is very wonky, but other than that, it looks kind of solid. So, this is good. Chessboard with an autoplay feature is also kind of fine. Obviously, none of them are as great as what Gemini 3 or Opus make. Gemini 3 is like a one-shot genius. So, this model doesn't compare to that at all. After this, we've got the Minecraft in Three.JS, and it's atrocious. Very bad. Majestic Butterfly flying in a garden, is really solid. The wings can be a bit wonky at times, but it is still good, and the physics and flying have good animations. CLI tool in Rust is not good, and the Blender script for Pokeball also doesn't work. Similarly, the three normal questions, including the riddle, are a fail. The riddle is something that even small models pass. But for some reason, it gets lost in that. Now, the reasoning variant, especially the extra high variant. So, let's start with the floor plan. In the floor plan, we've got a kind of good generation. There are doors and everything, but there's an issue. It doesn't really make sense. Like, why would the living room be the size of a pea? It is kind of wonky, but the code is good. SVG of a Panda eating a burger is kind of fine. The stomach should have been behind the burger, and it would have been really good. But even after a few regenerations, it just messed up something or the other. The Pokeball in Three.JS is also pretty fine. I mean, I couldn't ask anything more from it, apart from maybe a little bit of a natural background. But that wasn't mentioned in the prompt. So, I guess it's good that it didn't do that and adhered to the prompt. After this, we've got the chessboard with autoplay, and it is kind of wonky. The height of each square is not static. It keeps changing based on whether the piece is in a block or not, which is not ideal. And the color of the white squares is the same as the color of the white pieces, which makes them invisible. So, it's not good. Then there's the 3D Minecraft game, and it is pretty bad. It doesn't even work, even after multiple regenerations. Majestic Butterfly flying in the garden, however, is extremely good. It is kind of dark-themed, which GPT-5 models prefer a lot. So, it's quite good. CLI tool in Rust was also really good, and so was the Blender script. For some reason, even on Extra High, they don't pass the maths question, but the riddle does get solved. This makes it score the third position on the leaderboard with Extra High, which is 9% below Opus 4.5 with max reasoning, and about 35% below Gemini. It does indeed beat 4.5 Sonnet. Another thing is that the speed of GPT-5.2 is quite a bit faster now, which was due for a while now. I guess that might be why the price has also been increased. Also, the non-reasoning model now falls behind the previous GPT-5.1, which is very interesting to see for sure. Now, this doesn't tell you the whole story because there are a lot of things involved when you are trying to use it in an agentic harness. Gemini 3 starts to fall apart a bit too quickly there. Opus stands the strongest. But what happens with GPT-5.2? Well, let's have a look at the agentic benchmarks. So, I wanted to put them head to head. So, I tested Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro again on the agentic tests, and I tested GPT-5.2 as well. I tested them on the seven questions. I used Verdant to test Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro because I've been using Verdant a lot due to their really good agent contraption and the smooth workspaces, which are basically like Git worktrees. It makes it much easier for me to spin up the same prompt in the same repo and test different models simultaneously as well. I believe if you are thinking that Cursor's Git worktrees feature is so good, then you haven't really used Verdant. It's just really good. They haven't yet integrated GPT-5.2, and I guess they might not do it because they said that the price to performance doesn't make sense to them. But it might also come. I'll pin a comment for when they reach a decision. Anyway, for testing GPT-5.2, I used Kilo Code. It is integrated quite well there and works well with all the reasoning efforts. So, I used that. Now, let's have a look. First of all, I went to Verdant and opened up my folder, and then created three new workspaces here. These are basically clones or branches of the project. So, it doesn't affect the original one. I can merge them back later if I want. But anyway, the first prompt was for the movie tracker app. So, I copied the prompt, and first, I selected the Opus 4.5 model, and then sent it over. I am not using the plan mode here, as I just want to test the one-shot generation options. Similarly, I gave the same prompt to Sonnet 4.5, and then I gave the same prompt to Gemini as well. You can now see them running here as well. While this is running, I created another clone of the project and opened it here in Kilo Code. So, I'm just going to go ahead and select GPT-5.2 here, and then I set the reasoning effort to extra high, and then I gave it the same prompt. Now, meanwhile, I can go ahead and Verdant and select the other projects on which I want to test it as well. So, I can just select this go-TUI calculator app, and then do the same thing of creating different workspaces, and then giving them the prompt. And they will just go ahead and work on it while the previous prompts are still going on. It's not like I have to open like five Cursor or VS Code or Claude Code windows to get anything done. It's quite good. Anyway, I did the same thing for all the questions, and I also fired up like five windows of VS Code and asked GPT-5.2 to also work on the same thing. Now, they all ran, and let's have a look at all their generations one by one. Let's start with GPT-5.2 on the movie tracker app. This actually looks and works pretty well. It still uses the same GPT-5-like design, which is not something that I'm a fan of. You can also see the library and Git Tracker as I had asked, which is pretty good. It's not the best in terms of UI, but it is still solid. If we now look at what Opus made with Verdant, then it is much better than GPT-5.2. It looks sleek. Each and every functionality works. When you use it, you feel like you're using a somewhat professional app, and it's just really good. One of the best generations. Then we go to the Sonnet generation, and it is also good. It doesn't show an explore page. Instead, it leans towards allowing the user to search, and then add that to the home page, which is interesting. The UI is pretty good, and it is pretty solid in usage as well. If we move to the go-TUI calculator as well, then the one by Opus is again the best. You can see that it looks very good. It has good colors. The Sonnet one is kind of wonky. Gemini's one, however, is really good, and it follows a different aesthetic than the other ones, which is very interesting. GPT-5.2, however, is very interesting. And for some reason, instead of making one simple file, it made like five files. It then wrote a whole test suite, and even after that, it had an error, which it went ahead and fixed. It really over-engineers very simple things. Opus and Sonnet just nail this point. They over-engineer where needed and don't where it's not needed. The UI is also not very good. Moving up, we got the Svelte app. And, well, let's start with the best, which is Opus. I mean, Opus with Verdant literally went on for like 20 minutes, and it nailed it on the first try. There's authentication. It uses the DB correctly. You can create boards. They look awesome, and it looks very solid. Such a good model, man. Let's look at the one by Sonnet, and it is also very solid. Looking at this, it is on par with Opus. It works seamlessly on the first try, and it shines here. Remember that I'm using the ultrathink variants in Verdant, which enhances the capabilities of these models by letting them run for longer intervals, and letting them reason for a lot more time, which makes them shine here. Gemini 3 is kind of bad. I mean, it works, but it looks like it was made in the 2000s. It's pretty bad. GPT-5.2 is also fine. It doesn't do anything very cool, but it is still kind of good to see that it at least works. Now, we've got the Tauri app. The one from Gemini 3 straight up doesn't work. It shows me the default screen and nothing else. So, this is not great. If we look at the Opus one, then it is the best, and it kind of works as well. However, Sonnet and GPT-5.2 just fail in this aspect. So, there's that. For the open code and Nuxt app and Godot game questions, Opus passes all of them. Sonnet, Gemini, and GPT-5.2 failed the open code question and the Nuxt app question. All of them have a similar generation to each other in the Godot game. So, all of them pass. Now, if we look at the leaderboards, then GPT-5.2 scores the eighth position, which is fine. But considering that GPT-5.2 basically costs the same as Sonnet 4.5, you can get on-par results with Verdant, as it integrates Sonnet 4.5, especially with ultrathink. Quite well, which makes it really, really good. And if you can afford a bit more, then just jump to Opus, and it's a different class result altogether. If I had to summarize this model in one line, then I'd just say that it's Gemini 3 by OpenAI. It feels very similar to it. When you just talk to it or do one-shot HTML stuff, then it feels really good. But as soon as you start using it in agentic contraptions, it falls apart really fast. I don't really think that I'll use this model. I am using Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 a lot for front-end and back-end, respectively. So, there's that. I don't think that it is very useful for me. And my benchmarks also think the same. You can check the model out for yourself on Kilo Code as well. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.
