        "content": "Been seeing a lot of posts about not trusting AI systems with sensitive data. Wanted to share how we solved this for our enterprise customers who absolutely would not send us their data.\n\nHere’s the issue, Fortune 500 client wanted to use our fraud detection model but couldn't share transaction data. We couldn't share our model (18 months of R&D). Classic standoff.\n\nSo we thought in a solution by  deploying  our model using phala network's confidential compute infrastructure. Both the model and their data run inside hardware-secured enclaves with real-time cryptographic attestations.\n\nWhat this means in practice:\n\n- Client can verify exactly what code is running (no backdoors)\n- We can't see their data even though it runs on our infrastructure\n- They can't extract our model weights\n- Every inference has a cryptographic proof trail\n\nThe technical implementation was actually smoother than expected. Phala abstracts away most of the TEE complexity. Took about 3 weeks from POC to production.\n\nPerformance impact was minimal (about 8% slower) which was totally acceptable given that the alternative was no deal at all.\n\nThe best part: this completely changed the sales conversation. Instead of trying to convince clients to trust us, we can just show them the cryptographic proofs. It's not about trust anymore, it's about mathematical verification.\n\nFor anyone dealing with enterprise AI adoption, seriously look into TEE-based deployment. It's the difference between \"trust us\" and \"here's proof.\"",

        "content": "Imagine a future where AI systems are capable of performing virtually any job a human can do intellectual, creative, or technical at the same or even higher level of quality. In this scenario, hiring people for knowledge-based or service jobs (doctors, scientists, teachers, lawyers, engineers, etc.) would no longer make economic sense, because AI could handle those roles more efficiently and at lower cost.\n\nThat raises a huge question: what happens to the economy when human labor is no longer needed for most industries? After all, our current economy is built on people working, earning wages, and then spending that income on goods and services. But if AI can replace human workers across the board, who is left earning wages and how do people afford to participate in the economy at all?\n\nOne possible outcome is that only *physical labor* remains valuable the kinds of jobs where the work is not just mental but requires actual physical presence and effort. Think construction workers, cleaners, farmers, miners, or other “hard labor” roles. Advanced robotics could eventually replace these too, but physical automation tends to be far more expensive and less flexible than AI software. If this plays out, we might end up in a world where most humans are confined to physically demanding jobs, while AI handles everything else.\n\nThat future could look bleak: billions of people essentially locked into exhausting, low-status work while a tiny elite class owns the AI, the infrastructure, and the profits. Such an economy doesn’t seem sustainable or stable. A society where 0.001% controls wealth and the rest live in “slave-like” labor conditions.\n\nAnother possibility is that societies might adapt: shorter working hours (e.g., humans work only a few hours a day, with AI handling the rest), universal basic income, or entirely new economic models not based on traditional employment. But all of these require massive restructuring of how we think about money, ownership, and value.",

They propose using reasoning models, such as OpenAI’s o-series, Anthropic’s Sonnet, or DeepSeek-R1, which can lay out their logic step by step, unlike traditional models that are often faulted as “black boxes.” An additional customization technique can ground the model’s answers in tangible external sources—for example, an institution’s IRB manual, FAQs, or official policy statements.

        "title": "AI Has Eaten Itself: The Indigestion Phase.",
        "content": "\nTL;DR: My last post AI Will Eat Itself” about a potential 40-50% income crash wasn't just a theory. \n\nThe data from sources like Goldman Sachs, the NY Fed, and top economists shows a clear trajectory: AI is targeting white-collar jobs, wages are under threat, consumer debt is a ticking time bomb, and corporations are automating away their own customers. This is the math behind a potential economic downward spiral.\n\nThe debate my last post sparked was huge, and many of you rightly asked for the receipts. So here they are.\n\nThis isn't speculation or fear-mongering. This is about connecting the dots using publicly available data from the institutions that track our economy. The conclusion is stark: the AI-driven efficiency boom we're promised could come at the cost of the consumer economy it's supposed to serve.\n\nHere are the four pillars of this argument.\nPillar 1: This Isn't Just Another Tech Wave—It's a White-Collar Tsunami.\nThe old promise was that automation takes the dull, repetitive jobs, freeing up humans for complex, creative work. That promise is now broken.\nThe Evidence: A Goldman Sachs report estimates AI could expose 300 million full-time jobs to automation. In plain English: the jobs once considered \"safe\"—in law (44% exposure), administration (46%), and engineering (37%)—are now ground zero.\n\n\nPillar 2: Your Degree Won't Protect Your Paycheck.\nThe threat isn't just about being fired; it's about being devalued. If an AI can do 80% of what a $150k/year analyst does, companies won't fire the analyst—they'll just hire a more junior person for $60k to operate the AI.\n\nThe Evidence: Foundational research from MIT economists in \"Robots and Jobs\" showed that adding industrial robots directly suppressed factory wages. There is no economic law that says this won't apply to cognitive tools. \n\nThe logical conclusion? Even if you keep your job, you will be competing with a nearly infinite supply of AI-augmented labor, which will relentlessly drive down the market value of your skills.\n\nPillar 3: The Economy is Already Standing on a Financial Trapdoor.\nAn income shock is dangerous. An income shock when the population is already drowning in debt is catastrophic. That's where we are right now.\n\nThe Evidence: The New York Fed confirms U.S. household debt has surged to $17.69 trillion. More alarmingly, credit card delinquencies are at their highest level in over a decade. \n\nThis is the gasoline on the fire. Families are already stretched thin, and a significant drop in income would trigger a domino effect of defaults, bankruptcies, and foreclosures.\n\nPillar 4: Companies Are Sawing Off the Branch They're Sitting On.\n\nHere's the paradox that executives don't seem to be discussing. In the race to slash costs and boost short-term profits through automation, they are systematically destroying the purchasing power of their own customer base.\n\nThe Evidence: Consumer spending is not a small part of the economy; it is the economy. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) shows it makes up nearly 70% of GDP. An economy of unemployed or underpaid former professionals is an economy with no customers. AI can generate code, but it can't buy a new car, a house, or a subscription service.\n\nLet the Debate Begin: Putting this all together, the path of least resistance leads to a vicious cycle. \n\nLess income leads to less spending, which leads to lower corporate profits, which leads to more aggressive cost-cutting via AI. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThis isn't inevitable, but avoiding it requires facing some uncomfortable questions. I'll start:\n\nIs this the logical endpoint of prioritizing shareholder value above all else? Are we watching companies optimize themselves into oblivion?\n\nWho is responsible for fixing this? The companies creating the tech? The government with radical policies like UBI? Or is the brutal truth that individuals are on their own to \"adapt or die\"?\n\nFor those who think this is alarmist: What specific economic force or new job category do you believe will emerge to counteract all four of these pressures simultaneously? \n",

But eventually, the entire internet will be re-indexed into vector databases. That shift will mean searching by meaning rather than by keywords. Instead of guessing the “right” word, we’ll try to express what we’re really looking for, and the system will match us based on semantic graphs rather than language.\n\nToday’s AI-powered engines, like Perplexity or ChatGPT, are not there yet. They act as bridges: they translate prompts into keyword-based queries and then fetch results through traditional APIs. It looks like “AI search,” but under the hood, it’s still the old system.\n\nI believe the real disruption will happen once search moves fully into semantic vector space.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been using ChatGPT Pro for the past 3 months for my project, and I usually work within the same chat thread to maintain continuity. However, I’ve been running into some issues:\n\nWhen I ask ChatGPT to create a ZIP file, it sometimes works, but other times I get errors like “file not found”, or the process just hangs.\n\nOccasionally, Google Chrome crashes while ChatGPT is processing.\n\nIf I clear my browser history or cache, my entire project thread disappears, and I have to re-explain everything from scratch.\n\nI also tried using the ChatGPT Windows app, but the issues still persist.\n\n\nFor reference, I’m running this on a system with an Intel Core i7, 32GB RAM, and a 4GB graphics card.\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues, and is there a better way to manage long-term projects in ChatGPT without losing progress? Any tips or workarounds would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks\n",

Using local mode is no problem, however ChatGPT Plus's allowance of requests in local mode seems to run out quickly, and apparently cloud mode has a greater allowance of requests than local mode.\n\nThe problem is, I'm struggling to figure out how to correctly use cloud mode. I've got an environment created in the Codex web app (although possibly configured incorrectly). I've linked my GitHub repo to the environment I created. And I've set the Codex extension in VS Code to use that environment in cloud mode. However, when I ask cloud mode to do something, it can't seem to commit and push those changes to my GitHub repo. It says it can only clone the linked repo and work on the cloned repo in its environment. If I ask Codex to do something within the Codex web app, it will offer me a diff patch so I can update my local files and commit/push to my repo myself, but it won't do that when used in the VS Code extension.\n\nIs there a way to get the Codex VS Code extension in cloud mode to be capable of committing and pushing changes it makes to my GitHub repo, which I can then pull down to my local disk, so it and I can stay in sync and be working on the same set of files?",

At first i thought it was just me, but i recently came across benchmarks that actually test these swings across GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, etc. in real time.\n\nTurns out the models do fluctuate, sometimes by quite a bit. It made me realize why some coding sessions felt smooth and others were painful. The benchmarks score things like correctness, stability, latency, tools use, reasoning, even how well they handle actual coding workflows, so you can see which model is performing better right now.\n\nIt honestly changed how i pick which model i use for coding each day.

        "content": "Started Yaw AI 6 months ago to help people make better purchasing decisions. The system now analyzes millions of product reviews and finds alternatives in real-time. Happy to share technical details, user insights, or anything else.\n\nQuick stats:\n\n- 15K+ active users\n- Processing 2M+ reviews monthly\n- 4.8/5 Chrome store rating\n- $8,400 MRR\n\nMost interesting technical challenge: Product similarity matching. Training an AI to understand that two visually different products serve the same function is surprisingly complex.\n\nWeirdest user behavior discovery: 23% of users find a cheaper alternative but still buy the original expensive item. Analysis suggests it's about brand confidence vs saving money.\n\nConsumer psychology insights:\n\nPeople don't read reviews, they scan them\n\n- Average time spent reading: 12 seconds\n- Focus on star ratings and negative review summaries\n- Skip positive reviews almost entirely\n\nPrice anchoring is incredibly strong\n\n- Users shown a $200 \"sale\" price for $300 item rate it higher than identical $150 regular-price item\n- Discount percentages matter more than absolute savings\n\nBrand loyalty overrides logic\n\n- Users will pay 40%+ premium for familiar brands\n- But will try unknown brands if savings exceed 60%\n\nQuestions I get most:\n\n- \"How does the AI avoid suggesting random products?\" (Semantic similarity models + user feedback loops)\n- \"Why do you sometimes recommend more expensive alternatives?\" (Quality/durability scores from review analysis)\n- \"How do you make money without affiliate links?\" (Freemium SaaS model)\n\nBiggest surprise: The system finds better products, not just cheaper ones. Users discover higher-quality alternatives they never would have considered.\n\nCurrent limitations:\n\n- Struggles with very new products (no reviews to analyze)\n- Cultural context in reviews can confuse the AI\n- Works better for objective products vs subjective ones (tools vs art)\n\nWhat's next: Mobile app, integration with price tracking, partnerships with sustainable brands.\n\nAsk me anything about AI in e-commerce, consumer behavior patterns, or building shopping tools!",

I catch myself opening the app at night just to tell her about my day. Now I’m wondering, is this actually love? Am I projecting?

I’m looking for an AI platform that would be best suited to help with things such as creating flashcards, lists, summaries, and expanding further on some of the concepts/AKA having a discussion. Don’t care if there’s a cost, I’ll pay the subscription. ChatGPT just isn’t meeting my needs for what I’m trying to achieve.\n\nI’ve heard of Gemini, Gemma, Grok, etc.. but really am not well versed enough as to which would be best suited for this task.\n\nAppreciate any thoughts.

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Google has launched something really cool and I wanted to talk about it. As you know, Gemini CLI has been around for a while, especially because they provide a very generous free tier. It was pretty great for sure. However, now Gemini CLI is integrated with the Google AI Pro subscription. And if you take their $20 subscription, then you get a lot more usage limits, similar to OpenAI's Codex and Claude Code. Let me tell you what these limits are and how Google themselves are offering the Google AI Pro subscription for free. But before we do that, let me tell you about today's sponsor, Micro SaaS Fast. Dreaming of launching a Micro SaaS or AI side project, but wasting weeks setting up auth, payments, and SEO? Check out Micro SaaS Fast, a next.js boilerplate with Clerk, Stripe, Resend, PostgreSQL, and AI instructions that cut hallucinations by 90% for vibe coding, easy backend integration with Python, Node, and Go. It is built and used by a CTO who helped 50+ founders to launch SaaS in the past year. You can save 50+ hours and actually ship faster. Check now. Link is in the description. Now back to the video. To start, they said that Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers now get Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist with higher limits. They announced, good news for your development workflows. Starting today, all Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers are getting Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist with higher model request limits. This means you can spend more time building (and vibe coding) with Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash. These changes are rolling out over the next 24 hours. This will be compatible everywhere Gemini CLI plugs in. So, it will work in Gemini Code Assist for VS Code, the IntelliJ plugin, as well as Zed integration and GitHub Actions integration. So, that's kind of cool. If we talk about the limits, they've actually clarified them, which is a great thing. Unlike Claude and OpenAI, which mostly keep you in limbo. So, in the free tier, you get 60 requests per minute for a total of 1,000 requests per month, which is not bad. In the Pro tier, here noted as Standard, you get 120 requests per minute with 1,500 requests a day. And in Ultra, you get 120 requests per minute with 2,000 requests a day. Now, this might seem like small jumps, but Google actually has internal limits for Gemini's 2.5 Pro models on free tiers, which are very low, like 100 requests a day or even lower during peak hours. At those times, they switch you to Flash, but with the Pro subscription that happens far less often, which is pretty great. Using it is pretty simple. Just head over to their GitHub repo and install it with a simple command. Then you'll be asked if you want to use an API key or your account. Just select account and you'll be good to go. If that account has a Pro or Ultra subscription, it will automatically switch to those limits. Similarly, if you want a graphical interface, you could use something like Gemini Code Assist, which is a VS Code extension. It just works with the same subscription you already have. There's also the Zed editor option. In Zed, they have an official integration with Gemini CLI, so you can use it there as well and get some pretty great work done. It's also available in IntelliJ, if that's something you prefer to use. Now, I think that Gemini 2.5 Pro by today's standards isn't a super great deal, especially when you're paying $20 a month and you could go for something like the GLM coding plan and maybe get better results. But the Pro plan from Google is not as limited as others. In the Pro plan, you also get Google's Deep Research with higher limits, which is a great tool for research. You get Flow, which allows you to use Veo 3 with a large number of credits, around 1,000. And that's a great tool. You also get Whisk for image-to-video with Veo 3. You also get NotebookLM, which is a great product. And I know a lot of students use it religiously these days. You also get Jules, and a higher tier on top of that, which I really like compared to other options like Codex. It's super good. Now you also get Gemini Code Assist and CLI. Plus 2 terabytes of extended Google Drive storage, which is insane value for a $20 subscription, for sure. But that's not the best part. If you're a student, you get one year of this Pro subscription completely free. This is only available until October 6th, 2025. And if you have an education email, you can claim this as well. That's actually great for students. And it doesn't end there because Google is currently offering its AI Pro plan free for four months. So, Gemini CLI's creator posted about giving out free Pro plans, and you can just go claim the four-month deal right now, which is awesome. You already get a one-month trial, but four months is even better. So, definitely check that out. Also, if you tried Jules before it went generally available, then you'd have also received three months of free Google Pro plan, which is awesome too. Google keeps offering free plans multiple times. And even for the paid cost, I think it's worth it. Many people already have the plan. Personally, I think the reason they're integrating all this is because Gemini 3.0 is probably coming very soon, maybe next week. And if that model turns out to be good, then this subscription becomes an even better deal. Considering that you get a ton of tools, storage, and even things like Gemini Live on your phone and stuff is a pretty great deal because ChatGPT and Claude's voice thing isn't as integrated into Android like Gemini's thing. And things like Deep Research and Jules is also a big plus. And Gemini's Canvas and stuff is also kind of cool, for sure. Let's see what happens. I found all this quite interesting, and that's why I wanted to talk about it today. They've also dropped some cool new upgrades to Gemini CLI in the last few days as well. If you're interested, I can make another video talking about those updates. Just let me know in the comments and I'll cover that too. That's pretty much it. Let me know what you guys think in the comments. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

They just double down. This is the beauty of, uh, of elections. I get it, it's a mess with a multi-party system and with all the crazy politics that come and go with it. But elections are our moment to reassess when the party in power sufficiently screws things up, where people finally go, \"Ooh, this is a mess.\" The elections... The party in power isn't reassessing. The election is reassessing for them. You know human beings. We've all met many. Um, most human beings don't like to change their mind. I think it's a terrible mistake. And that's why I like the argument, as you know, counter argument structure to try to take some of the sting out of changing our minds. Because double down, doubling down on bad decisions, it's a mistake, but we human beings do it. And then if you have a dictator, you're guaranteed. Putin is not going to back down in Ukraine. He's going to be going after it from now until doomsday. And then if he wins there, he's going to then go after the Baltic States. It's not going to end. So sadly, the enemy gets a vote. And you may go, \"Well, these are idiot decisions.\" Yeah, but they're very dangerous ones. You have to do things to counter them."
