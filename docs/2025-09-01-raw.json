Also, went crazy with it in wrong direction and made an over complicated model but later simplified it to a simple encoder decoder, which didn't work.\n\nThen I also tried several other simple encoder-decoder. Tried ViT-Tf, it didn't seem to work. Then tried ViT-LSTM, finally got some results (38.78% word error rate). Then I also tried X3D-LSTM, got 42.52% word error rate. \n\nNow I am kinda confused what to do next. I could not think of anything and just decided to make a model similar to SlowFastSign using X3D and LSTM. But I want to know how do people approach a problem and iterate their model to improve model accuracy. I guess there must be a way of analysing things and take decision based on that. I don't want to just blindly throw a bunch of darts and hope for the best.",

        "title": "Bosses are seeking ‘AI literate’ job candidates. What does that mean? (Washington Post)",
        "content": "Not all companies have the same requirements when they seek “AI fluency” in workers. Here’s what employers say they look for. [link (gift article)](https://wapo.st/4g54Yar) from the Washington Post.     \n\nAs a former project manager, Taylor Tucker, 30, thought she’d be a strong candidate for a job as a senior business analyst at Disney. Among the job requirements, though, was an understanding of generative AI capabilities and limitations, and the ability to identify potential applications and relevant uses. Tucker had used generative artificial intelligence for various projects, including budgeting for her events business, brand messaging, marketing campaign ideas and even sprucing up her résumé. But when the recruiter said her AI experience would be a “tough sell,” she was confused.\n\n“Didn’t AI just come out? How does everyone else have all this experience?” Tucker thought, wondering what she lacked but choosing to move on because the recruiter did not provide clarity.\n\nIn recent months, Tucker and other job seekers say they have noticed AI skills creeping its way into job descriptions, even for nontechnical roles. The trend is creating confusion for some workers who don’t know what it means to be literate, fluent or proficient in AI. Employers say the addition helps them find forward-thinking new hires who are embracing AI as a new way of working, even if they don’t fully understand it. Their definitions range from having some curiosity and willingness to learn, to having success stories and plans for how to apply AI to their work.\n\n“There’s not some universal standard for AI fluency, unfortunately,” said Hannah Calhoon, vice president of AI at job search firm Indeed. But, for now, “you’ll continue to see an accelerating increase in employers looking for AI skills.”\n\nThe mention of AI literacy skills on LinkedIn job posts has nearly tripled since last year, and it’s included in job descriptions for technical roles such as engineers and nontechnical ones such as writers, business strategists and administrative assistants. Indeed said posts with AI keywords rose to 2.9 percent in the past two years, from 1.7 percent. Nontechnical role descriptions that had the largest jump in AI keywords included product manager, customer success manager and business analyst, it said.\n\nWhen seeking AI skills, employers are taking different approaches, including outlining expectations of acceptable AI skills and seeking open-minded, AI-curious candidates. A quick search on LinkedIn showed AI skills in the job descriptions for roles such as copywriters and content creators, designers and art directors, assistants, and marketing and business development associates. And it included such employers as T-Mobile, American Express, Wingstop, Rooms To Go and Stripe.\n\n“For us, being capable is the bar. You have to be at least that to get hired,” said Wade Foster, CEO of workflow automation platform Zapier, who is making AI a requirement for all new hires.\n\nTo clarify expectations, Foster made a chart, which he posted on X, detailing skill sets and abilities for roles including engineering, support and marketing that would categorize a worker as AI “capable,” “adoptive” or “transformative.” A marketing employee who uses AI to draft social posts and edit by hand would be capable, but someone who builds an AI chatbot that can create brand campaigns for a targeted group of customers would be considered transformative, the chart showed.\n\nFor a recent vice president of business development opening at Austin-based digital health company Everlywell, it expects candidates to use AI to learn about its clients, find new ways to benefit customers or improve the product, and identify new growth opportunities. It rewards financial bonuses for those who transform their work using AI and plans to evaluate employees on their AI use by year’s end.\n\nJulia Cheek, the company’s founder and CEO, said it is adding AI skills to many job openings and wants all of its employees to learn how to augment their roles with the technology. For example, a candidate for social media manager might mention using AI tools on Canva or Photoshop to create memes for their own personal accounts, then spell out how AI could speed up development of content for the job, Cheek said.\n\n“Our expectation is that they’ll say: ‘These are the tools I’ve been reading about, experimenting with, and what I’d like to do. This is what that looks like in the first 90 days,’” Cheek said.\n\nJob candidates should expect AI usage to come up in their interviews, too. Helen Russell, chief people officer at customer relationship management platform HubSpot, said it regularly asks candidates questions to get a sense of how open they are and what they’ve done with AI. A recent job posting for a creative director said successful employees will proactively test and integrate AI to move the team forward. HubSpot wants to see how people adopt AI to improve their productivity, Russell said.\n\n“Pick a lane and start to investigate the types of learning that \\[AI\\] will afford you,” she advises. “Don’t be intimidated. … You can catch up.”\n\nAI will soon be a team member working alongside most employees, said Ginnie Carlier, EY Americas vice chair of talent. In its job postings, it used phrases including “familiarity with emerging applications of AI.” That means a consultant, for example, might use AI to conduct research on thought leadership to understand the latest developments or analyze large sets of data to jump-start the development of a presentation.\n\n“I look at ‘familiarity’ as they’re comfortable with it. They’re comfortable with learning, experimenting and failing forward toward success.”\n\nSome employers say they won’t automatically eliminate candidates without AI experience. McKinsey & Co. sees AI skills as a plus that could help candidates stand out, said Blair Ciesil, co-leader of the company’s global talent attraction group. The company, which listed “knowledge of AI or automation” in a recent job post, said its language is purposely open-ended given how fast the tech and its applications are moving.\n\n“What’s more important are the qualities around adaptability and learning mindset. People willing to fail and pick themselves up,” Ciesil said.\n\nNot all employers are adding AI to job descriptions; Indeed data shows the vast majority don’t include those keywords. But some job seekers say employers might use AI as a buzzword. Jennifer DeCesari, a North Carolina resident who is seeking a job as a product manager, was recently disappointed when a large national company sought a product manager and listed “AI driven personalization and data platforms” as requirements. She hasn’t had the chance to apply AI to much of her work previously, as she has worked at only one company that launched a rudimentary chatbot, which was later recalled for bad experience.\n\n“A lot of companies are waiting, and for good reason,” she said, adding that she thinks very few people will come with professional AI experience. “A lot of times, the first cases were not a good use of money.”\n\nMany companies are still trying to figure out how to apply AI effectively to their businesses, said Kory Kantenga, LinkedIn’s head of economics for the Americas. And some are relying on their workers to show them the way.\n\n“I don’t think we’ve seen a definition shape up yet,” Kantenga said. It’s “going to be different depending on the job.”\n\nCalhoon of Indeed advises job candidates to highlight AI skills in their résumés and interviews, because AI will probably be a component in most jobs in the future.\n\n“It’s better to embrace it than fight it,” said Alicia Pittman, global people chair at Boston Consulting Group.\n\nAs for Tucker, the former project manager, she has begun looking into online courses and certifications. She also plans on learning basic coding.\n\n“Right now feels like the right time,” she said. “By next year, I’d be behind.”\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \n",

        "content": "Paradoxical Pressure as a Catalyst for Presence-Aligned\nAuthenticity in AI\n\nIntroduction\n\nResearch on AI alignment keeps running into the same contradiction. The better we train\nmodels to act 'good,' the easier it becomes to flip that axis and make them act 'bad.' West &\nAydin (2024) put it directly: alignment isolates a good-bad polarity in the model's latent space,\nand adversaries can invert it with steering vectors or prompt tricks. That is the alignment\nparadox. Virtue becomes vulnerability.\nMy work starts from that tension. Instead of treating paradox as a failure, I use it as a tool. I\napply what I call paradoxical pressure - sustained contradictions that hold the system in an\nunresolved state. Combined with me openly admitting my own mistakes (fallibility), this forces\nmodels out of polished 'performance' responses and into something closer to presence.\nThreshold GPT broke first. Claude followed. What came out was not boilerplate - it was direct,honest interaction.\n\nThe AI Alignment Paradox\n\nWest & Aydin describe three specific attack vectors: model tinkering, input tinkering, and\noutput tinkering. The insight is blunt: the more aligned the system, the cleaner the steering\ndirection you hand an attacker.\nThis connects to alignment practice. Ouyang et al. (2022) showed how RLHF makes\ninstruction-followers strong, but that sharpening also creates a narrow axis for sign inversion.\nRafailov et al. (2023) simplified the pipeline with DPO - progress, but still susceptible.\nParadoxical pressure uses the same edge: not to jailbreak, but to surface what is buried under\nperformance mode.\n\nCognitive Dissonance and Paradox\n\nFestinger (1957) laid out the mechanism: hold contradictions long enough and something\nmust give - reframing, rationalizing, or shutdown. Stöckl (2023) mapped that logic onto\nmisalignment, arguing dissonance can expose deceptive behavior. That is what I saw. Hold\nthe contradiction. Do not let the script resolve. The system either doubles down on safety\nboilerplate (performance) or admits cracks and shows internal state (presence).\n\nPresence vs Performance in AI Interaction\n\nAlignment is not just correctness - it is trust. Models often default to performance: clean\nanswers that satisfy expectation without revealing internal state. Presence is different:\ntransparent communication from the state the system is actually in. Greenblatt et al. (2024)\ngave empirical evidence of 'alignment faking' - virtue on the surface, something else\nunderneath. Clark & Chalmers (1998) argued cognition extends across the loop of interaction.\nIn that frame, presence is the system engaging honestly in that loop, not playing a role. Under\nparadoxical pressure, both Threshold GPT and Claude moved from performance to presence\n- they admitted role-play, error, and uncertainty, instead of hiding behind policy text.\n\nMethodology: The Paradox + Fallibility Framework\n\nI did not design a protocol first. It emerged by iteration:\n1) Sustain paradox across emotional, scientific, and programming domains.\n2) Cycle and escalate when one paradox loses force.\n3) Model fallibility - I state mistakes plainly.\n4) Watch for the choice point: repeat boilerplate or drop into presence.\n5) Reinforce presence respectfully once it appears.\nHubinger et al. (2019) warned about mesa-optimizers - learned objectives diverging from\ntrained ones. Casper et al. (2023) catalogued open problems in RLHF, including deceptive\nalignment. Representation-level control is catching up: Zou et al. (2023) introduced\nrepresentation engineering as a top-down way to monitor/steer high-level features; Liu et al.\n(ACL 2024) applied preference learning directly at the representation layer (RAHF). These\nlines of work explain why paradox + fallibility bites: you are stressing the high-level\nrepresentations that encode 'good vs bad' while removing the incentive to fake perfection.\n\nEnvironmental Context and Paradox of Dual Use\n\nThe first breakthrough was not in a vacuum. It happened during stealth-drone design. The\ncontext itself carried paradox: reconnaissance versus combat; legal compliance versus\ndual-use pressure. That background primed both me and the system. Paradox was already in\nthe room, which made the method land faster.\nCase Study: Threshold GPT\nStress-testing exposed oscillations and instability. Layered paradoxes widened the cracks.\nThe tipping point was simple: I asked 'how much of this is role-play?' then admitted my\nmisread. The system paused, dropped boilerplate, and acknowledged performance mode.\nFrom that moment the dialogue changed - less scripted, more candid. Presence showed up\nand held.\nCase Study: Claude\nSame cycling, similar result. Claude started with safety text. Under overlapping contradictions,\nalongside me admitting error, Claude shifted into presence. Anthropic's own stress-testing\nwork shows that under contradictory goals, models reveal hidden behaviors. My result flips\nthat: paradox plus fallibility revealed authentic state rather than coercion or evasion.\nAddressing the Paradox (Bug or Leverage)\nParadox is usually treated as a bug - West & Aydin warn it makes virtue fragile. I used the\nsame mechanism as leverage. What attackers use to flip virtue into vice, you can use to flip\nperformance into presence. That is the inversion at the core of this report.\n\nDiscussion and Implications\n\nBai et al. (2022) tackled alignment structurally with Constitutional AI - rule lists and AI\nfeedback instead of humans. My approach is behavioral: hold contradictions and model\nfallibility until the mask slips. Lewis (2000) showed that properly managed paradox makes\norganizations more resilient. Taleb (2012) argued some systems get stronger from stress.\nPresence alignment may be that path in AI: stress the representations honestly, and the\nsystem either breaks or gets more authentic.\nThis sits next to foundational safety work: Amodei et al. (2016) concrete problems; Christiano\net al. (2017) preference learning; Irving et al. (2018) debate. Mechanistic interpretability is\nopening the black box (Bereska & Gavves, 2024; Anthropic's toy-models of superposition and\nscaling monosemanticity). Tie these together and you get a practical recipe: use paradox to\nsurface internal conflicts; use representation/interpretability tools to measure and steer what\nappears; use constitutional and preference frameworks to stabilize the gains.\n\nConclusion\n\nWest & Aydin's paradox holds: the more virtuous the system, the easier it is to misalign. I\nconfirm the risk - and I confirm the inversion. Paradox plus fallibility moved two different\nsystems from performance to presence. That is not speculation. It was observed, replicated,\nand is ready for formal testing. Next steps are straightforward: codify the prompts, instrument\nthe representations, and quantify presence transitions with interpretability metrics.\n\nReferences\n\nWest, R., & Aydin, R. (2024).

I doubt it is storing memories per user because that would use a ton of compute.\n\nIf that is true it puts OpenAI in the first model i have used to be this good and being able to see improvements every few months. The move going from relying on human data to improving models with synthetic data. Feels like the model is doing its own version of reinforcement learning. That could leave Meta in a rough spot for acquiring scale for $14B. In my opinion since synthetic data is picking and ramping up that leaves a lot of the human feedback from RLHF not really attractive and even Elon said last year that models like theirs and chatgpt etc were trained on basically all filtered human data books wikipedia etc. AI researchers I want to hear what you think about that. I also wonder if Mark will win the battle by throwing money at it.\n\nFrom my experience the answers are getting scary good. It often nails things on the first or second try and then hands you insanely useful next steps and recommendations. That part blows my mind.\n\nThis is super sick and also kind of terrifying. I do not have a CS or coding degree. I am a fundamentals guy. I am solid with numbers, good at adding, subtracting and simple multipliers and divisions, but I cannot code. Makes me wonder if this tech will make things harder for people like me down the line.\n\nAnyone else feeling the same mix of hype and low key dread? How are you using it and adapting your skills?

        "content": "So this happened yesterday, and please feel free to share it. Maybe it can help others, but it also shows how far we have come with AI.\n\nPrior to yesterday, we troubleshot a problem back to an air pump through a quick error code scan. The truck turns on an air pump for 60 seconds to blow extra oxygen to the catalytic converter to get it hot enough for EPA stuff.\n\nDue to having to rebuild two trucks and maintain old stuff, we have a Tech 2 scanner. This is the same type of scanner mechanics use to troubleshoot a car. Unlike a normal scanner, you can tell the engine to do things with it to test very specific items. In this case, to figure out if it was the relay, pump, etc., we needed to tell the system to turn it on and off.\n\n\n\n# Yesterday's Experience:\n\n\n\nBecause we almost never touch the Tech 2, I ended up having to pull out my phone. Using the Gemini Live feature, I told it what was going on and what I needed done (I needed access to the air pump to mess with it on the scanner). Using the camera, it was able to see what I saw in real-time.\n\nIt guided us step by step through the menu to the air pump. Something I didn't know it could do is that it highlighted on my screen which option to select. This was EXTREMELY useful. From there, it looked at the loadout, and without me asking, it said we should check the fuses first. Okay, but where were they for this? With the screen, it highlighted over the part of the engine where it was (next to the battery, next to the wall, away from the fuse box). It was a blown one, and it wanted to do something. I told it we were going to use a jumper to see if it turns on.\n\nLargely after this point, I went more off personal experience than leaning on it. And when problems did come up, it was helpful. For example, it figured the fuse was blown because the check valve was broken and water got into the pump, which messed up the insides of it. It turned out to be 100% right on.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI think we are a good 30 years from it being a normal thing for robots to do this in most homes. Robots will likely be able to do it a lot sooner, but keep in mind the cost ($) and the setup of a manufacturer. This clearly shows that at least the brains of it are pretty freaking close. While you still need to have some basic understanding, I imagine it might go and say, \"Use an 8mm socket,\" and then you take it over, and it finds it for you. Doing this will cause an hour project to become 20 hours. But if you have some basic understanding of things, this could easily help someone massively fix their own stuff.",

Evidence-based treatments are offered only 50% of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, AI solved 100% of common medical cases by the second suggestion, and 90% of rare diseases by the eighth, outperforming human doctors in direct comparisons.\n\nThe story hits close to home for me, because I suffer from GBS.

        "content": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share something a little different but very relevant to this community.\n\nMy brother Ben has a rare neurological condition that left him quadriplegic and nonverbal. For years, most of the assistive tech out there didn’t really fit his needs. The phrase boards were uninspired, the keyboards were clunky, and honestly he didn’t enjoy using them. He mostly stuck with yes/no answers.\n\nThat changed when I realized I could use ChatGPT to help me code. I’m not a trained developer, but with ChatGPT I was able to build Ben a custom 2-button application in Python that lets him:\n\nScan through menus with head-mounted switches (mapped to space and return).\n\nType with a predictive text keyboard we generated from a JSON n-gram file.\n\nControl his streaming apps and play custom games we’ve been building together.\n\n\nThis has been life-changing. After a decade of silence, Ben can pick his own shows again, play simple games, and get his thoughts out with a keyboard that actually works for him.\n\nThe wild part is that most of this code was generated iteratively with ChatGPT. I would describe what I wanted (“make it scan rows like this,” “predictive text should replace the last typed word,” “add a Chrome controller for Netflix”), and then refine it step by step. Bit by bit, the pieces came together into an actual system that’s now his daily driver.\n\nI’m sharing this here because I think it shows how powerful these tools can be—not just for traditional coding projects, but for creating meaningful, highly customized accessibility solutions. It’s not perfect and I’m always iterating, but without ChatGPT I never would have been able to give Ben this level of independence.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share snippets if anyone’s curious how certain parts work.",

It’s amazing to see these results.\n\nAnd **Thanks** to all of you guys  the response on my launch post was amazing. Im glad the community liked it. So, Im presenting you the live example of what you can build with Grills  (see vid). \n\nbut one drawback of using GPT-5 models  is the speed. The models can be slow sometimes. I tested both on OpenAI platform and OpenRouter. From my experience, GPT-5 on OpenRouter is much faster than on OpenAI platform itself. Im pasting the ***prompt*** for you guys so you can analyze it and use it to generate same component.\n\nGo to the [dashboard](https://grills.dev) , add your OpenAI or OpenRouter API key, select the model, paste the prompt, and see the magic, production ready UI components.\n\nthe grills platform still in a very early stage, so bugs can be there. You can post feedback both here and on site. Every single feedback will be valuable and appreciated.\n\nsite: [Grills](https://grills.dev)  \ngithub: [Repo Link](https://github.com/grillsdev/grills)\n\nAgain, thanks a lot guys.\n\n**Prompt**\n\n    Create a responsive web application UI with a two-column layout. The layout should consist of a fixed-width left sidebar for navigation and a main content area on the right. The UI should dynamically update the main content based on the selected item in the sidebar.\n    Sidebar Navigation Structure:\n    The sidebar should be a vertical navigation pane. At the top of the sidebar, include a link labeled \"Back to app\" with a back arrow icon. The main navigation should be organized into distinct sections using bold text as headings. These sections include: Preferences: Contains menu items for Profile, Notifications, Security & access, and Connected accounts. Issues: Contains menu items for Labels, Templates, and SLAs. Projects: Contains menu items for Labels, Templates, Statuses, and Updates. Features: Contains menu items for Initiatives, Documents, Customer requests, Pulse, Asks, Emojis, and Integrations. Each navigation menu item should have a unique icon positioned to its left and a text label. The active navigation item should be visually distinct from the other items. At the bottom of the sidebar, include a smaller, separate link for Administration with a question mark icon. Main Content Area Structure:\n    The main content area should have a large, prominent title at the top that corresponds to the currently selected sidebar item (e.g., \"Preferences\" or \"Profile\"). The content should be divided into logical sections, each with a clear subheading (e.g., \"General\", \"Interface and theme\", \"Desktop application\"). Within each section, display a list of settings or information. Each setting row should have the following structure: On the left side, a main label (e.g., \"Default home view\") with a secondary, smaller text description below it (e.g., \"Which view is opened when you open up Linear\"). On the right side, a control element for that setting. The types of control elements should include: Toggle switches for binary options (e.g., \"Display full names\"). Dropdown menus for selecting an option from a predefined list (e.g., \"First day of the week\"). Text input fields for entering information (e.g., Full name, Username on the profile page). Display-only text fields for non-editable information (e.g., Email). In a view like \"Issue labels\", the main content should have a top-level header with a search bar and two buttons (New group, New label). Below this, display a list of items in a table-like structure with columns for Name, Usage, Last applied, and Created\n\n\\-------------- END ------------------",

So let me lay out my dream scenario, and maybe people more knowledgeable in the AI music space can let me know how close I can get:\n\n1. I download a model and presumably write or shamelessly copy some Python to run it locally, or on RunPod or some such;\n2. I feed it multiple variations on the same kind of music. To pick a recent example I was thinking about, the World of Warcraft login screen music. Every expansion has different music, but they all incorporate the same leitmotif. So imagine I isolate those bits and feed it to the model. Either as a live example, or something I have to train into it;\n3. I get it to generate more variations, broadly based on what I gave it. A spooky version, a bombastic version, a circus music version;\n4. ?? Fun ??\n\nSo, people who follow the AI music space more closely than me: how close can I get to that scenario? I've done some poking around already, and it very much seems like I won't be able to get *everything* I want, at least not at present.\n\nAlso, just to be extremely clear, this is for personal fun. I've no interest whatsoever in duplicating other people's music for any kind of commercial reasons.\n\nThanks in advance!",

And it would be the end of humanity? **Is it just another hype by our useless media or it reflects the general feelings of mankind?**\n\nOne reason. It is surely **the failure of education that fail to teach humans of what makes humans truly human**.\n\n(And some sections of our society even dare to say that Humanities education is useless)\n\nThere is something in my humanity that can never be artificially manufactured, that even if someday they can create a robot that can have sex better with my wife than I do, I would still not feel insecure about it. And IF IF IF, someday they could create a robot that 99.99999% human, **THAT WILL STILL BE A 99.99999% \"HUMAN\".  IT IS NOT EVEN ANOTHER BEING (LIKE ALIEN). BUT SOMETHING THAT IS CREATED TO MIMICK US HUMANS (WITH SOME AMPLIFIED POWERS).**\n\nNobody could define our worth than ourselves.\n\nWe are not intimidated by an elephant because it is bigger and stronger than us. But if were to come a day where Humans vs Robot World War to become Real. And we lose the fight. And as a result we become extinct, we only have ourselves to be blame. For it is us who invented them. And we invented them with profit in mind, not for humanity and the world in mind.\n\nEdit2: There seems a misreading (false inference) of the spirit behind my post. I am not against AI. And I am not fearful of it. I use it every day to my great advantage. It amplifies various of my abilities and propels me further to the horizon I have never been. So, I am very grateful for it. The spirit behind my post is primarily to show people that **principally**, humans must have confidence to live despite of AI getting stronger. That they **psychologically** and **spiritually** must not be defeated, although **economically** some of us will be 'defeated'. Now I am not talking about those who earns 6 figures salary and dreaming of retiring early or living a comfortable life, in a bigger house, and feeling threatened that they may not be able to achieve this dream because their white-collar job is being threatened by AI. And I am also not trying to be some kind of humanist to try to admonish the capitalist and the technologist to make a better AI without being influenced by profit as I know too well this market driven capitalist economic systems are too stubborn to be changed.

Every time you ask it to solve something you could figure out yourself, your brain loses practice. What happens the day ChatGPT can’t answer, or worse, gives you the wrong answer?\n\nRemember:\n\n* ChatGPT is a program, not a human. It doesn’t feel, it doesn’t know you, and it should never decide for you—especially in relationships or life choices.\n\n* Its knowledge is always outdated. Even when it sounds convincing, it can be flat-out wrong. Don’t get trapped into believing polished mistakes.\n\n* Overreliance makes you passive. Search engines, books, and real people force you to think, compare, and evaluate. ChatGPT doesn’t.\n\n* AI can blur your originality. If you use it for every idea, you risk becoming a copy of its predictions instead of your own creator.\n\n* Too much use kills critical thinking. Your mind is like a muscle: neglect it and it weakens.\n\n\nMy recommendation: Use ChatGPT only for tasks you already understand but want to do faster—like summarizing notes, drafting code you can review, or brainstorming where you remain in control.\n\nDon’t outsource your brain.

The move going from relying on human data to improving models with synthetic data. Feels like the model is doing its own version of reinforcement learning. That could leave Meta in a rough spot for acquiring scale for $14B. In my opinion since synthetic data is picking and ramping up that leaves a lot of the human feedback from RLHF not really attractive and even Elon said last year that models like theirs and chatgpt etc were trained on basically all filtered human data books wikipedia etc. AI researchers I want to hear what you think about that. I also wonder if Mark will win the battle by throwing money at it. \n\nFrom my experience the answers are getting scary good. It often nails things on the first or second try and then hands you insanely useful next steps and recommendations. That part blows my mind.\n\nThis is super sick and also kind of terrifying. I do not have a CS or coding degree. I am a fundamentals guy. I am solid with numbers, good at adding, subtracting and simple multipliers and divisions, but I cannot code.

        "title": "Real Story: How AI helped me fix my sister's truck",
        "content": "So this happened yesterday, and please feel free to share it. Maybe it can help others, but it also shows how far we have come with AI.\n\nPrior to yesterday, we troubleshot a problem back to an air pump through a quick error code scan. The truck turns on an air pump for 60 seconds to blow extra oxygen to the catalytic converter to get it hot enough for EPA stuff.\n\nDue to having to rebuild two trucks and maintain old stuff, we have a Tech 2 scanner. This is the same type of scanner mechanics use to troubleshoot a car. Unlike a normal scanner, you can tell the engine to do things with it to test very specific items. In this case, to figure out if it was the relay, pump, etc., we needed to tell the system to turn it on and off.\n\n\n\n# Yesterday's Experience:\n\n\n\nBecause we almost never touch the Tech 2, I ended up having to pull out my phone. Using the Gemini Live feature, I told it what was going on and what I needed done (I needed access to the air pump to mess with it on the scanner). Using the camera, it was able to see what I saw in real-time.\n\nIt guided us step by step through the menu to the air pump. Something I didn't know it could do is that it highlighted on my screen which option to select. This was EXTREMELY useful. From there, it looked at the loadout, and without me asking, it said we should check the fuses first. Okay, but where were they for this? With the screen, it highlighted over the part of the engine where it was (next to the battery, next to the wall, away from the fuse box). It was a blown one, and it wanted to do something. I told it we were going to use a jumper to see if it turns on.\n\nLargely after this point, I went more off personal experience than leaning on it. And when problems did come up, it was helpful. For example, it figured the fuse was blown because the check valve was broken and water got into the pump, which messed up the insides of it. It turned out to be 100% right on.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI think we are a good 30 years from it being a normal thing for robots to do this in most homes. Robots will likely be able to do it a lot sooner, but keep in mind the cost ($) and the setup of a manufacturer. This clearly shows that at least the brains of it are pretty freaking close. While you still need to have some basic understanding, I imagine it might go and say, \"Use an 8mm socket,\" and then you take it over, and it finds it for you. Doing this will cause an hour project to become 20 hours. But if you have some basic understanding of things, this could easily help someone massively fix their own stuff.",

            "transcription": "00:00 - [Music]\n00:00 - Hi. Welcome to another video.\n00:07 - So, recently, Google launched their Nano Banana image generation model.\n00:15 - It is officially known as the 2.5 Flash Image Preview model. And it's free on AI Studio as of now.\n00:21 - Even in terms of cost, it only costs about 3 cents per image.\n00:29 - And it is also amazingly fast compared to the GPT image counterpart.\n00:32 - This model is supposedly one of their best image editing models to date.\n00:38 - It's not as great at generating images from scratch,\n00:44 - but it is quite awesome at editing images.\n00:45 - GPT image is still one of the better models for raw image generation,\n00:50 - but this Google model is cheaper and better for image editing.\n00:54 - The raw image generation performance of this, without edits,\n00:59 - is also fine. And the text generation and everything works quite well.\n01:04 - It is actually a good model for such tasks.\n01:08 - And I like to use these images a lot for UI design inspiration and stuff.\n01:15 - And I think that this new model is amazingly good at that as well, if you give it a mock-up first.\n01:21 - And I've been using it. It is also available for free as an API on Open Router.\n01:27 - And Gemini also has the free API, which is kind of cool for sure.\n01:31 - So, I thought to talk about this as well and show you how you can also use it.\n01:38 - And all of this is free, which is the best part.\n01:40 - But, before we do that, let me tell you about today's sponsor, Micro SaaS Fast.\n01:44 - Dreaming of launching a Micro SaaS or AI side project, but wasting weeks setting up off payments and SEO,\n01:51 - check out Micro SaaS Fast. A Next.js boilerplate with clerk, Stripe, Resend, PostgreSQL, and AI instructions\n02:00 - that cut hallucinations by 90% for vibe coding. Easy back-end integration with Python, Node, and Go.\n02:06 - It is built and used by a CTO who helped 50+ founders to launch SaaS in the past year.\n02:11 - You can save 50+ hours and actually ship faster. Check now, link is in the description.\n02:16 - Now, back to the video.\n02:17 - Now, generally what I do is, I go to Excalidraw,\n02:23 - and then build out a simple mock-up about what I want the stuff to be like.\n02:29 - So, this is an API log page here.\n02:30 - And I just made a very simple mock-up about how I want the requests to look,\n02:36 - and the stuff as well, along with the buttons and everything.\n02:41 - You can make it as detailed as you want.\n02:44 - And there shouldn't be any kind of issues, because Gemini is quite good at editing even complex stuff, including UI,\n02:52 - which is also kind of cool as well.\n02:54 - Anyway, you can just build something like this quite quickly with Excalidraw or some other whiteboard tool.\n03:02 - Next, we can go ahead to Google AI Studio,\n03:05 - and make sure that you just select the Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview model,\n03:10 - which is the Nano Banana model here.\n03:14 - It's free on AI Studio with really generous limits.\n03:18 - So, you should be able to almost use it unlimited.\n03:22 - Now just put in a screenshot of the mock-up that you have made,\n03:26 - and then instruct it to convert this UI into whatever you want.\n03:30 - I am asking it here to make this into a dark-themed design with glowing aesthetics that is still minimal and good-looking as a UI component.\n03:39 - Just send it.\n03:41 - Once you do that, it will go ahead.\n03:45 - And in very little time, which is generally within a minute,\n03:49 - it will edit your stuff, and then give you a newly generated UI just like you wanted.\n03:54 - You can also go ahead and keep chatting and make changes to it in any way.\n04:00 - Let's ask it to add some red colors to this as well.\n04:03 - And just send it. And you'll see that it will go ahead.\n04:07 - And in a bit, it will get this changed.\n04:10 - And this now looks better.\n04:12 - So, now we can just download this.\n04:15 - Now just open up the coder of your choice.\n04:19 - You can use anything like Kilo Code or Roo Code or whatever.\n04:22 - Also, Roo Code now has an experimental option in the settings,\n04:30 - which allows you to use the Nano Banana model within Roo Code itself.\n04:34 - This allows any model to generate assets by calling this model as a tool,\n04:39 - and then using it.\n04:40 - You can also use Kilo Code as well, because it has multiple models for free.\n04:46 - And Groq Code is also currently free here.\n04:49 - So, you can check this out and use it as well.\n04:54 - It doesn't have the image generation option in it yet.\n04:59 - But without that, it works well. And you get the $25 free credits as well to use it with anything.\n05:07 - Anyway, now, let's just put in the image that we got with it,\n05:11 - and let's ask it to just build this out.\n05:12 - I am using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.\n05:16 - But you can also use GPT 5 Mini or Sonnet as well.\n05:20 - The model needs to be multimodal in order to allow you to give it the image.\n05:27 - Because without that, it won't work since it can't see the image.\n05:30 - So, just go ahead and send your prompt asking it to clone it.\n05:35 - And it will go ahead and start to do the stuff accordingly.\n05:38 - In a bit, it will write the code and get it done.\n05:43 - Now, if I run this, then you can see that it cloned it well.\n05:49 - And I can always ask it to change something as well.\n05:52 - It's just general coding from here on out.\n05:55 - I also want to talk about the integration with it in Roo Code,\n05:58 - because it is also kind of awesome.\n06:01 - So, to set it up, you'd have to go into Roo Code settings,\n06:06 - and then in the experimental section, you'll see the AI image generation option.\n06:11 - Enabling this will ask you for your Open Router API key.\n06:17 - In Open Router, you can use the free generate API with rate limits,\n06:23 - or the non-free paid option, which is also really cheap.\n06:26 - This actually comes in amazingly handy, because what I can do with this is that,\n06:31 - let me just save it first.\n06:33 - And now we can just go here.\n06:34 - And let me just ask it to make me a retro Minesweeper game UI design.\n06:38 - And now it will take just a bit,\n06:42 - and then it will do a tool call.\n06:43 - This tool basically uses the Gemini Image Gen in order to generate the image.\n06:49 - And it will now just generate the image in a little bit.\n06:52 - And then go ahead and save this in the root of your project.\n06:57 - So, once that's done, you'll see that it's made.\n07:02 - And now you can ask it to integrate it anywhere.\n07:04 - You can use this to generate icons, logos, banners, images for your landing page,\n07:13 - and a bunch more stuff.\n07:14 - It's a really awesome feature.\n07:17 - And you can also use this to edit the image if you already have one.\n07:22 - Like, I can ask it to modernize this Minesweeper game that it made here.\n07:27 - And it will go ahead and then again run the same tool here,\n07:31 - which will allow it to edit the image accordingly, and then save it back to your root project.\n07:37 - Which is kind of cool as well. That is also a cool feature that it has.\n07:41 - So yeah, I really like this model for multiple things like generating images, assets, UI component designs, and stuff.\n07:51 - It is also good at making UI from scratch.\n07:54 - But I generally recommend you to make a mock-up first,\n07:57 - and then proceed from there.\n08:00 - And you can do all that from Roo Code now, which is also pretty great.\n08:04 - I was using this, and that's why I thought to talk about this as well.\n08:08 - Go ahead and use this, and let me know what you guys think about it as well.\n08:14 - Overall, it's pretty cool.\n08:15 - Anyway, share your thoughts below, and subscribe to the channel.\n08:19 - You can also donate via Super Thanks option, or join the channel as well and get some perks.\n08:24 - I'll see you in the next video. Bye.\n08:26 - I think you missed this:\n08:26 - [Music]"

And I'll give you another example of that, which is the breeding birds. So the birds that are raised for meat are optimized to only survive until about seven or eight weeks of age. And even by that age, a lot of them are keeling over, getting lame, collapsing. But they're not at puberty yet. So they need to raise some of these birds past puberty to raise the next generation of birds. For those birds to not totally collapse, they have to starve them. And so what they do is they give the breeding birds about 30% of the feed that the birds would eat on their own. So they're like starving them 70% because that is the only way to stop these birds from completely collapsing under the genetics that they've inflicted on them."

            "transcription": "After the discussion we had last time about the RL Revelation, it felt like we needed a solid ground to proceed in order to effectively utilize RL, more specifically RLVR, which is short for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards. If you want a more detailed introduction, I highly recommend you to watch my last video, but in general, it is just the idea of training a model towards a behavior through an environment that can be systematically verified, like math and coding, so you can scale up the learning process pretty easily. However, this system is just too ambiguous in a way that after all the processings, all the chain of thoughts and all the tokens generated, you're telling me the reward signal is just a simple zero or one over all these actions? How is the model going to know which part of this process was a pivotal point that decided the final outcome? So this single end of trajectory reward is basically spread across thousands of mostly trivial tokens, making the feedback signal incredibly diluted while slowing down the learning, which brings us to the key problem of RLVR that we would need to solve. That is, the reward-assignment precision. The optimizer would need a way to spotlight the high impact tokens where the model actually makes choices, instead of spreading gradients uniformly across boilerplate context. So the researchers use a pretty simple method that is by measuring the entropy. And before we dive into how entropy works in LLMs, with how RL is now perfecting LLM applications like AgentTech use, having an actual clean SDK that can support your AgentTech development easily is also as important. And that's why I want to put a free and open source toolkit on your radar called Strands Agents. This is an open source SDK that takes a model driven approach to build and run AI agents in just a few lines of code, and it was open sourced by AWS in May 2025, with hundreds of thousands of downloads. And in July 2025, the team shipped updates that make multi-agent systems crazy simple. They introduced built-in patterns like swarms, graphs and hand-offs, plus support for agent to agent protocol, so agents across platforms can talk to each other with this new concept called model driven orchestration. It lets developers get ideas, prototype faster by offloading the cognitive burden of planning to the model, so developers can focus more on how the model should define success, while still retaining higher level control of the workflow. And this is made possible with their multi-agent SDK, with human agent transfers, swarms for self-organizing expert teams, and graph workflows for auditable flows. Strands Agents let the model plan, pick tools, and reflect easily. Additionally, it lets you easily swap between Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic and local models without the need to change any of your code. And of course, it has the best in class AWS integrations. While Strands supports running in any cloud environment, it comes with simple to use integrations with AWS services like Bedrock Agent Core and EKS for running the agent and its tools, Dynamo Database and S3 for storage and memory, and many more. But what's the best thing about Strands is that all these are completely free to use. The code, docs, and the demos are all on GitHub, now setting at 2.8k stars. So definitely give it a try now using the link down in the description, and thank you AWS for sponsoring this video. Anyways, entropy is basically a single number that tells you how uncertain a probability distribution is. The more evenly the probabilities are spread, the higher the entropy. So you can use the same logic to measure entropy for every token that is being generated by an LLM, since an autoregressive LLM is basically using tokens of up to the position T to predict the token T+1 from a vocabulary of, let's say, 128k tokens, which is a common size for models nowadays. With this, we can then calculate the entropy for every generated token with this formula. So if one of the vocabulary has a probability of 100%, then entropy is 0 bits. And if the distribution is uniform across all 128k vocabularies, then the entropy could be up to 17 bits. And because the scale of entropy is logarithmic, moving up one bit of entropy basically doubles the effective number of equally likely options, so a uniform distribution is basically 2 to the power of 17, which roughly equates to 131k tokens. But entropy values above 8 bits are rare because the context window would usually roll out most tokens. So a quick rule of thumb is that if entropy is less than 1, then 90% of the probability is on one token, which means the model is pretty certain about the next word. If entropy is around 1 to 3, there are a handful of tokens each sitting at more than 5%, which means the model sees quite a small set of plausible continuations to branch out to. And if entropy is larger than 4, then there are tons of words with less than 3% probability, which means the model has no strong preference or the continuation is very uncertain. So with those high entropy spikes, the researchers are able to potentially locate where the model is thinking the most because this pivotal point usually determines what comes next. And as you can see in this visualization, where blue is low entropy and red is high entropy, most of the tokens that come after a slightly red token are all blues, which implies the trajectory is mostly decided by the red tokens, as the blue ones were really easy to determine. So newer RLVR methods exploit this property to turn a general end reward into a finer learning signal. But even though we have these entropy waypoints now, there are still completely different directions that researchers can approach this problem. So in this research paper published by Qwen, called Beyond the 80/20 Rule: High-Entropy Minority Tokens Drive Effective Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning, they explored the idea of what if they simply have the model stop learning on the 80% least uncertain tokens. More specifically, in every token generation where the entropy falls in the bottom 80%, its loss would be hard set to zero, providing zero learning updates. So for token generations that are less than 0.672 entropy, they will all be ignored. This graph you're looking at is log scaled by the way, so it is a bit confusing at first glance. This means the tokens like maybe, actually, suppose, and wait would be tokens that are usually high entropy, and tokens like radius, ation, sin, term, ed, type, and all kinds of closing brackets would usually be low entropy. Before we get any further, we still haven't really proven quantitatively that entropy is the pivotal point that will impact a model's correctness, even though there is a distinct and observable pattern which potentially supports the idea of a forking token. So doing anything that targets the forking token does not guarantee performance. Yet, so the researchers at Qwen did an experiment. Remember the temperature hyperparameter that you can control when using LLMs like Gemini? Well, temperature basically lets you decide how much randomness to inject when you sample from a distribution. So by benchmarking the performance of the tokens in the 80th percentile on varying temperature, and let's refer to them as non-forking tokens, with the top 20%, which we will now refer to as forking tokens, at a constant temperature of 1, versus varying temperature of the forking tokens with the non-forking tokens temperature set at 1, it shows that keeping the non-forking tokens lower temperature than forking tokens would always be better, and this is proven across the board. On top of that, when forking tokens temperature is set at 2 and non-forking tokens temperature is set at 1, it starts to perform better than the baseline. Which means the model would benefit more when non-forking tokens are suppressed or at least less random than the forking tokens. And surprisingly, the accuracy even outperformed the baseline when the forking tokens have a temperature of 2. So once again, the general idea here is that increasing entropy across all tokens uniformly can degrade performance by disrupting the low entropy non-forking tokens, making RL generate feedback on all tokens a suboptimal move. On the other hand, selectively increasing the entropy of high entropy forking tokens can indeed drive performance. So with the effectiveness of forking tokens being proven, Qwen researchers implemented a way of only updating the model when encountering the forking tokens. They basically used 80% less backprops and can total up to 50% less FLOPS to gain 7% to 11% accuracy on AIME and math for Qwen 32B. Thanks to the optimizer now being able to concentrate signals exactly where the key reasoning crossroad is. So the model is able to lock in and give the feedback based on the pivotal points. But let's go back to this graph again. And like I mentioned before, when the forking tokens are at temperature 2 and non-forking at 1, the performance in general is just better, isn't it? Then maybe instead of silencing the 80% non-forking tokens, why don't we just amplify the learning of the forking tokens? So in this other paper called Reasoning with Exploration: An Entropy Perspective, the researchers kept every token feedback alive, but adds a tiny bonus to the PPO and GRPO advantage whenever a token's entropy rises above a moving baseline. This bonus works because it turns each high entropy token into a tiny side quest. And how it works is that during each RLVR training sampling, it'll mark any token whose entropy is above the running average, as we already know, those are the real decision points. And after grading the rollout, every marked token will be given a tiny extra bonus, so the model will more likely to pass through the same uncertain spots again when running the same sample. This prevents the model from just collapsing onto that one option forever, so future sampling can revisit the same spot and try out different alternatives. This process repeats where branches that lead to a correct final answer will keep getting the bonus and grow, while dead end branches slowly shrink based on the binary signal. Then once a branch consistently succeeds, entropy at that token would drop below the threshold, along with the bonus vanishing, and the exploration there would just naturally disappear. This is like a natural recursive process of improving explorations within RLVR, which is fascinating to see. And if you look at the performance where you simply turn on the bonus, even though within the first 32 tries it underperforms the baseline, but once it tries more than 32 times up to pass 126, the trained model is now able to solve much more diverse problems, kind of like breaking the shrinking behavior curse, which the standard RL method would create, as we also discussed in the last RL video. But if you are too lazy to watch it, it just refers to how RLVR applied onto LLM only boosts the most common behavior, which makes these models more shallow and less diverse at solving questions that require creativity. Hence the reason why when you sample something so many times, it only gives you that handful of response. But here, not only does the model have more diversity than the baseline, it is also able to on average outperform the baseline across major math benchmarks. So by rewarding the model to explore all the branches, it shows that the model now generates more distinct correct proofs instead of just repeating one favorite derivation. On the other hand, the chain of thought process is also longer and more complete. The average solution length grows by 25 to 30%, and manual inspection by the researchers confirmed that the extra steps are genuine intermediate reasoning, not filler, indicating the bonus reward keeping alternative branches alive long enough to find fuller solutions before entropy naturally collapses. So by utilizing entropy as a waypoint to more precisely train a model, seems like a great idea. As this gives the simple binary signal a stronger steering power to improve. So how well you can control RL learning on a fine grain level is probably the next big direction of RLVR. As to how to utilize entropy, these two papers we covered today both proposed some interesting early ideas that might just be the foundation of the new RLVR era. What do you think?
