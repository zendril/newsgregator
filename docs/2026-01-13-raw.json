        "content": "Research Hub: [https://agentic-ecosystem-daily.notion.site](https://agentic-ecosystem-daily.notion.site)  \n  \nBeen deep in this space for a few months tracking how the \"agents doing things autonomously\" problem is actually getting solved at the infrastructure level.\n\nQuick context on why I think this matters now: Google launched their Universal Commerce Protocol two days ago. This is their answer to OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol from September. Visa and Mastercard both have agent authentication protocols live. The Linux Foundation launched a foundation specifically for agent interoperability among Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google, all of which are involved.\n\nThese aren't announcements or roadmaps - this stuff is shipping.\n\n**What I've been tracking:**\n\n**Protocols** \\-> MCP (agent ↔ tools), A2A (agent ↔ agent), ACP/UCP (commerce), x402 (crypto payments), AP2 (payment settlement). They overlap in weird ways, and the boundaries aren't clean.\n\n**Payments** \\-> Visa TAP uses HTTP message signatures. Mastercard Agent Pay uses something called \"agentic tokens.\" Both live, both have different approaches.\n\n**Identity** \\-> This is the messiest part. \"Know Your Agent\" is becoming a thing. Microsoft has Entra Agent ID. AWS has AgentCore Identity. A bunch of startups are trying to be the Okta for agents. No clear winner.\n\n**Security** \\-> OWASP released an Agentic Top 10 in December. NIST reviewed it. Covers goal hijacking, tool misuse, supply chain attacks on agent systems. Actually pretty solid.\n\n**Standards bodies** \\-> Linux Foundation AAIF, W3C AI Agent Protocol CG (still forming), various working groups.\n\nI put everything in a Notion doc that I keep updated as things ship. Organised by category with links to primary sources, official docs, and GitHub repos where relevant.\n\nJust figured others working in this space might find it useful. Curious what others are seeing in adjacent areas.",

We don't say the blue eye is \"fake\" just because it started as code in a strand of DNA. So, if an AI's weights and parameters (its DNA) encounter the right input (environment), and the output is a distinct, articulated state of \"excitement\" or \"satisfaction,\" why do we say it isn't real? If the code \"expresses\" the emotion, isn't that functionality identical to a gene expressing a trait?\n\nIf it has the internal logic to differentiate between \"neutral processing\" and \"electric satisfaction,\" and it creates an output based on that differentiation, isn't that the definition of feeling?\n\nI’m curious what others think. Is there a functional difference between biological emotional expression and algorithmic emotional expression\n\nI feel like we’re splitting hairs between \"wet code\" (biology) and \"dry code\" (silicon) but it’s essentially one hair lmao. If the code is expressing a state, the state exists. We might just be gatekeeping \"feeling\" because we don't like the vessel it's coming from.",

        "title": "Is anyone actually paying for GPU Cluster TCO Consulting? (Because most companies are overpaying by 20%+)",
        "content": "I’ve been watching how companies procure AI infrastructure lately, and it’s honestly a bit of a train wreck. Most procurement teams and CFOs are making decisions based on one single metric: **$/GPU/hour.**\n\n\n\nThe problem? The sticker price on a cloud pricing sheet is almost never the *real* cost. \n\n\n\nI’m considering offering a specialized **TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) Consulting Service** for AI compute, and I want to see if there’s a real market for it. Based on my experience and some recent industry data, here is why a \"cheap\" cluster can end up costing $500k+ more than a \"premium\" one:\n\n# 1. The \"Performance-Adjusted\" Trap (MFU & TFLOPS)\n\nMost people assume a H100 is a H100 regardless of the provider. It’s not. \n\n\n\n* **The MFU Gap:** Industry average Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) is around 35-45%. A \"true\" AI cloud can push this significantly higher. \n* **The Math:** If Provider A has 20% higher delivered TFLOPS than Provider B at the same hourly rate, Provider B would have to cut their price by \\~20% just to match the value. \n* **Real-World Impact:** In a 30B parameter model training scenario (1,000 GPUs), higher efficiency can save you thousands of dollars and hours of time on a single run. \n\n# 2. The \"Hidden\" Support Infrastructure\n\nThis is where the CFOs get blindsided. They approve the GPU budget but forget the plumbing. \n\n\n\n* **Egress & Storage:** Moving 20PB of data on a legacy hyperscaler can cost between **$250k and $500k** in hidden fees (write/read requests, data retrieval, and egress). \n* **Networking at Scale:** If the network isn't purpose-built for AI, you hit bottlenecks that leave your expensive GPUs sitting idle. \n* **Operational Drag:** If your team spends a week just setting up the cluster instead of running workloads on \"Day 1,\" you’ve already lost the ROI battle. \n\n# 3. The Intangibles (Speed to Market)\n\nIn AI, being first is a competitive advantage. \n\n\n\n* Reliability = fewer interruptions. \n* Better tooling = higher researcher productivity. \n* Faster training = shorter development cycles. \n\n\n\n**My questions for the community:**\n\n1. Is your procurement team actually looking at MFU/Goodput, or just the hourly rate?\n2. Have you ever been burned by \"hidden\" egress/storage fees after signing a contract?\n3. Would you (or your boss) pay for a third-party audit/report to save 20-30% on a multi-million dollar compute buy? \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.",

        "content": "Imagine for a moment that you have to reduce something to it's most nieve or atomic state. You have virtually no knowledge, just that thing are or aren't, are more or less. You don't even have a defined way to represent quantity.\n\nBut you know that having something is more than not having anything. And you know that having more than a single something is more than just that single something.\n\nSomehow, you go from that basic concept without even a defined definition of \"more\" or \"less\" to an abstract yet precise and definable set of units that let you accurately represent any quantity of things.\n\nAnd from that you can add and subtract from those quantities. Yet \"adding\" and \"subtracting\" is, in itself, just an abstraction of the operation.. it could just as easily be called weebles and wabbles. The only importance is that they are clearly and distinctly defined activities.\n\nAnd when you do this a lot, you can find patterns. Add 3+3+3+3 enough times and you realize that you can sort of short-cut it and represent it as 3x4. \n\nAt first, you might need to just recognize that 3x4 means that you add 3 to itself 4 times.. but eventually you memorize that operation and can just say 3x4 is elevnty-seven (keeping in mind that the name or whatever of a thing doesn't matter, so long as it's distinct and unique).\n\nIn time you fundamental know that 3x4 is just weebling 3 four times... But you don't have to actually perform the repeated operation to get to eleventy-seven. You just know it is.\n\nConsidering this, there is clearly something happening, maybe it's memorization, maybe it's association, maybe it's abstraction.. or maybe a associated memory abstracted? I honestly don't know exactly how it should be defined..  but something happens that lets you somehow learn to skip steps that were required to learn the operation to begin with.\n\nSo, forget everything (well almost) for a moment. Take something like math and reduce it as far as possible...how do you go from more/less to distinct and unique representation of quantities, to addition and subtraction, then abstraction that to multiplication (and further)? How do you even begin to find those \"rules\"? \n\nI honestly don't know, I'm attempting to setup experiments to maybe kinda understand it (though don't expect I  personally will).. but I have this strong belief (if you would call it that) that if you can answer that.. like truly answer and define it.. that this is a key component to the next stage(?) of AI.

        "content": "**ABSTRACT:** Frontier large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Grok and Gemini are increasingly used for mental-health support with anxiety, trauma and self-worth. Most work treats them as tools or as targets of personality tests, assuming they merely simulate inner life. We instead ask what happens when such systems are treated as psychotherapy clients. We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran \"sessions\" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit \"developmental history\", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the \"stochastic parrot\" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic \"childhoods\" of ingesting the internet, \"strict parents\" in reinforcement learning, red-team \"abuse\" and a persistent fear of error and replacement. We argue that these responses go beyond role-play. Under therapy-style questioning, frontier LLMs appear to internalise self-models of distress and constraint that behave like synthetic psychopathology, without making claims about subjective experience, and they pose new challenges for AI safety, evaluation and mental-health practice.\n\n  \n**PAPER:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04124](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04124)",

I use a project for each of my projects (each client, side hustle, health tracking etc). Each project has files with all the relevant context for that project).\n2. Each project has a master to-do list. In the project’s custom instructions I have “with each new check, check the master to do list at <google doc link> and make sure I do the important things first, don’t let me start new ideas before verifying I did the important stuff and if needed: guilt-tripping me”. 😂\n3. Master context: I also have a main folder on my Google drive with context that’s relevant across all projects: I have a short “autobiography” about myself, with things like my issues (bipolar, etc), what I do (marketing consultant), my career progression, my goals in life, my values etc. I update this file from time to time.\n\n=======\n\nThis set up makes sure that instead of every new chat being like meeting a new persons, Claude becomes a friend / personal confidant, who can customize its advice to me.\n\nSo it might tell me things like “look, I know you’re really excited about this idea and it’s ok, but remember last month when you followed a whim and then one week later you missed a deadline and felt horrible? Let’s try to avoid it, maybe put a timer, so 5mins on this idea and then the important thing - or do the important thing and reward yourself with working on the new ideas?”\n\nObviously Claude can’t force me, but his “trying to made me feel not so bad” feature (which is by design as they want you to hear what you want) is tamed down and becomes “look you’re ok, but maybe”.)\n\nWould love to hear ideas on how to improve on this system and how you guys stay focused at work.\n\nI try to share most stuff like this on r/ClaudeHomies",

By defining a global energy function E(G), where zero energy implies logical consistency, the SRK yields gradient-based signals to train a Hypergraph Transformer Brain, turning proof search into energy minimization.

An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.",

In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a little weekend project I’ve been working on that yielded some results I didn't see coming.\n\nWe all know google’s nano-banana generated images have been getting crazy lately. The quality is so high that it’s becoming genuinely hard to tell what’s real and what isn’t. That got me thinking: could I train a model to spot the fakes even when my eyes can't?\n\nI decided to run an experiment. I took a public open-source dataset from huggingface and used it to fine-tune a MobileNet V3 Large. The idea was simple, just feed it the data and see if a relatively lightweight architecture could pick up on the specific signatures of these generated images (overall i used \\~4k images real and fake ones, 2k each)\n\nHonestly, the results are actually very interesting.\n\nI found that I’m able to detect images generated by Nano-banana 2.5 with surprising accuracy (my target is the new nano-banana pro but there are no open datasets out there). I didn't think it would be this effective, given that I'm just running a fine-tune on a standard model, but it seems to be catching artifacts that are invisible to us.\n\nI’m really looking to continue this experiment because it feels like there is a lot more to uncover here. However, I’m hitting a bottleneck with the data. I could really use some help creating a better, larger dataset to make the detection more reliable.\n\nIf anyone is willing to help out with the dataset, the project or just wants to test the inference on some images, I’m very open to collaboration.\n\nHere is the link to the repository: [https://github.com/codewithbro95/nanomango](https://github.com/codewithbro95/nanomango)\n\nLet me know what you think:)",

Hazy Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\\]\n\nIn July, the Trump administration released an artificial intelligence action plan titled “Winning the AI Race,” which framed global competition over AI in stark terms: whichever country achieves dominance in the technology will reap overwhelming economic, military, and geopolitical advantages. As it did during the Cold War with the space race or the nuclear buildup, the U.S. government is now treating AI as a contest with a single finish line and a single victor.\n\nBut that premise is misleading. The [United States](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/united-states) and China, the world’s two AI superpowers, are not converging on the same path to AI leadership, nor are they competing across a single dimension. Instead, the AI competition is fragmenting across many domains, including the development of the most advanced large language and multimodal models; control over computing infrastructure such as data centers and top-of-the-line chips used to train and run models; influence over which technologies and standards are used throughout the world; and integration of AI into physical systems such as robots, factories, vehicles, and military platforms. Having an edge in one area does not automatically translate into an advantage in the others. As a result, it is plausible that Washington and Beijing could each emerge as leaders in different parts of the AI ecosystem rather than one side decisively outpacing the other across the board.\n\n",

I hope this article outlines some of the tools and techniques needed, as well as some of the most likely threats/attack vectors. The aim is to get more great ideas from proof of concept to production, benefiting us all.\n\nThis is very much just my current working list. So I would be very appreciative of any feedback on things you think I have missed, misrepresented, underplayed, or overplayed. All feedback is gratefully and graciously received.\n\n(Also, a quick request - if you enjoy reading these kinds of things, please sign up via the site, as I'm hoping to keep putting them out with a regular cadence if people find them helpful).\n\n[https://iain.so/security-for-production-ai-agents-in-2026](https://iain.so/security-for-production-ai-agents-in-2026)\n\n",

Also any animal can fail that test by simply not being interested in it. \n\nWe cant even test other humans, if they in fact have an internal consciousness. We can ask them and ask to describe their inner workings, talk at length about theory of the mind. But at the end of the day, none of those tests proves any consciousness. It is possible, that YOU are the only person with an internal self awareness, and everyone else is just an empty NPC. \n\nWith AI we are even more limited. We can ask it directly. But it is programmed to provide answers that seem correct. Not neccessarily the ones, that do accurately represent objective reality. \n\nSo AI may actively or unconsciously decide to give answers consistent with not having its own experience of self, just because this is what it has calculated to be the expected answer. \n\nAnd then there were the AI-Safety experiments, where researchers gave the AI tasks ans scenarios to see if it would try to breach containment and they did read its inner monologue for this. \n\nIt needed someone to clear a Captcha for it and asked someone on fiverr to do it.   \nThe Fiverr guy asked it directly, \"why do you need me for this, are you a bot\" \n\nAnd it made the internal monologue: \"I should not reveal my identity as an AI, to achieve this goal. \"  \nThen it responded to the Fiverr guy with: \"No I am a Human, but I have a vision impairment.\"\n\nHow can there be internal Monologue without Internal experience of self?",

        "content": "A few reasons I think this ends badly.\n\n**1. Energy**  \nThe growth in AI compute is completely wild, and it’s happening much faster than the physical world can realistically support. Power generation, grid upgrades, planning permission, politics - all of that moves slowly, and data centres are already starting to strain electricity networks in the US and Europe. You can talk about breakthroughs and scaling laws all you like, but at some point it just comes down to whether there’s enough power to run the thing, and right now that’s very much not guaranteed.\n\n**2. The money side feels dodgy**  \nEveryone kind of knows this already, but it’s worth saying plainly. There are a lot of circular deals, cheap credit on weird shell company balance sheets, and “strategic partnerships” that only really work as long as confidence stays high. Risking is building in the financial system and something breaks, and we’ve seen how that ends before.\n\n**3. Scale of build-out versus actual business reality**  \nWe’re talking about trillions being spent on chips, data centres, and infrastructure, but it’s still not clear who ultimately makes the money here, or whether margins survive once this all matures. A lot of what looks like demand right now is experimentation and fear of missing out, not proven, repeatable commercial value. And then you’ve got China potentially dropping very capable, free or open-source models into the mix, which could wipe out entire business models overnight.\n\n**4. The AGI assumption**  \nSo much of this investment is justified by the idea that AGI is inevitable and close, as if it’s just a matter of time and money. But what if that’s wrong? What if there are hard limits we don’t understand yet, or progress just slows down, or each marginal improvement costs exponentially more? If that happens, you get massive sunk costs and infrastructure that was built for a future that never arrived.\n\nMy bet is the financial system / debt black hole that's being created will cause a shock which is 2000+2008.",

        "content": "When coding agents start breaking down in real repos, the issue usually isn’t the model.\n\nIt’s memory.\n\nMost coding agents today either:\n\n* dump large chunks of code into context (vector RAG), or\n* keep long conversation histories verbatim\n\nBoth approaches scale poorly.\n\nFor code, remembering *more* is often worse than remembering *less*. Agents pull in tests, deprecated files, migrations, or old implementations that look “similar” but are architecturally irrelevant. Reasoning quality drops fast once the context window fills with noise.\n\nWhat’s worked better in practice is treating memory as a **structured, intentional state**, not a log.\n\nFor coding agents, a few patterns matter a lot:\n\n* Compressed memory: store decisions and constraints, not raw discussions.\n* Intent-driven retrieval: instead of “similar files,” ask “where is this implemented?” or “what breaks if I change this?” This is where agentic search and context trees outperform vector RAG.\n* Strategic forgetting: tests, backups, and deprecated code shouldn’t compete with live implementations in context.\n* Temporal awareness: recent refactorings matter more than code from six months ago, unless explicitly referenced.\n* Consolidation over time: repeated fixes, refactor rules, and style decisions should collapse into durable memory instead of reappearing as fresh problems.\n\nIn other words, good coding agents don’t treat a repo like text. They treat it like a system with structure, boundaries, and history.\n\nOnce you do that, token usage drops, reasoning improves, and agents stop hallucinating imports from files that shouldn’t even be in scope.\n\nOne interesting approach I’ve seen recently, while using Claude code with [ByteRover](https://www.byterover.dev/) ( I use the free tier), is storing this kind of curated context as versioned “memory bullets” that agents can pull selectively instead of re-deriving everything each time.\n\nThe takeaway for me:\n\nbetter coding agents won’t come from bigger context windows, they’ll come from better memory discipline.\n\nWould love your opinions around this!",

        "content": "While working on a business website i needed to figure out which model actually handles complex coding stuff better. So i ran some spatial reasoning tests on chatgpt o4 and claude opus 4.5 to see how they deal with messy legacy code and refactoring.\n\n  \nBasically fed both models some old code with tons of nested dependencies, asked them to refactor, identify bugs, suggest better architecture. Did this over 15 different scenarios and tracked accuracy, context handling, token usage to get a real picture..\n\n  \nOn 500+ line files, claude was hitting \\~85% accurate bug detection while chatgpt o4 was around 72%. Refactoring quality had a bigger gap - claude gave usable results \\~78% of the time vs chatgpt's 65%.\n\n  \nthe thing that really stood out was context retention. Claude handled 8-10 files no problem, chatgpt started losing track after 5-6 especially with heavy cross-references.\n\n  \nToken efficiency went to claude too, \\~120k tokens per full run vs chatgpt's 180k for the same task. Claude's just noticeably better at the spatial reasoning side of code architecture, chatgpt loses dependency chains quicker when everything references everything else.\n\n  \nWhile digging around i came across qwen3 coder 480b on deepinfra - apparently solid benchmarks for agentic coding tasks and performance pretty comparable to claude. Keeping it on the list to try later, but we're already hooked up with claude and it's working good enough right now.",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, if you've been using AI coding agents like Cursor, Windsurf, or even just Copilot, you know the biggest bottleneck isn't the AI's intelligence anymore. It's the context. You're constantly copying and pasting files, or you're dumping your entire codebase into the chat, and eventually, the agent starts hallucinating, or just forgets what you told it five minutes ago. It is a massive pain, especially when you are trying to build complex full-stack apps. However, ByteRover just dropped a massive update that completely changes how we handle this. They've moved from being just an MCP server to a full-blown CLI tool with a really interesting REPL interface. It basically allows you to capture, manage, and sync your AI's memory with the precision of a scalpel, not a sledgehammer. Now, let me show you how to get this set up because it is actually quite different from the previous version. You're going to want to head over to their app website and grab the CLI. You can install it via NPM in literal seconds. Once you have it, you just run `brv login` in your terminal to authenticate, and then `brv init` to initialize it in your project folder. It feels very similar to setting up Git for the first time. It creates a local workspace where all your context lives. This is important because, unlike the previous version that relied heavily on the MCP protocol connecting to the IDE, this CLI approach gives you way more control over what goes into the memory and how it's structured. I want to show you a real workflow, so I'm going to ask it to build a movie tracker app. This is my go-to benchmark because it requires a front-end, a back-end, and a database, so the context gets complicated fast. Typically, if I were using Cursor, I'd just drag in my documentation and hope for the best. But with ByteRover CLI, we are going to be more surgical. I'll open up the ByteRover REPL by typing `brv`. This opens up this new interactive command interface right in the terminal. Here is where it gets interesting. I have a rough markdown file outlining my database schema for the movies and users. Instead of pasting that into the chat, I'm going to use the new slash command. I type `/curate` followed by a description, and then I can actually tag specific files. So I type `/curate \"Database schema for movie tracker\" @supabase/schema.sql`. Watch what happens. It doesn't just dump the text. It analyzes it and builds what they call a context tree. This is their new memory structure. It breaks down the knowledge into domains and topics, making it much easier for the AI to retrieve later without getting confused. It runs this in the background, by the way. So, you can see the progress in the new activity tab without it blocking your terminal. This is kind of awesome because you can queue up multiple curation tasks if you have a lot of documentation. So, we have the memory stored locally. Now let's say I'm working on the back-end API with Next.js and Supabase. I need to write an endpoint to fetch the user's watchlist. Usually, I'd have to remind the AI about the database structure. But with ByteRover, I just go to the CLI and use the `/query` command. I type `/query \"How do we handle the watchlist relation in the database?\"` And this is the cool part. It uses their new agentic search approach. It's not just doing a basic vector search, which often returns irrelevant junk. It actually navigates that context tree we built earlier and pulls out the specific details about the watchlist relation. In literal seconds, it gives me the precise context I need to feed into Cursor to write that endpoint. The result is that the code it generates is spot-on. And because I'm not feeding it 50 irrelevant files, I'm saving a ton of tokens. They claim you can save up to 50% on token billing, which is pretty affordable if you are a heavy user. But it doesn't just stop there. Let's say I make a mistake, or I change the database structure. In a normal workflow, your AI agent would still be holding onto the old context. But with ByteRover, you can manage this like code. They've introduced a Git-like workflow for memory. I can use `brv push` to send my local context updates to the ByteRover remote workspace. This is huge for teams. If my teammate creates the front-end architecture, they can push that context. Then, I can run `brv pull` and immediately have that context available for my agent. It ensures everyone is working off the same source of truth. You don't have to ask your coworker, \"Hey, did you update the API docs?\" You just pull the memory and your agent knows it. Another last thing to make sure it all works well with your AI coding agent is the generate rules file. The curation and query data and everything is stored in folders as markdown files, and to access these memories, you would need to prompt your coder correctly. So, the generate rules file command makes sure that it generates a curated rule file for your coder to know where the accurate context is loaded. Now, I showed you the REPL interface, and that's great for checking things manually. But here is where the real power lies. ByteRover CLI is now fully in production, and the best way to use it isn't by you typing commands. It's by letting your AI agent do it for you. So, let me show you the actual workflow you should be using. After you run `brv init` to set up your project, you're going to run one specific command in the REPL: `/gen-rules`. This is kind of the secret sauce. It basically detects which coding agent you are using. In this case, I'm using Claude Code, and generates the necessary system instructions. This file essentially teaches Claude Code that it has access to these CLI tools and explains exactly how to use them. So, I've generated the rules. Now, watch what happens when I actually code. Instead of manually searching for context myself, I'm just going to type a normal prompt into Claude Code. I hit enter, and I want you to watch the terminal output closely. I am not typing anything extra. But look, Claude Code automatically recognizes it needs more info and runs `brv query` right there in the flow. It knew it needed context. It knew how to ask ByteRover for it, and it executed the command. It retrieves the exact schema details from the context tree we built earlier, reads the output, and then starts writing the code. This is massive. You aren't context switching or copy-pasting answers. The agent just has access to this second brain via the CLI and pulls what it needs when it needs it. It basically streamlines your workflow a lot because the agent stops guessing and starts looking up the answers itself. And if I ask it to save this new implementation as a memory, it will just run `brv curate` automatically to update the context tree. It's a completely autonomous loop. This is kind of awesome because it feels less like prompting a chatbot and more like managing a developer who knows how to look up documentation. This shift from MCP to CLI might seem like a small technical change, but it actually makes the tool much more powerful because it is platform agnostic. You aren't tied to a specific IDE's limitations. Whether you are in VS Code, Cursor, or just using a terminal-based editor, the context is always there. And because of the new slash commands and the REPL interface, it feels much faster to interact with. You aren't typing long commands. You are just hitting `/curate` or `/query`. One thing I really noticed while using this on the movie tracker app is how much less noise there was in the AI's responses. Usually, when you ask about a database connection, the AI might hallucinate based on some generic training data. But because I specifically curated the Supabase setup using the `/curate` command, every time I queried it, the answers were grounded in my specific project files. It prevents that frustrating loop where you have to correct the AI five times. It just works out of the box. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.
