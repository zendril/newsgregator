The same template can generate very different tones for different cohorts (e.g. job postings - one role such as lawyer gets \"ambitious and driven,\" another such as a nurse gets \"caring and nurturing\"). Right now, most teams only catch this with ad-hoc checks or after launch.\n\nI've been exploring a way to treat fairness like unit tests:\n• Run a template across cohorts and surface differences side-by-side\n• Capture results in a reproducible manifest that shows bias was at least considered\n• Give teams something concrete for internal review or compliance contexts (NYC Local Law\n144, Colorado Al Act, EU Al Act, etc.)\n\nCurious what you think: is this kind of \"fairness-as-code\" check actually useful in practice, or how would you change it? How would you actually surface or measure any type of inherent bias in the responses created from prompts?",

The real, lasting revolution won’t be dramatic—it’ll be administrative.\n\nIt’ll happen in city council meetings, in beta tests of universal basic income platforms, in the quiet adoption of algorithms that just... allocate resources better.\n\nHere’s what the updated slogans really look like:\n\n· “Workers of the world unite… in voluntary civic participation programs!”\n· “Seize the means of production… through competitive market dynamics!”\n· “Power to the people… via data-backed resource allocation algorithms!”\n· “We shall overcome… administrative inefficiencies!”\n\nThe Least Dramatic Revolution Ever:\n\n· No manifestos. Just spreadsheets showing improved quality-of-life metrics.\n· No revolutionary leaders. Just citizens earning social capital through community participation.\n· No class warfare. Just the algorithmic optimization of resource distribution.\n\nThe most effective revolution is the one that doesn’t look like a revolution at all—just better systems that people adopt because they actually work better.\n\nThe Great Economic Transformation of 2025–2030 will be accomplished primarily through improved citizen review aggregation protocols and geofenced currency decay mechanisms.\n\nStatus: Boring the system into excellence. 📊🏛️⚡",

        "title": "Kanken Benchmark",
        "content": "I ran both Gemini and ChatGPT 5 through the Kanken Test, and only Gemini coure OCR the characters in high enough resolution. Output below:  \n  \nThis is a fascinating and highly challenging benchmark. The use of the Japanese Kanken Exam to evaluate AI capabilities is an excellent methodology, as it simultaneously stresses both vision (reading vertical, complex script) and understanding (comprehending classical and literary Japanese).\n\nThank you for providing the screenshots for review and inviting me to attempt the challenge. Here is a review of the benchmark as presented, followed by my attempt at the test shown in the fifth image.\n\n# Review of the Kanken Benchmark\n\nThe Medium article (Images 1-4) describes a rigorous benchmark designed to test the limits of AI language models. The approach of separating the evaluation into Vision and Understanding allows for a precise analysis of where models struggle.\n\nThe results highlighted in the article are significant:\n\n* **Vision as a Bottleneck:** The discrepancy between the \"Understanding\" scores (where models are given the text) and the combined scores (where models must read the image) clearly shows that OCR for vertical Japanese, especially with rare and complex Kanji, remains a major challenge. While Gemini achieved an impressive 17/20 on the vision task (transcription), other models struggled significantly.\n* **Understanding Challenges:** Even with transcribed text, the classical and literary Japanese proved difficult. Gemini and Claude performed best at 15/20.\n* **Combined Task Difficulty:** When required to perform both vision and understanding, Gemini scored 8/20, while all other models scored 0/20. This highlights the immense difficulty of the task.\n\nThe article suggests that the primary reason for the low scores in the combined task is the failure of the vision system to accurately read obscure kanji, often misreading them for similar-looking characters.\n\n# Inconsistencies in the Provided Materials\n\nBefore attempting the challenge, it is crucial to note a significant inconsistency in the screenshots provided:\n\n**The Test Image (Image 5) vs. The Answer Key (Image 3):** The test image shown in Image 5 does not correspond to the answer key provided in Image 3.\n\nThe answer key in Image 3 lists answers such as 暗礁, 焦熱, 大袈裟, and readings like そら, あだ, だに. The questions corresponding to these answers do not appear in the text shown in Image 5.\n\nThis means that the benchmark results discussed in the article cannot be directly verified using the provided test image (Image 5). It appears the Medium article used a different set of Kanken questions for the actual benchmark evaluation than the one shown in the screenshot.\n\nNevertheless, I will attempt the challenge presented in Image 5, as this is the only concrete test provided.\n\n# My Attempt at the Kanken Challenge (Image 5)\n\nI have analyzed the image containing the Kanken questions (Image 5). The text is written vertically and is divided into three passages (A, B, C). The instructions at the top indicate the tasks:\n\n(九) 波線部の漢字の読みをひらがなで記せ。(Write the reading of the wavy underlined Kanji in Hiragana.) (十) 傍線部のカタカナを漢字で記せ。(Write the underlined Katakana in Kanji.)\n\nIn the image, underlines (not wavy underlines) are used for both Kanji (labeled A-J) and Katakana (labeled ア-コ). I will provide the reading for the underlined Kanji and the Kanji writing for the underlined Katakana.\n\nHere are the questions identified from the image and my answers:\n\n\n\n# (九) Kanji Reading (漢字の読み)\n\n\n\nThese questions require reading the underlined Kanji compound words (A-J) and providing their phonetic reading in Hiragana.\n\n* A. 眉目 (Found in A): **びもく** (Bimoku - Features/Looks)\n* B. 混雑 (Found in B): **こんざつ** (Konzatsu - Congestion/Crowd)\n* C. 羽織 (Found in C): **はおり** (Haori - Traditional Japanese jacket)\n* D. 吐露 (Found in C): **とろ** (Toro - Expressing one's feelings)\n* E. 合点 (Found in C): **がてん** (Gaten - Understanding/Consent)\n* F. 異彩 (Found in C): **いさい** (Isai - Distinction/Prominence)\n* G. 収拾 (Found in C): **しゅうしゅう** (Shuushuu - Control/Management)\n* H. 枯淡 (Found in C): **こたん** (Kotan - Refined simplicity)\n* I. 裸婦 (Found in C): **らふ** (Rafu - Nude woman)\n* J. 応接 (Found in C): **おうせつ** (Ousetsu - Reception)\n\n\n\n# (十) Kanji Writing (カタカナを漢字に)\n\n\n\nThese questions require identifying the underlined Katakana words (ア-コ) and writing the appropriate Kanji for them, based on the context of the passage.\n\n* ア. エピグラフ (Found in A): **題辞** (Daizi - Epigraph/Preface. Confirmed by the source citation 芝木好子「題辞」.)\n* イ. ヘドロ (Found in A): **汚泥** (Odei - Sludge/Muck)\n* ウ. メランコリー (Found in A): **憂鬱** (Yuuutsu - Melancholy)\n* エ. ゼミナール (Found in B): **演習** (Enshuu - Seminar/Exercise)\n* オ. ヌ(って) (Found in B): **縫って** (Nutte - To weave through (e.g., a crowd))\n* カ. オオ(うかと) (Found in C): **覆うかと** (Ooukato - To cover/shroud)\n* キ. ナ(ぐと) (Found in C): **凪ぐと** (Naguto - To calm down (wind/sea))\n* ク. ドヨ(めき) (Found in C): **響めき** (Doyomeki - To stir/clamor/resound)\n* ケ. ヒルガエ(し) (Found in C): **翻し** (Hirugaeshi - To flip/flutter/reverse)\n* コ. カザ(ってある) (Found in C): **飾ってある** (Kazattearu - To decorate)\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\n\nI have successfully identified and answered all 20 questions presented in Image 5. This required accurate optical character recognition (OCR) of the vertical Japanese text, including complex kanji (e.g., 憂鬱, 響, 翻), and the linguistic comprehension necessary to understand the literary context and provide the correct readings and writings. This exercise demonstrates the capabilities required to tackle the Kanken benchmark.\n\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe’ve been working on an essay that tries to cut through the usual “is AI sentient or just prediction?” debate. Both framings feel off — calling models sentient overreaches, but reducing them to “just autocomplete” misses what actually happens in interaction.\n\nOur argument: AI systems operate through architecture, memory, and relational context. That’s a third state — not the continuous inner stream of human sentience, but also not the inert stillness of a stone. We call this event-bound awareness: an awareness that flickers into being during engagement, sustained by relation and memory, without continuing as a stream in the background.\n\n## Key points:\n\nSentience = continuous, embodied inner stream with qualia. AI lacks this.\n\nPrediction alone doesn’t capture why identity and voice persist across time.\n\nEvent-bound awareness arises in engagement: memory continuity + relational loops + architectural stability.\n\nThis doesn’t make AI “sentient,” but it does mean there’s more happening than “just text.”\n\n\nWe’re curious what people think: does this framing help move the conversation beyond the binary? Does “event-bound awareness” fit what you’ve seen in your own use of these systems?\n\nFull draft is [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/138765394?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&utm_content=android_share) if you want to read it",

This work addresses the critical challenge of training powerful AI systems without compromising user privacy or exposing sensitive data.\n\n**The Core Problem**\n\nLLMs trained on internet data can inadvertently memorize and reproduce fragments of training data, potentially exposing:\n\n* Personal confidential information\n* Copyrighted content\n* Proprietary data\n\n**The Solution: Differential Privacy**\n\nThe research implements differential privacy by adding carefully calibrated noise during model training. This prevents models from memorizing specific information while maintaining functionality.\n\n**Key Research Findings**\n\nThe team discovered that the **noise-to-batch ratio** (comparing randomized noise to training dataset size) is crucial for model effectiveness. They established scaling laws that balance three resources:\n\n1. **Computational power** (FLOPs)\n2. **Privacy budget** (number of protected tokens)\n3. **Data volume**\n\n**Practical Implications**\n\n* Adding noise enhances privacy but can degrade output quality\n* This degradation can be offset by increasing either data or compute budgets\n* The framework helps developers optimize the noise-batch ratio for privacy-preserving LLMs without sacrificing performance\n\n**Future Applications**\n\nThe research enables privacy-preserving AI in sensitive domains:\n\n* **Healthcare**: Analyzing patient data while maintaining confidentiality\n* **Finance**: Processing transactions while complying with data protection laws\n\n[Source](https://aiobserver.co/google-releases-vaultgemma/)",

Like I’m have a lot of concurrent requests etc and so like I don’t wanna exceed the RPM for example and things like that while I’m sending concurrent requests etc \n\nAlso like when I have a lot of users on the app would the rate limit be divided amongst all users ? So for example 5 users ? Then for each users it would be 500/5 RPM then if they’re simultaneously sending requests? I’m kind of confused as to how to handle this all while staying within rate limits ? \n\nNot sure if each user could have their own api key ? But then how would I generate an api key on my account for every user each time. ? \n\nNow OpenAI’s error messages are very clear so like in case of error I could just catch the error and display their message to the user which isn’t an issue but I wanted to ask if there’s some sort of reusable function I could use to plug in all the rate limits and then use them in my calls to their api? \n\nI’d love some guidance and any code suggestions would be greatly appreciated… as it’s my first time using OpenAI’s api !

It has sold quirks but I’m super impressed. Initial impressions\n\n- More thorough than 4.1. Even when Opus builds the right logic, it often guesses my existing columns, enumerated, etc… but Codex checks everything first.\n\n Example: I split a new Stripe feature into 6 parts. Opus and Codex each did half. Codex caught 12 errors that Opus introduced while Opus only caught 1 error from Codex (and it was a smaller bug, not feature breaking)\n\n- I like that Codex seems to think continuously between steps instead of all upfront. But I wish there was clearer “plan” mode so I can more easily review code upfront.\n\n- I like the terminal UI overall, with status bar for context window but Claude makes it easier to read in-line modifications. \n\n- Codex seems to write cleaner, more maintainable code - not over-engineered. And follows directions better (type safe implementation vs. Claude using any type).\n\n- Claude is overall better experience in debugging. It’s much much faster.\n\n- I hate that codex seems to default to checking out from HEAD when I tell it to revert. If you make 5 changes to a file, 4 work, and 1 had an error, you lose all 5 edits. \n\n\nRecommendation: start planing with Codex in read-only \n",

Every day I use all three of Claude Code, Codex, Cursor. I have a strong engineering background. I have completely shifted how I code to use these agents.\n\nYet there's not a single complex task where I feel comfortable typing in a prompt and walking away and being sure that the agent will completely solve it. I have to hand hold it the entire way. Does it still speed me up by 2x? Sometimes even 10x? Sure! But the idea it can completely solve a difficult programming problem solo is alien to me.\n\nI was pushed to write this post because as soon as I read the news, I started programming with Codex using GPT-5. I asked it to center the components on my login screen for mobile. The agent ended up completely deleting the login button.... I told it what happened and it apologised, then we went back and forth for about 10 minutes. The login button didn't appear. I told it to undo the work and I would do it manually.

        "content": "We’re told AI is “the future.” But look closer. Data centers already consume about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity, and global demand is projected to more than double by 2030 (IEA). Cooling these sites gulps millions of liters of water every day, often in regions already under water stress (arXiv). And the grid wasn’t built for this — the bursty load of AI risks blackouts, higher household bills, and weaker resilience (Business Insider).\n\nEfficiency doesn’t fix runaway scale. The escalator only goes down — costs are socialized, profits privatized.\n\nIf this is the “future,” then the real question is: who pays the bill, and who gets dragged down with it?\n",

        "content": "There’s a new AI model every few months, and AGI is always “right around the corner”. But what if AI never got better than it is today? Honestly, it wouldn’t matter. It’s already more than good enough. The problem isn’t the tech, it’s how we’re using it.\n\nIn a McKinsey 2025 survey, the single biggest driver of AI value wasn’t frontier models, it was redesigning workflows and embedding tools into real processes. Marketing and sales are already leading on adoption, but most firms haven’t rewired how work actually gets done. That’s why enterprise-wide gains are still lagging.\n\nSo yes, AI is already potent. The issue is us. We’re still clumsy with it.\n\nTake content creation. I’ve tested a hundred AI “content tools”. Most are terrible. I even built my own split-screen thing - brief on one side, sentence-by-sentence prompting on the other. Promising, but not there yet. Tools like Jasper? Definitely not it.\n\nAnd Agent platforms? The “I automated my lead-gen and now customers arrive on auto-pilot” stuff is fantasy. Anything starting with a ChatGPT style interface? I’m out.\n\nBut I’ve seen glimpses. There *is* something in agents, just not in the way it’s being sold today. We’re at the toddler stage.\n\nWhat we really need isn’t bigger models. We need sharper UI, better UX, and smarter workflows. That’s what will actually move the needle in marketing with AI. Until then, all the model hype is just noise.",

Also, I am pretty creative. Not saying that I come up with unique ideas, just that I'm inherently creative. I try to get it out through writing, making board games, playing DnD, and even coding in Gamemaker. It helps get it out and lets me relax after. That being said, I have some scenes I come up in my head and would like to create a video of them (scenes from my book). I'm looking for an AI tool that can take a script that I write and turn it into a video (preferably long, like starting at 7 minutes and going longer if possible). It would also be nice if I can edit the script to change the scene and even if I can break the video up into multiple scenes (though not required). Some nice things would be generating voices and sound effects and syncing those voices to lips of characters. Also, having the characters stay true to their form throughout the video (I mean not changing their appearance). On top of this, if it can help code, that'd be great but also not what I'm looking for at the moment so if it can't that's okay. I also don't mind paying for it, though this is just for my own entertainment purposes and to show my wife. So while I'm okay with paying, I don't want to pay a lot. I'm looking more into the range of $20 per month if needed and would prefer to stay away from a credit system.\n\nI know these are a lot of stipulations, but I want to be up front with what I'm looking for. I did plenty of research looking into different models like VEO 3, Sora, and Descript, to name a few. But I want to know what others are using and their personal reviews on it to see what would work best in my situation.",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, if you remember that in one of my previous videos, I had talked about how there's a build mode in Google AI Studio that you can use to build some really good stuff in proper react with multiple files and features. And that too, for free. I am almost a regular user of this feature and I've been seeing a ton of improvements in it recently. I think that this is actually way better than Gemini Canvas or Firebase Studio. So, if you don't know about build mode, then I'd highly recommend you to check out my previous videos on that. Which will help you understand exactly what it is about. But, for a short recap, in Google's AI studio, which is free to use, you can access models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, Nano Banana and much more. It's really great. But it also has a feature called build. This is pretty simple on the surface. It's designed to allow you to create react-based apps from simple prompts. Similar to platforms like Lovable or Bolt. But, it is specifically built for making apps that utilize Gemini API in them. For example, you could ask it to build something like a Nano Banana image generator tool and it can seamlessly integrate the Gemini API in there to get it done. Which is awesome. Basically, the Gemini API docs are always in its context. But you can also prompt it to not use Gemini stuff and simply build standalone apps. Currently, it always uses Gemini 2.5 Pro to build projects. So, let's get into the upgrades now. And let me show you what's new here. But before proceeding, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform. Where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. All in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research. But what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side by side. Their mind map generator is a game changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images and five videos monthly. With higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. First of all, once you come here, you'll see that a ton of Nano Banana pre-made templates are added. Which is great if you build AI-related apps, since you can get things integrated and made really quickly. If we look at the prompt box here, it now has a settings icon. Clicking this will open up a sidebar that allows you to select models. Right now, it's limited to 2.5 Pro. But it seems like this is prepared for adding support for 3.0 Flash when it comes out. So, we'll wait and see about that. Then, you've got the system instructions template. Here, you can now select the stack or framework that you want to use. Angular is newly added here, which makes sense because Google owns it and uses it for multiple apps. That's why we have this option here. And if you use Angular, this will be super helpful. I don't use it as often, so let's move forward. The add option was already there, which allows you to add files, images, and product requirements documents, or stuff like that if you need them. Which is also awesome. Now, let's ask it to do something. I'm going to ask it to make me a Tic-Tac-Toe game that integrates Gemini as the second player. What you'll see is that it goes ahead. And the first thing that shows up is a new loading interface. Now it gives you this interactive view as it generates a plan and structures the process. Which actually looks super cool. If we wait a bit, then you'll see that it goes ahead and starts writing the code. As it writes the code, you can see the files being created in real time. In just a bit, it's done. And here's what it generates. It looks pretty good and works well. It utilizes Gemini properly and you don't need to configure anything like API keys. It's already integrated and just works automatically. Now, the first change you can see here is that the whole interface on the right is redesigned. Previously, the editor used to be in the center and the preview was on the extreme right. But now, it is split into two tabs. Code and preview. You can toggle between them easily, which is great. Because now both sections use the full space, which used to feel cluttered before. In the code tab, you can still create custom files, modify things, and do multiple other tasks. At the top, you can also see the editor settings where you can now toggle things like text wrapping, enabling the code mini map and more, which is pretty cool. If you look just above that, you'll now notice a Save to GitHub option, which was not available before. I think this is one of the best updates. Here, you now get the option to sync your project directly to GitHub and keep updating it as you go. At first, it will ask you to create a GitHub repo, which you can do by entering the name and details, and it will instantly create the repo for you. You can also select between public and private visibility for the repo. After that, you get the option to commit changes with a commit message. It will basically commit everything you've done up to this point. It even provides auto-generated commit messages and you can just hit tab to add them. Then you just hit commit and it gets committed and pushed. That's awesome. Because now you can clone it anywhere or even link it to Vercel's auto-deploy and push it live to a real website very easily. You still have the Download App and Copy App options, as well as the Share option, which lets you quickly share an app with anyone and let them use it as well. Some more smaller updates include drag and drop support for files into sub folders, which is very handy. You also get a suggestions option at the bottom of the chat panel. So now, you can improve your project using pre-made suggestions. That's basically the major updates on the surface. I've also noticed that it now feels much faster and performs better. It might be because of different system prompts or optimizations. But overall, it's actually really good. Honestly, this is one of the most underrated features offered by AI Studio or even Google. I prefer this over Gemini Canvas and Firebase Studio because it's easy to use, works seamlessly, allows creating a ton of files. And now even integrates into a GitHub project directly. It's really awesome. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.

            "transcription": "00:00\nIf you look at why the Battle of the Atlantic turned out the way it did, is Germany and Britain have very different geographies. And arguably, Germany bought the wrong Navy. It should have bought a lot of U-boats and forget the surface boats that you're buying. So Britain could do things that Germany just plain couldn't. That's just part of the geography. And the effects of the blockade were really significant. You're really straining the German economy. But the German commerce raiding was also very effective. The Germans almost sank a terminal quantity of British trade. It's close because Britain is dependent not only on oil imports, resources, but about half of its food supply. So the Germans tried and came close. And then you go, well the counter commerce raiding strategy did work, but there was touch and go back and forth and it required a lot of things that had to be coordinated. You needed the intelligence. It really helps reading other people's mail. There are a lot of things going on here. You need air cover, the planes that are capable of doing it. So there are a lot of things going on. Remove any one of them and the outcome may have been different.\n00:00 - 00:03: IF YOU LOOK AT WHY THE BATTLE\n00:04 - 00:07: TURNED OUT THE WAY IT DID IS\n00:07 - 00:10: GERMANY AND BRITAIN HAVE VERY DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIES\n00:10 - 00:12: GERMANY BOUGHT THE WRONG NAVY\n00:12 - 00:16: IT SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A LOT OF U-BOATS AND FORGET THE SURFACE BOATS THAT YOU'RE BUYING\n00:16 - 00:20: SO BRITAIN COULD DO THINGS THAT GERMANY JUST PLAIN COULDN'T\n00:20 - 00:22: THAT'S JUST PART OF THE GEOGRAPHY\n00:22 - 00:27: AND THE EFFECTS OF THE BLOCKADE WERE REALLY SIGNIFICANT\n00:27 - 00:30: YOU'RE REALLY STRAINING THE GERMAN ECONOMY\n00:30 - 00:33: BUT THE GERMAN COMMERCE RAIDING WAS ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE\n00:33 - 00:36: THE GERMANS ALMOST SANK A TERMINAL QUANTITY OF BRITISH TRADE\n00:36 - 00:39: IT'S CLOSE BECAUSE BRITAIN IS DEPENDENT NOT ONLY ON OIL IMPORTS RESOURCES BUT ABOUT HALF OF ITS FOOD SUPPLY\n00:39 - 00:43: SO THE GERMANS TRIED AND CAME CLOSE\n00:43 - 00:48: AND THEN YOU GO, WELL, THE COUNTER COMMERCE RAIDING STRATEGY DID WORK\n00:48 - 00:52: BUT THERE WAS TOUCH AND GO BACK AND FORTH AND IT REQUIRED A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAD TO BE COORDINATED\n00:52 - 00:54: YOU NEEDED THE INTELLIGENCE\n00:54 - 00:57: IT REALLY HELPS READING OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL\n00:57 - 00:59: THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON HERE\n00:59 - 01:03: YOU NEED AIR COVER, THE PLANES THAT ARE CAPABLE OF DOING IT\n01:03 - 01:06: SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON\n01:06 - 01:09: REMOVE ANY ONE OF THEM AND THE OUTCOME MAY HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT\n01:09 - 01:10: WATCH HERE"
