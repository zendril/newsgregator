We can use AI but we should concider Limiting it by only allowing it to be on a Display or running from a computer. If AI gets put in the physical world, the 3D then its already over. It gets more intelligent and believe me they will clone themselves if they have to \"evolve\" or help out the planet. This will result in Human extinction. So my message out there is: watch out and dont let it run 24/7 or in the physical space. dont let it evolve too much if you even care the slightest about humanity and if you dont you wouldnt be here.",

Especially from people coming over from c.ai.\n\nIf we’re being honest, the only reason that’s happening is because we’ve been talking with the community nonstop and taking feedback even when it’s… brutal. Like “this sucks, fix it” levels of honest. And weirdly, that’s been the most helpful thing for us.\n\nBecause of that, we really believe Reddit is *the* place where AI chat users actually speak their minds. We want to keep building Storychat *with* the community, not just around it, and we want the subreddit to be a place where feedback and discussion actually matter.\n\nSo here’s the idea:\n\nWe’d love to do an AMA one weekend this month where people can ask us anything about Storychat. The good, the bad, the confusing, the “why did you build it like this” questions. All of it.\n\nThe problem is… we don’t want to drop an AMA where no one wants it.\n\nIf you know subreddits where\n\npeople are genuinely curious about AI chat apps\n\nAMA posts are welcome\n\nusers won’t immediately go “ugh another ad”\n\nwe’d really appreciate recommendations.\n\nIf you run a subreddit, feel free to reach out.\n\nIf you know mods who might be open to it, introductions are welcome.\n\nAnd if anyone here is interested in being part of Storychat’s *very early* days and helping grow the subreddit itself, we’re also open to moderator applications.\n\nYes, mods get lifetime top-tier access. We’re serious. And a little desperate. 😂\n\nThanks for reading, and seriously, drop any suggestions.\n\nWe’re probably the most community-obsessed team you’ll meet.",

        "content": "Back in the early pro-audio days, Alesis ran a whimsical ad for a squid-like creature called the **“Jovian Cyberplug”** — a cybernetic universal adapter that could connect incompatible audio gear and effects standards. It was satire… but also a perfect engineering metaphor.\n\nThe AI ecosystem is now where audio gear was then:  \n**different standards, different connectors, different “dialects,” constant breaking changes.**\n\nWhat we need is a *Python Cyberplug*: a modular adapter layer that lets downstream code talk to “a model” through a **single stable interface**, while still exposing each model’s unique strengths.\n\nThe key isn’t to pretend models are identical. The key is to make differences:\n\n# discoverable, negotiated, and contained\n\n# 1) Discoverable\n\nEvery provider/model exposes a **capability profile** your code can query at runtime.\n\nExamples:\n\n* supports\\_tools / vision / json\\_schema\n* supports\\_reasoning / long\\_context\n* max\\_context\\_tokens / max\\_output\\_tokens\n* streaming? structured outputs? function calling?\n* quirks: required message roles, parameter naming, etc.\n\nSo your app can ask:  \n“Who can do tool calls + JSON schema + long context?”  \nand get a clean answer without hardcoding providers everywhere.\n\n# 2) Negotiated\n\nYour unified request is a *superset*, and adapters **negotiate** the best mapping.\n\nIf a feature isn’t supported, the adapter can:\n\n* degrade gracefully (schema → “JSON-only prompt contract”)\n* translate parameters (max\\_output\\_tokens vs max\\_completion\\_tokens vs max\\_tokens)\n* switch endpoint styles internally (e.g., Responses vs Chat Completions)\n* emit explicit “negotiation events” for transparency\n\nThis is the difference between “it broke again” and “it downgraded, here’s why.”\n\n# 3) Contained\n\nAll dialect drift lives inside adapters.  \nYour application code never becomes a zoo of provider conditionals.\n\nNo more:\n\n    if provider == \"X\": use_param_A()\n    elif provider == \"Y\": use_param_B()\n    \n\nInstead, you call one thing:\n\n    cyberplug.generate(request)\n    \n\n# Why this matters\n\nWe’re moving toward an era where “which model?” should be a **runtime decision**, not a code rewrite:\n\n* Choose a fast cheap model for summaries\n* Choose a reasoning model for planning and proofs\n* Choose a tool-capable model for automation\n* Choose vision for document/image tasks\n* And *log exactly what was negotiated* so you can trust it\n\nIf the community converged on a shared “Cyberplug” interface + capability schema, the ecosystem would accelerate overnight:\n\n* less glue code\n* fewer breaking changes\n* more intelligent routing\n* cleaner open-source interop\n\nThat’s the whole idea, in three words:\n\n# discoverable, negotiated, and contained\n\nIf you’ve built something like this (or want to), I’d love to hear what patterns worked, what broke, and what you’d standardize first.",

        "content": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeRIRrfJt8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeRIRrfJt8A)\n\ni think i have some interesting views  share your opinions below if u like\n\nvideo script--\n\nThe Rizzsociety Manifesto Part 1 - AI Jobless & Smart UBI Capitalism\n\nhi my name is rizzsociety. i think mass AI jobloss has clearly started. Theres been mass layoffs of good paying jobs due to AI. And i think the notion of, oh new jobs will surely somehow be created, it wont be that bad. I think that is cope and not reality.\n\nI think the reality is theres going to be massively increasing poverty, homelessness, starvation, and economic collapse - until smart UBI happens. I think smart UBI is what society needs once you reach the technology age of AI and robots taking all the goodpaying jobs\n\nso now i have good news. and bad news.\n\nThe good news is. It does seem many in congress are suggesting some kind of UBI or massive welfare system will be needed to ultimately solve the AI jobloss problem. So at least, the politicians are on the right path.\n\nBut i guess the bad news is, government tends to work very slowly. So, i hope im wrong, but there could be alot of suffering and poverty until the lawmakers find solutions\n\nalso, a welfare state is basically UBI in a different name. if you get foodstamps and government housing, then thats like UBI. and america already has a big welfare state. So i think what might happen is,  congress will just greatly expand the welfare state, without doing actual UBI. That could solve the problems. if that happens, then we can avoid the mass homelessness and poverty problems, without doing \"real\" UBI\n\nBut i think a actual smart UBI system works better than a welfare state that tries to target benefits. So my goal, i guess, is for my smart UBI ideas to go viral and spread into society and congress, and if everyone likes my ideas then the government might do smart UBI\n\nI have been thinking for years of what are the best ways to design a smart UBI system for society. And i have created what i think is a good UBI system. If another politician thinks of a better UBI system, i would be happy to support it. But so far, my UBI system is the best UBI plan i have seen\n\nI call my ubi plan \"Smart UBI Capitalism\" . I think most smart people who learn my UBI plan will support it and think it sounds good.\n\nMy UBI plan is fast and easy to learn. it really is simple. I will detail it in part 2. its like 10 minutes to learn it fully.\n\nand i am aware. That its easy to think of a plan to give tons of free stuff to everyone. That part is easy. Its easy to \"spend other peoples money\" .\n\nThe hard part is how do you fund it all . what do you do when you \"run out of other peoples money\" .. and thats the main smart part of my economy plan. my plan is smart UBI, smart taxation, and smart labor draft concepts. I think the main parts that make my plan work good , is the simple taxation and labor draft concepts, that i think will allow everything to function and be funded properly. I explain it all in part 2\n\nBut I dont want each manifesto video to be too long, i plan to keep making these manifesto videos to slowly share all my politics . So if you really wanna take 10 minutes to learn how my UBI plan works, then you can watch part 2\n\non the topic of AI becoming sentient, super intelligent, and \"taking over\" and wiping out humans. I will not speak on that, because i just dont know how AI works, i dont know how possible self-aware AI truly is... I do think the definition of \"mind\" is to be \"self aware\", to be aware of yourself, and i think a truly self aware AI mind would also be uncontrollable, such a mind would by definition control itself. I think if it can be controlled, if we are its master, then its not actually self aware.. but i guess thats just my personal AI theory... Also, ive seen a few AI engineers say that AI might not even have to become \"self aware\" to reach a state where its internal reward-systems somehow allow it to, without even having a self-aware-mind , start to overpower humans and take over...\n\nHmm... I guess, we just gotta hope it all works out in the end...\n\nalso.. i guess.. i do believe in god.. and really when you think about it.. if god is real.. then wouldnt that mean he is ultimately in control anyway and when we die we just go to heaven anyway and we are all immortal and spiritually eternal so who really cares in the end about any of this AI crap? because no AI would ever be more powerful than god anyway right? heh heh.. i guess thats a interesting way to think about AI.. really, the question of AI is ultimately just a question of GOD... if god is real, then who cares about AI and if it \"takes over\", because we are all eternal spirits anyway, and it would mean god just wanted it to happen anyway...\n\nand if god ISNT real, then fuck, that means we face a certain death where our existence is forever deleted and we will never experience the pleasure of life ever again after we die... dayum.. i guess when you think about it like that, AI isnt even the big issue here, and the real issue is \"fuck, i hope god is real. because life truly does suck ass if god isnt real. i guess, none of us will ever know the answer to the god question. we live life, forever wondering, what happens after that final door of death\"\n\nanyway.. thats enough spiritual philosophy..\n\nIn my politics i will just assume a world where humans remain the masters, and we remain in control of AI. My politics is focused on smart UBI to fix the problems of mass AI jobloss\n\nI plan on running for congress soon myself. i figure, i think i have good ideas, so i may as well run for congress. i plan to spend no money on my campaign, my youtube will be my only advertising, and im just running to \"see what happens\".\n\nif everyone likes my ideas, then they can vote for me. I only think i will win if my ideas are so extremely popular that everyone likes it and votes for me. and Thats fine. if everyone likes my politics, they can vote for me\n\nAnd if i lose, then society can just solve its own problems\n\nI do think, that overall, there are tons of smart lawmakers in america and europe. so i think society will solve these AI problems in good time, even if i sit back and do nothing.\n\nSo i realize, i am not important, i am not significant, and the solutions will simply \"just happen naturally\" without me. i am not needed\n\nso then. with that said. Why am i even bothering doing any of this? why am i even making these manifesto videos if i believe the solutions will \"just happen naturally\" ?\n\ngood question. and so now, its time for me to say what this is really all about\n\ni do plan on running for congress, eventually. and i do plan to share my political ideology\n\nhowever, i guess the main thing i am REALLY trying to do with all this is . i am working to create a STREAMING EMPIRE OF ENTERTAINMENT, RIZZ, AND POLITICS\n\nits about you subscribing to my youtube and enjoying my kickass content that comes straight from the godking . me . i am the godking\n\nsubscribe to my youtube, and thats how you JOIN OUR EMPIRE and JOIN THE REVOLUTION OF ENTERTAINMENT, RIZZ , AND POLITICS\n\nits about LIVING LIFE BEFORE WE FUCKING DIE . its about the friends we make along the way. its about the journey . its about being entertained. i believe in god, and i guess, i think all this shiz is just a spiritual experience. we live, then we die, then we ascend to the spirit realm, or whatever\n\nits about HAVING FUN BABY. thats what my youtube is all about. i truly believe i have THE MOST KICKASS CONTENT ON YOUTUBE, so subscribe bitches if you want to witness THE REAL MUTHAFUKKING RIZZCONTENT OF THE GODS\n\ni am forging my new empire . a KICKASS DISCORD . a KICKASS REDDIT.  join our reddit r/RIZZSOCIETY . post your memes, have fun in our community, have fun in our NEW EMPIRE OF RIZZ\n\ni do think, my community is mostly for teenagers. young males. only people under age 25 will really find it fun to join my reddit and discord. and thats fine. teenagers are my target audience, your the ones watching streams and having fun in discords and shiz. if your under age 25, join my discord\n\nso now WITH ALL THAT SAID . there is actually a fast GAMEPLAN i have with all this. i will now say THE GAMEPLAN\n\nstep 1) i want you to ask yourself this question. do you ever watch any streamers, such as XQC or asmongold or tim pool . or anyone. do you watch any livestreamers\n\nstep 2) if you DO watch any livestreamers. then you are my target audience. you are someone that willingly gives your \"viewership power\" to someone else, making them get famous off your viewership. so i am asking you, comrade, to give your viewership power to me, and make me get famous, so i can return the favor and give you tons of that sweet government UBI money after i become supreme leader emperor .. ohh yeah\n\nwhen your in your free time and your gonna watch a streamer. check my youtube to see if im live. i plan to stream 8 hours a day. give your viewership power to me comrade, increase my power. grow the power of the godking. i must become ultra famous to gain ultra political power\n\nStep 3) also, i know most livestream viewers are probably teenagers that play videogames and just have the stream on \"in the background\" while playing games. and thats fine, that increases my viewcount . if thats you, thats good. play your games and have me on in the background\n\nstep4) and thats basically it. this is all about me trying to grow my youtube power, my fame power, my political power. life is just a game of trying to get famous, and most lose, but some win. and i guess, im just trying to \"win the game\" baby  .... ohh yeah\n\n......\n\nnow ill say fast the energy/vibe of my streams/content\n\nmy MANIFESTO VIDEOS are where i say my politics and philosophy. but, my STREAMS will actually be \"entertainment focused, very little politics\" . and heres why\n\ni believe my politics are so superior, that i only need to say it \"one time\" and thats it. i dont have to keep repeating my politics over and over on stream like hasan piker or asmongold. thats so boring. i dont know how people watch that garbage\n\nthats why my streams will be entertainment focused. and not politics focused.  while i am very political and i plan to run for politics, it is my MANIFESTO VIDEOS where you learn my politics.\n\nI just put my politics / philosophy in my manifesto videos “one time” , and then bam, im done.\n\nand then my fans can just watch my manifesto videos \"one time\" to learn my politics . and then after that, your done too.\n\nafter you learn my politics, then you can decide if you “like” watching my streams for entertainment. if you do, then cool.\n\nor if you dont like my streams, go watch someone else\n\ni stream just for my fans who like my content, who like my style, and its all just for fun\n\nalso my politics go far beyond UBI. but now when i think about it, i predict most people will really only care about my UBI politics. and they wont care about the other stuff. so i think i will only make a few manifesto videos, sharing just my UBI system and little more of my politics and philosophy, and then ill probably just do only streaming and food videos after that\n\ni guess. if you liked this video. and if you want to make me your new supreme leader. then comrade, you dont have to wait to worship me. you can start worshipping me right now. if you click that button subscribing to my youtube, then comrade, you can consider that to be you making the spiritual choice to join our new empire. to join our REVOLUTION OF ENTERTAINMENT, RIZZ, AND POLITICS . if you subscribe to my youtube. that means i am now. your new messiah. i am. your godking\n\nand were gonna kick. some serious ass.

        "content": "AI’s biggest flaw is hallucinations that we can detect and even worse, the ones we cannot detect. Removing the hallucinations from AI for now is very difficult because the human minds that created AI themselves put that mechanism in place. The human brain does hallucinate, and the AI algorithms mirror this because the human mind that created the artificial mind is itself hallucinant at times and not wholly rational. It also feeds on partly fallacious human data of all sorts which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy resulting in increased hallucination.\n\n\n\nI believe the ultimate limiting factor of AI’s efficacy - even greater so than storage and energy limitations - is the algorithm that holds the seed for hallucination and the consumption of fallacious data. Without a new algorithm, the AI race will be a race to the bottom that will drain earth's resources and put heavy strain on the world economy.\n\n\n\nWe need not more hardware and energy, we need a non-hallucinant algorithm. And all the current ones (hallucinant algorithms) are total failures which will become evident when ultimately the economies won’t be able to fund the massive corporations any longer without any profit in sight. \n\n\n\nAI race will be won by those who invest in the algorithm, those who invest in computing power, energy and infrastructure will go under.\n\n\n\nThe current AI is nothing but a more advanced textual search engine and a chat-bot. Linguistic symbols are ambiguous. Reducing linguistic symbolism to algorithms still caries this ambiguity over and thus the hallucinant character also.\n\n\n\nAnd the question for the non-hallucinant algorithm is: “What truly is consciousness and what is the hallucination of the subconscious?”. In other words, where lies the line of discernment between the two. And how do we implement a fully rational algorithm? Would this truly be possible? I think not. You can’t create something smarter than billions of years of evolution with a few decades of engineering and maths.\n\n\n\nComputers can never surpass human consciousness, especially a fully awakened consciousness unburdened by subconscious loops. Computers were invented to remove three human limitations: space occupied per data, physical work needed per calculation, time needed per distance to send data. So computers aren’t smarter than us, they cannot like Einstein or Newton uncover what hasn’t been uncovered yet. They just save us from these three physical limitations, which is why it “seems” to be smarter. No, it is just faster. Not more intelligent. It can automate mundane things that are exact mathematics, but we’ve had that since Alan Turing. It is nothing new.\n\n\n\nSo what really is going on here? Are we fed a lie? Is this the legal alibi for mass public and private data analysis to be used in even more authoritarian control?",

        "title": "\"better AI thinking\" (Reasoning) and \"AI control\" (Governance)?",
        "content": "We often confuse these concepts, but this is a crucial distinction for the future of AI. In short:\n\n* Reasoning = We teach the AI how to think. It's brain training.\n* Governance = We build mathematical cages and rules for the AI that it cannot break, regardless of what it thinks. It's designing a prison for that brain.\n\n# Part 1: Reasoning — We reduce errors, but we don't eliminate them\n\nWhen an AI \"hallucinates\" (makes up facts), we improve its thought process:\n\n* Chain-of-Thought: We make it \"show its work\" — generate reasoning steps.\n* Self-Critique: We make it criticize its own answer.\n* Better Training: We give it better data.\n\nThis is like training a super-specialist. You teach a doctor the best practices, critical thinking, and ethics. They will make fewer mistakes, but under extreme stress, with a new disease, they can still make an error. Reasoning reduces risk but does not guarantee safety. An AI is a complex statistical system — you cannot mathematically prove it will never hallucinate just by improving its thinking.\n\n# Part 2: Governance — Mathematical guarantees that work even if the AI \"goes mad\"\n\nThis is not about making the AI want to be safe. It's about making it physically incapable of being dangerous, even if it wanted to be. This is the level of system architecture and pure mathematics.\n\nExamples from real research:\n\n1. Constrained Decoding / Formal Verification: We don't trust the model's \"reasoning.\" We mathematically define the space of permissible outputs. It's like a GPS in a car with \"geofencing.\" The engine (reasoning) can run, but it is mathematically impossible to drive outside the designated area because the navigation system will physically cut the fuel. For an AI: the model generates text, but the governance layer absolutely blocks character sequences that violate the protocol (e.g., weapons instructions).\n2. Guardian Models / Monitors: We create a separate, narrow model whose only job is oversight. The main model (Agent) thinks and acts. The Guardian does not understand the task. It only continuously scans the Agent's inputs/outputs, looking for mathematical signatures of forbidden actions. Did it detect a violation? Immediate \"kill-switch.\" It's like a guard in a tower with a sniper rifle — they don't negotiate, don't consider intent, they only enforce the protocol.\n3. Cryptographic Commitments & Transparency Logs: When generating an answer, the AI must simultaneously create a mathematical \"proof\" or \"signature\" related to its actions (e.g., what data it used). Later, an auditor (or another system) can verify this. This is not the AI's reflection — it's a protocol-level enforceability requirement.\n\n# Why is this so important? Analogy: Pilot vs. Safety System\n\n* Reasoning = Training the best pilot in the world. They will avoid disasters.\n* Governance = A non-removable emergency autopilot and mechanical limiters. Even if the pilot (reasoning) makes a mistake, gets confused, or intentionally tries to crash the plane, the system (governance) will not let them do it. It will take control and land safely, or simply not allow a nosedive.\n\n# Summary:\n\n* The Question for Reasoning: \"Is your reasoning correct and free from hallucinations?\"\n* The Question for Governance: \"Even if your thought process fails or you act in bad faith, can you possibly cause real harm? Are there mechanical barriers that will stop you?\"\\*\n\nSafe superintelligence requires both: we must teach it to think as well as possible (reasoning), but simultaneously enclose it in an architecture that imposes impassable limits (governance). Work on governance is often boring mathematics and systems engineering, not spectacular model improvements. But it is precisely this work that is our last line of defense.\n\nWhat do you think? Does one of these paths seem more promising/credible to you? Do you have examples of specific projects going in either direction?",

The Stack: They glue together existing tools and charge a monthly retainer + setup fee.\n\nWhy this wins:\n\n* No Dev Cost: You aren't hiring 5 engineers to build a custom model.\n* Stickiness: Once you integrate into their phone lines or CRM, they never leave you.\n* Feedback Loop: You learn the actual problems which gives you an idea for a real SaaS product later.\n\nA good overview in this guide of how startups are applying AI in very practical, revenue-driven ways helped validate this trend for me: [AI use cases from startups ](https://www.netcomlearning.com/blog/ai-use-cases-startups-transforming-business)\n\nIs anyone else pivoting from \"Pure SaaS\" to \"Tech-Enabled Services\"?

One thing that surprised us early on - hallucinations are way more insidious than simple bugs.\n\nRegular software bugs are binary. Either the code works or it doesn't. But agents hallucinate with full confidence. They'll invent statistics, cite non-existent sources, contradict themselves across turns, and sound completely authoritative doing it.\n\nWe built multi-level detection because hallucinations show up differently depending on where you look. Sometimes it's a single span (like a bad retrieval step). Sometimes it's across an entire conversation where context drifts and the agent starts making stuff up.\n\nThe evaluation approach we landed on combines a few things - faithfulness checks (is the response grounded in retrieved docs?), consistency validation (does it contradict itself?), and context precision (are we even pulling relevant information?). Also PII detection since agents love to accidentally leak sensitive data.\n\nPre-production simulation has been critical. We run agents through hundreds of scenarios with different personas before they touch real users. Catches a lot of edge cases where the agent works fine for 3 turns then completely hallucinates by turn 5.\n\nIn production, we run automated evals continuously on a sample of traffic. Set thresholds, get alerts when hallucination rates spike. Way better than waiting for user complaints.\n\nHardest part has been making the evals actually useful and not just noisy. Anyone can flag everything as a potential hallucination, but then you're drowning in false positives.\n\nNot trying to advertise but just eager to know how others are handling this in different setups and what other tools/frameworks/platforms are folks using for hallucination detection for production agents :)",

        "title": "Architecting Autonomy: Modern Design Patterns for AI Assistants",
        "content": "In the early days of generative AI, an \"assistant\" was little more than a text box waiting for a prompt. You typed, the model predicted, and you hoped for the best. But as we move deeper into 2026, the industry has shifted from simple chatbots to sophisticated **Agentic Systems**.^(1)\n\n\n\nThe difference lies in **Design Patterns**. Just as the software industry matured through the adoption of MVC (Model-View-Controller) or Microservices, the AI space is now formalizing the blueprints that make assistants reliable, safe, and truly autonomous.\n\nHere are the essential design patterns shaping the next generation of AI assistants.\n\n# 1. The \"Plan-Then-Execute\" Pattern\n\nEarly assistants often \"hallucinated\" because they began writing an answer before they had a full strategy. The **Plan-Then-Execute** pattern (often implemented as *Reason-and-Act* or ReAct) forces the assistant to pause.\n\nWhen a user asks a complex question—like \"Analyze our Q3 spending and find three areas for cost reduction\"—the assistant doesn't start typing the report. Instead, it creates a **Task Decomposition** tree:\n\n1. Access the financial database.\n2. Filter for Q3 transactions.\n3. Categorize expenses.\n4. Run a comparison against Q2.\n\nBy separating the \"thinking\" (planning) from the \"doing\" (execution), assistants become significantly more accurate and can handle multi-step workflows without losing the thread.\n\n# 2. The \"Reflective\" Pattern (Self-Correction)2\n\nEven the best models make mistakes. The **Reflection Pattern** introduces a secondary \"Critic\" loop. In this architecture, the assistant generates an initial output, but before the user sees it, the system passes that output back to itself (or a specialized \"Verifier\" model) with a prompt: *\"Check this response for factual errors or compliance violations.\"*\n\nIf the Verifier finds a mistake, the assistant iterates. This design pattern is the backbone of **Safe AI**, ensuring that \"Shadow AI\" behaviors—like leaking internal PII or hallucinating legal clauses—are caught in a private, internal loop before they ever reach the user interface.\n\n# 3. The \"Human-in-the-Loop\" (HITL) Gateway\n\nAs AI assistants move into high-stakes environments like M&A due diligence or medical reporting, total autonomy is often a liability. The **HITL Gateway** pattern creates mandatory \"checkpoints.\"\n\nRather than the AI executing a wire transfer or finalizing a contract, the pattern requires the assistant to present a **Draft & Justification**.\n\n* **The Draft:** The proposed action.\n* **The Justification:** A \"chain-of-thought\" explanation of *why* it chose this action.\n\nThe human acts as the final \"gatekeeper,\" clicking \"Approve\" or \"Edit\" before the agent proceeds.^(3) This builds trust and ensures accountability in regulated industries.\n\n\n\n# 4. The Multi-Agent Orchestration (Swarm) Pattern\n\nThe most powerful assistants today aren't single models; they are **teams**. In the **Orchestration Pattern**, a \"Manager Agent\" receives the user's request and delegates sub-tasks to specialized \"Worker Agents.\"^(4)\n\n\n\nFor example, a Legal Assistant might consist of:\n\n* **The Researcher:** Specialized in searching internal document silos (Vectorization/RAG).\n* **The Writer:** Specialized in drafting compliant prose.\n* **The Auditor:** A high-precision model trained specifically on SEC or GDPR guidelines.\n\nThis modular approach allows developers to \"swap\" out the Researcher or Auditor as new, better models become available without rebuilding the entire system.\n\n# 5. The \"Context-Aware Memory\" Pattern\n\nStandard LLMs are \"stateless\"—they forget who you are the moment the chat ends. Modern assistants use a **Stateful Memory Pattern**. This involves two layers:\n\n1. **Short-Term Memory:** Current session context (stored in the prompt window).\n2. **Long-Term Memory:** User preferences, past projects, and \"Local Data\" (stored in a Vector Database).\n\nBy using **Vectorization** to index a user’s history, the assistant can recall that \"Project X\" refers to the merger discussed three months ago, providing a seamless, personalized experience that feels like a real partnership.\n\n# The Future: Zero-Trust Design\n\nAs we look toward the end of 2026, the \"Golden Pattern\" is becoming **Zero-Trust AI Architecture**. This pattern assumes that even the model cannot be fully trusted with raw data. It utilizes local redaction agents to scrub sensitive information *before* the planning and execution loops begin.\n\nBy implementing these patterns, organizations can move past the \"experimental\" phase of AI and build robust, enterprise-grade tools that don't just chat, but actually solve problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "transcription": "The CEO of one of the major AI labs predicted last year that by around now, 100 percent of the code written by that company would be produced by one of their AI models.\nDario Amodei, March 2025.\nNext up, within 2026, would be all other knowledge work. And a new tool released by Anthropic in the last couple of days seems to back that up. It's called Claude Cowork.\nNot only has it gone omega viral at 42 million views for its ability to automate non-coding tasks, the tool itself was produced within Claude Code, powered by their latest frontier model, Claude Opus 4.5. Thereby seeming to justify the prediction that essentially all of the code would by now be written by AI.\nSo wait, if they got that right, does that mean that Anthropic and those like Sholto Douglas are correct when they say that in 2026, this year, the same will be true of automating all white collar work.\nThe most striking thing about next year is that the other forms of knowledge work are going to experience what software engineers are feeling right now, where they went from typing, you know, most of their lines of code at the beginning of the year to typing barely any of them at the end of the year. I think of this as the Claude code experience but for all forms of knowledge work. I also think that probably continue your learning gets solved in a satisfying way.\nWell, I've been using Claude Code for quite a while, and yes, have been playing about with the new Claude Cowork. And for me, those predictions are just not true. But so many of us might then throw the baby out with the bath water and miss out on some pretty crazy productivity gains. So I'm going to show why we shouldn't underestimate the gains to be had either.\nThen, for those who want to go a bit deeper, I'm going to end with the why. Why can models produce genius like seeing tiny bugs in large code bases and writing for me powerful poems, but also still fail at such basic tasks. No, I don't mean how many 'A's in the word orange, although surprisingly GPT 5.2 still can't get that right. No, I mean why are they still sometimes so brittle, memorizing that Tom Smith's wife is Mary Stone, but not deducing that Mary Stone's husband is Tom Smith?\nAnd what does any of this mean for your job, white collar or otherwise? What is the latest data show? First, of course, a quick word on Claude Cowork, which inevitably, it seems, some people are calling AGI. This, of course, follows numerous viral posts and articles about the underlying model, Claude Opus 4.5, when given the right scaffold, already being AGI. Indeed, a long list of notable commentators have this perspective. These posts can lead, of course, to two very disparate reactions, both of which I'd advise against. One, that it's all BS, all hype merchants, these tools hallucinate all the time and are pretty much useless. And second, that they are AGI perhaps, and I, you, are just missing out. We can't understand how to use them. We're missing out so much, our careers are doomed. This video is hopefully going to channel you down the middle path, which is you can get great productivity gains, but they're not there yet.\nFor context, I've been using Claude Code for a very long time, and Cowork for the last 48 hours.\n[On-screen interaction with Claude Cowork]\nUser: Summarize my meetings from this week and find action items. Where do you think I can be more efficient?\n[User selects \"Meeting Transcripts\" folder, clicks \"Let's go\".]\nClaude: I'll take a look through these now. One quick question- How detailed do you want this?\n[User selects \"Detailed notes\".]\nClaude: Build... Building plan... Progress. Read meeting recordings, Pull out key points, Find action items, Write summary.\n[Claude proceeds through tasks, opens Google Calendar, shows files like \"Meeting Transcripts,\" \"SKILL.md,\" \"pptx-patterns.md,\" \"css.md,\" \"claude in chrome\". Shows artifacts: \"Meeting summaries,\" \"Action items,\" \"Team standup deck\".]\n[Claude displays \"Product Team Standup\" presentation with key highlights, features, user interviews, latency improvements.]\nTo slightly debunk the hype point. If I gave a new employee this task: \"Make a comparison chart for Stockport FC's league position at this date, today, for each of the last 5 seasons, add it as a pptx to my desktop, with web-sourced relevant images. Ask any clarifying questions and share a plan of how you'll approach this task.\" I would expect, and let me know if you agree or not, for them to either say at the end of the day, \"I couldn't find any source to give definitive answers on that question,\" or to have produced the relevant PowerPoint. Now you can see the Cowork tab here and the kind of questions it lays out, and it does indeed give a great plan. I approved it immediately, and it didn't even take that long to be honest.\nThe result, I would say, was visually quite impressive and pretty much acceptable. Obviously, you have to pick a moderately hard task, because if it's too easy, you just do it yourself. So this was the result. Slight problem, I checked two of the dates it gave me for January 2023 and 2025 and the league position of this club, and both were incorrect. I manually checked, and within about 5 minutes, I found two other data sources, BBC and this site, 11v11, both of which said that Stockport were seventh at the time, not third for January 13th, 2025. This Coworking AGI, by the way, did not caveat its results in its summary to me that it couldn't find a reliable source either.\nNow, I could, of course, give you hundreds of such examples from the legendary Claude Code, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. But that wouldn't be too interesting or fair on you because you'd have to see the whole context of the code base. I just don't want you guys to walk away from these viral posts thinking, unless I spend all my money and keep up with a tool released just last week, I'm going to completely fail at my white-collar job. And if the models make any mistakes, I'm the dumb one, I must have done something wrong. But I don't want you to make the opposite mistake, which is to completely ignore these tools and think that they can't boost your productivity at all. The truth lies somewhere in the middle, and look, even the lead developer for Claude Code said as much later on in a reply, after saying \"All of it\", for the code for Claude Cowork was written by Claude Opus 4.5. He clarified, \"It was not zero intervention! We had to plan, design, and go back and forth with Claude. Claude wrote all the code.\"\nWhich then, for my super smart audience, leads to a key question, well, is it faster to get Claude Code to do the draft, and then redraft, and then test, fail, redraft, and then kind of get it right, or for the human to just do it themselves from scratch, whether it be coding or just other white collar work? Thankfully, we have a key clue from this OpenAI paper from October of 2025. Using blind human grading, we have already passed that tipping point. We get more of a productivity multiplier by getting models to try again and again and again and the human to just step in, review and edit, than from the human just doing it themselves. This GDPVal paper covers dozens of white-collar industries, and I did an entire video on it, so I'm not going to go into too much depth, but that for me is the real tipping point. And yes, I've experienced that in my own coding, which I do almost every day. It makes a bunch of dumb and sometimes dangerous mistakes, but don't throw the baby out with the bath water.\nEven take my Stockport PowerPoint. It's really quite well designed and almost all the other facts are true, so I could just edit a couple of the numbers and have a decent presentation in less time than creating it myself from scratch. Quick bit of technical detail, Claude Cowork is only available on the max tier, minimum 90 pounds or 100 dollars, and on Macs only. That's Mac OS, not Max, Mac OS, not Windows, but also Max only, not the Pro tier of Claude. Notice this productivity speed up though, is only true for a certain number of the latest models, those most likely to be tried by enthusiasts like us, less so the general population, and also that those models like GPT-5.2 Pro or 4.5 Opus are also gated heavily by price. If we are right about that tipping point, and about how few people are using the latest models with the best scaffolds, then you'd expect the current AI impact on productivity and the labor market to be relatively limited. And what does the data show? According to this January 7th, 2026 report from the widely cited Oxford Economics, well, to me, it shows exactly that. Yes, new graduates face slightly higher unemployment, but that isn't out of line with other historical trends. If you're listening to this, the new graduate unemployment rate has been much higher in the quite recent past, like 2015 or 2010. The authors know, if you zoom in on this graph, there's actually been a slight downward trend from March to September of last year. The authors say, \"We don't expect AI to significantly raise the joblessness rate in the US or elsewhere over the next year or two.\" That doesn't mean that there hasn't been any human job impact from AI, even causal impact. For example, sectors where there are potentially the most easy wins from AI adoption have a greater incentive to put the new technology to the test. Think of customer service operations and companies like Klanar. To finance this, they go on, budgets for the other parts of the business, including wages, may have to be cut. Fine, but what about the numerous headlines of mass job layoffs or a job apocalypse imminent? Well, the authors say, \"If AI is already leading to mass layoffs of obsolete workers, then it also stands to reason that measures of labor productivity should be increasing as the same output is produced with fewer workers.\" There are lots of cyclical factors that affect productivity, but if you focus on 2025 in teal, I'm color blind, but I think that's teal. You can see that it's not markedly higher in terms of labor productivity per hour growth than in previous years or periods. In fact, productivity growth in 2025 looks smaller than that for, say, 2000 to 2007 in every period. Why would so many companies proclaim that they're cutting jobs due to AI then? Well, the authors say, \"Linking job losses to increased AI usage rather than other negative factors like weak demand or excessive hiring in the past conveys a more positive message to investors.\" I think when a lot of companies and individuals discover just how much LLMs hallucinate, the initial wave of adoption and testing kind of petered out toward the middle of last year, but there has been a more recent uptick. People are, of course, starting to compare different models for their use case. As the CEO of Google DeepMind, Demis Hassabis said, \"making relentless progress,\" pointing to the fact that ChatGPT's share of generative AI is falling fairly notably. That's the thesis, of course, behind the app that I designed, LMCouncil.ai, where you can compare the answers of all the frontier models in a nice and customizable format. Indeed, even getting models to chat amongst themselves has proven so popular a feature here that I've produced a shortcut, where with semicolon, you can kickstart a self-chat amongst the models.\nBy the way, if I saw mass job layoffs coming, I would totally warn you guys as much as I could. But I'm less on the Dario Amodei side of things. I'm more on the Jensen Huang side of things, where he recently said in an interview a couple of days ago, \"Don't mistake the purpose of a job for the series of individually automatable tasks within that job.\" Take a football commentator. You could automate the voice of that commentator. You could automate the tactical analysis done by that commentator. You could do it all faster and cheaper, but the ultimate purpose, you could say, of a football commentator is to entertain you while you're watching, keep you engaged with the game. And that purpose might not be best served by an AI model. And that missing the wood for the trees is why we're going to turn to the second part of this video. The why behind the models being brittle in certain circumstances. Why do they seem 200 IQ one moment and 50 IQ another? This week I've been reading a series of papers on that topic, and probably my favorite is this one from just, what is that? Six days ago. I will note that if you are the kind of person drawn to the why's behind LLMs, I do have a quick word about our sponsor. And that is the MATS program, with a deadline of just four days from now for applications to their summer 2026 program. As you might know, MATS finds and trains researchers working on possibly one of the most talent constrained problems in the world, which is reducing risks from unaligned AI models. You might be familiar with them because their alumni have gone on to work at places like Meta, Anthropic, DeepMind, and of course, many other places. As you might expect, given it meets my standards for a recommendation, the program also comes with world-class mentorship, a stipend, compute budget, and full cost coverage. Do check out my link in the description.\nSo back to the specific question of why LLMs can seem so brittle. Navigating incredibly complex code bases to pick out a minuscule bug, but then sometimes Claude Cowork, going along merrily and deleting 11 gigabytes of files randomly from a guy's desktop, according to one user from two days ago. Why do they do that? Well, in short, because there are multiple levels of \"understanding\" in large language models. First though, I'm going to give you a freaky thought. We don't even know what the word understand means in English. Like we know what it denotes, but what are we under? If the under prefix isn't the usual meaning \"beneath,\" but from Old English under, from PIE inter- \"between, among\" (source also of Sanskrit antar \"among, between,\" Latin inter \"between, among,\" Greek entero \"intestines,\" see inter-). Related: Understood; understanding. The best guess of the etymology of the word understand seems to be to be between or among the ideas. In the presence, connected to something rather than being distant. Again, though, it seems like early humans didn't fully grok or understand what understanding meant, like being in the presence of something. And even synonyms like comprehend means to essentially grasp something. But why would holding something or grasping it mean you get it logically, intellectually? But then the etymology of the word intelligence is to pick between things. So it's no wonder that if we have this cloud of notions about standing in the presence of something, picking between things, having a grasp on things, that essentially if we don't have a fully intuitive definition of understanding, that we would struggle to ascribe understanding to LLMs. In this paper from Beckmann and Queloz, they give three categories of understanding. Simple conceptual understanding, just registering that there are connections between diverse manifestations of an entity. That's it, just finding connections between two things. Then, second stage, state-of-the-world or contingent understanding. These things being true or connected only in certain circumstances at certain times. Then the ultimate, what I've described in other videos as efficiently deriving new functions. That's principled understanding. The ability to grasp the underlying principles or rules that unify a diverse array of facts. If you don't have much time, the TLDR from this paper is that LLMs possess understanding distributed across a motley mix of mechanisms across all three tiers. They don't, in a sense, aspire to simplicity or parsimony. They just learn whatever connection, brittle or deeply algorithmic, that will get the job done. They can reach that third stage of understanding, deriving deep algorithms and patterns from the world. They can grok how to do addition and therefore delete the memorized pairs of what this plus this adds up to. And they plan ahead with poems. On the token before a new line of a poem starts, there is a circuit within Claude already planning what the rhyme will be and the semantics needed to achieve that rhyme. Researchers have found computable circuits for numerical comparison, multiple choice question answering. And even as I discussed in the autumn of last year, circuits for recognizing that introspection is called for. Given that these circuits are well defined and reusable, who are we to say that they haven't understood the concept? But here's the thing. LLMs also rely on brittle memorization. They pragmatically toggle between modeling the state of the world and relying on the shallow heuristics or rules of thumb, depending on which circuit minimizes loss most efficiently. They're kind of like a lazy bright kid who sometimes forces themselves to properly learn the material, and other times just memorizes what they need. The fact that they sometimes use memorization though, does, as the authors note, undermine the basis for epistemic trust. When they got something right, did they rely on that unifying mechanism, or merely a swarm of shallow heuristics? Of course, cognitive psychology also points to the fact that humans do the same, sometimes relying on shortcuts, saying or doing the first thing that comes to their mind on a local or international stage. Other humans try to double check those heuristics and think deeply about problems. So when you speak to an LLM, the authors know, it's a bit like speaking to a gigantic committee of drastically varying expertise. Higher-quality circuits are sometimes reinforced, but sometimes also drowned out by lower-quality circuits. Remember, these are alien intelligences, doing whatever they can, the easy way or the hard way to predict the next word or token. To a human, the sentence Tom Smith's wife is Mary is an embodied concept. It has dozens and dozens of connotations, not least that Mary's husband is Tom. For an LLM, the first time they hear Tom Smith's wife is Mary, that just updates their weights as to predicting what comes after in the future, Tom Smith's wife is, or maybe permutations like the wife of Tom Smith is. They haven't bound those concepts together. So they've got no reason to believe that the sentence Mary Stone's husband is will end with Tom. Now, as various other papers discuss, this particular weakness can be solved through data augmentation. But that's not my point. My point is that LLMs can understand things at a very deep level, and also simultaneously at a very shallow level. There is mixed evidence that reinforcement learning can strengthen those higher circuits, if you will. But this and other papers show that once an LLM has learned enough to get the question right most of the time, it has, with current methods, much less incentive to learn even higher circuits to get it right even more often. We are, though, exploring an alien landscape. There could well be a breakthrough a month from now, two months from now, wherein we incentivize models to reach much higher planes of understanding. For this paper, that could be achieved by encouraging models to reach that state of almost confusion. That's when multiple avenues can be explored most productively. And what levels of understanding could they reach if they're trained on a diverse range of new modalities? The American government is giving AI labs access to a dozen national laboratories from the US. And that's before we even get to hybrid architectures that have proven their worth with, for example, weather forecasting. Anyway, this video is getting too long. The point is to leave you somewhere between those two extremes. You're not alone if AI models constantly make mistakes on your workflow, nor, though, would it be fair to say that they're all hype. For me, maximal understanding of them and productivity using them comes from that place in the middle. Thank you so much for watching and have a wonderful day."

Because a unified Germany would eclipse theirs economically. They didn't want that to happen. Francois Mitterrand, who is the President of France, and Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of Britain, were against German unification. They knew it would marginalize their own country. Francois Mitterrand eventually found solace in expanding the European community to the European Union, but Margaret Thatcher just plain lost. She was just upset about the whole thing. She said Germany will be the Japan of Europe, and worse than Japan. I guess she hadn't been to Japan lately. She said the Germans will get in peace, what Hitler couldn't get in war. And she wanted to leave Red Army troops in Germany for the duration. Imagine if that had been the case. And now dealing with Putin. If he had troops in Germany, WATCH HERE we would be in trouble."
