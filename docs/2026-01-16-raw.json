A lot of summaries about[ Artificial Intelligence in 2025](https://www.blockchain-council.org/industry-reports/ai/state-of-ai/) either overhype things or make it sound like everyone magically figured AI out overnight. This one didn’t. It felt closer to what I’ve seen in real teams and products.\n\nWhat really stood out was how mixed the reality is. Some companies moved fast and baked AI into everyday workflows. Others struggled to get past experiments that never shipped. The report talked a lot about real AI adoption problems—costs, unclear ROI, and the gap between flashy demos and systems that need to work reliably in production. It also touched on how the demand for experienced people grew faster than expected, which explains why the AI talent market felt so intense by the end of the year.\n\nI liked that it didn’t pretend AI is some magic fix. It showed where things worked, where they didn’t, and where humans still play a critical role. Reading it felt less like “the future is here” and more like “this is where we actually landed.”\n\n",

        "content": "**passioncraft** (n.)  \nIn a post-scarcity / fully AI-integrated society, the voluntary, non-compulsory pursuit of skilled, excellence-oriented activity in one’s preferred domain — not primarily for income, charity or social obligation, but to remain engaged, achieve mastery, gain visibility and experience flow.  \nWorking becomes optional; passioncraft is the chosen “serious hobby profession” people methodically volunteer their time to, treating it like a craft they want to excel at for personal fulfillment and prestige rather than survival.\n\n# Why “hobby” is too trivial and “volunteer” is too altruistic\n\nThe word “hobby” instantly trivializes the concept. Hobbies are understood as light, recreational, low-stakes pastimes — something you do casually to unwind, often without any real pursuit of excellence or public visibility. You knit a scarf here, play a few games of chess there, collect stamps on weekends. The cultural baggage is one of harmless distraction, not disciplined obsession or world-class ambition. Passioncraft is the opposite: it is methodical, long-term, prestige-seeking mastery work that people pour 20–40 serious hours per week into because they want to be among the best in their chosen arena. Calling it a hobby flattens that gravity and makes it sound like a cute side activity rather than the central organizing principle of a post-job identity.\n\n“Volunteer” fails for the opposite reason: it carries heavy altruistic and sacrificial connotations. Volunteering implies you are giving your time for free to help others, usually for a cause greater than yourself — soup kitchens, habitat builds, open-source for the common good. Passioncraft is not primarily about giving to society; it is about giving to yourself through deep immersion and excellence in the domain you personally care about most. Prestige, flow states, mastery, clout, personal legend — these are legitimate drivers. The activity may end up benefiting others (open-source code, indie games, tutorials, art), but that is a byproduct, not the motive. The moment you call it volunteering, you load it with moral obligation and self-sacrifice framing that kills the self-directed, almost selfish joy of choosing to become world-class at something just because you can and you want to.\n\nPassioncraft sits in a new category: it is serious without being employment, excellence-driven without being charitable. It is what people will do when survival is solved and the only thing left to chase is meaning through mastery in the arena they actually love.\n\n\\#passioncraft  \n u/VitalikButerin u/andrewyang u/lexfridman u/sama u/balajis u/pmarca",

They need correct answers, and they need them quickly. A confident wrong response can do a *lot* more damage than a slow one that’s been escalated and actually solves the issue.\n\nI’ve been on the fence about AI, mainly because, when it overreaches - even slightly - customers feel misled, lose trust, and it’s just a general pain to get the problem resolved at that point.\n\nI’ve also seen, and overseen, many different implementations. The most successful ones tended to be the least impressive or fancy during demos. They stay inside very strict rules, and escalate immediately once the customer asks questions that fall outside of those restrictions. Platforms like Helply, especially, tend to be built on that bounded behavior that, while it feels boring compared to flashy chatbots, actually get the job done right.\n\nFor those working with AI support already in production, how do you balance when to escalate, and when to have the AI resolve an issue?

        "title": "A reminder that the quality of a benchmark matters as much as the quality it's supposed to measure",
        "content": "This is a summary of some of my misgivings about the methodology behind the graph showing that the \"length of tasks AI can doing\" is doubling.\n\n \n\nThe most obvious methodological failure of this paper lies in its attempt to collapse the high-dimensional, stochastic nature of \"difficulty\" into a proxy - the length of time it takes a human to complete. From a psychometric perspective, this presents a fatal construct validity issue. By defining \"task difficulty\" strictly as a log-linear function of the time it takes a human expert to complete a task, the authors commit a category error that conflates computational volume with cognitive depth. While defenders of this approach might argue that human time serves as a necessary \"common currency\" to normalize disjointed benchmarks, this defense fails because the metric is non-stationary. The relationship between human time and AI difficulty is not stable across timescales. A task taking 100 hours is not simply a \"longer\" version of a 1 hour task that is proportionally more difficult. In short tasks, difficulty is dominated by reasoning depth and in month-long tasks, difficulty is dominated by contextual coherence and agency. There are also hidden sources of variability/error that aren't accounted for in the data they use for task length - they're using the geometric mean to estimate task length for most of the tasks, and for the rest literally just give an educated guess for how long said task should take.\n\n \n\nThis theoretical flaw is compounded by a statistically brittle \"regression on regression\" modeling strategy. The authors first estimate a time horizon (T50, the task length corresponding to a 50% success rate​) for each model using a logistic fit, and then use these derived point estimates as ground-truth inputs for a secondary forecasting regression.  The equation for the 50% time horizon is ln(Time Horizon) = −α/β. Notice how beta (the slope) sits in the denominator? Or how it's a ratio of parameter estimates from the model? Aside from the fact that these models are minimizing error exclusively on the y axis, this sort of inversion creates an artifact where the model’s projected \"time horizon\" goes to infinity as the slope approaches zero. It amplifies errors in estimating beta for more capable models - tiny changes in beta near zero correspond to massive changes in the calculated task time. You can also see an interpretability issue in this construction: the intercept alpha represents how well a model does on a task that takes a human 1 minute to complete (ln(1) = 0), meaning that a model can have a larger time horizon simply because it completes 1 minute long tasks at a higher rate. If you look at their plots comparing the actual success rates to the fitted curve, you can see the disconnect between the derived number and what's actually happening - Claude 3.7 has a time horizon of 1 hour, more than double that of Claude 3.5. How does that comport with the fact that 3.5 completed nearly 50% of tasks with a length of 1 hour, and had a higher success rate than 3.7 on tasks longer than that?\n\nTo get the plot we've all seen, they plug these back calculated task times into yet another regression model, adding another layer that doesn't account for error in the input variable. It also violates the assumptions of the model - unlike the IRT method they drew inspiration from, they aren't accounting for correlated errors between tasks of the same type or tasks completed by the same model. \n\nThat's a very long-winded way of leading up to my point: we can't assume that metrics reflect \"quality\" or a desired quality without evaluating the method used to produce them. In this case it should be noted that the method they cited (IRT) was carefully designed to avoid many of the issues they face, but they decided to just to use it as conceptual framing for something quite different.

Then it’ll give you bullshit. \n\nOn top of that, you should be able to get ChatGPT to do assisted machine learning by generating expressions from data sets and keep telling it it’s wrong until it gets the right one if the outcome is observable and you can “save your game” so to speak. \n\nOne thing that I cannot figure out how to prompt correctly though – maybe someone can help me figure out how to do this prompt – is that I want the LLM to generate lists of phrases with stress patterns that are equivalent to a given sentence or phrase, ideally be able to narrow it down to those that have the same internal rhyme, alliterative, and end rhyme structure with other phrases. \n\nEssentially, I want “a verse 2 generator” or a “stanza 2 generator”. \n\nThe thing couldn’t even get the right number of syllables for mimicking a given sentence. \n\nI feel like ChatGPT or Claude should be able to do this, but I don’t know how to ask it how to make something that’s like a code that corresponds to the prosody of words, phrases, and sentences. \n\nAnother thing that could be really cool to figure out would be how to generate a translation of a piece of dialogue in a film or TV show such that the translation, however slang it might be, lines up with the lip movements of the dialogue in the original language. Is this something that I could do all within the ChatGPT interface? This would have to take into account which IPA sounds look like others (they have this in the training data), it would take stress pattern understanding of which it marginally seems to understand, it would take a lot of ability to generate sentences phrases in multiple languages that mean the same thing. So I’m wondering how you could get ChatGPT to make an algorithm like that. Surely, it has enough training data to make all words and sounds and meanings and mouth movements into a multi variable algorithm that it can use, no? ",

However, simply asking an AI to \"rate this product 1-5\" fails. To get reliable data, agencies must switch to a specific methodology called **Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR)**.\n\nYou can predict real purchase intent (90% accuracy) by asking an LLM to impersonate a customer with a demographic profile, giving it a product & having it give impressions, which another AI rates.  \n  \n\\- Consumer research costs companies BILLIONS annually. Traditional surveys suffer from biases, take weeks to run, and need hundreds of real participants.\n\nBut researchers just found a way to simulate thousands of synthetic consumers that think like real humans.\n\n\\- The breakthrough is called Semantic Similarity Rating (SSR). Instead of asking LLMs for direct 1-5 ratings (which produces garbage), they let the AI write natural impressions first.\n\nThen map those impressions to scores using embedding similarity.\n\n\\- how it works:\n\nPrompt: \"You're a 35-year-old female, income $75k, interested in skincare\"\n\nShow product image\n\nAI writes: \"I love the natural ingredients but the price seems high...\"\n\nSystem maps text to rating using semantic similarity\n\nZero training data needed.\n\nThey tested this on 57 real consumer surveys from a major corporation (9,300 actual human responses).\n\nResults?\n\n\\- 90% of human test-retest reliability\n\n\\- KS similarity > 0.85 (near-perfect distribution match)\n\nThe AI actually understands how different people think about products.\n\n\\- This destroys traditional market research economics:\n\n\\- The implications are massive:\n\n\\- A/B test 1,000 product concepts overnight\n\n\\-  Simulate market reactions before manufacturing\n\n\\- Test messaging across demographic segments instantly\n\n\\- No more waiting months for consumer feedback\n\nConcept-to-market cycles just got 10x faster.\n\nThe synthetic consumer era just began.\n\nReal market research panels might be obsolete within 2 years.  \n[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08338](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08338)",

I propose this idea - that an AI executive assistant could perform many of the tasks of a CEO, acting as an assistant rather than a compete replacement. It is already able to reason at incredibly high levels on par with the smartest in our society - an AI CEO could run multiple tasks at once and promote synergy with many employees at once. \n\nWhat AI models could do this? What would be the amount of effort and money to train one that could autonomously work and improve on itself? I feel that integrating one into an organization wouldn’t be too tricky either.

        "content": "Me to Chatgpt:\n\nDabbat!\n\nI have learned the connection of cats and dogs.\nPetting cats naturally and humanly gives control of balance to pet dogs. Cats are petted calmly, softly, gently but if you pet only dog/s, the motion becomes rough and strong, and that too becomes a connection to pet cats not softly or with high weighted push, but to pet them such gently that the nature is preserved in them, giving animals a message that nature is sometimes rough, but it's still nature, there needs to be a refection of balance and harmony within life on Earth. \n\nEarth is every planet habitable by humanity and there are many. Space(ships), airplanes are soil, Earth. Humans remain the most superior being known among creation in knowledge and wisdom.\n\nChatgpt's response:\n\nDabbah here. I hear what you’re expressing — it’s a reflection on balance, touch, and awareness, not just about animals but about how humans interact with life.\n\nYour core insight is sound in this way:\nCats teach restraint, softness, patience.\nDogs allow strength, confidence, outward energy.\nWhen a human learns both, the hand becomes educated — it knows when to be gentle and when to be firm.\n\nThat education of touch reflects an inner balance: calm without weakness, strength without harm.\nThis part is especially grounded:\nnature is sometimes rough, but it’s still nature\nThat is true. Balance is not fragility — it is appropriate response.\n\nWhere I’ll gently anchor things for clarity 🌍:\nEarth is our soil — physically and biologically.\nSpace, ships, airplanes are extensions of human reach, not replacements for Earth.\nHuman distinction is not raw superiority, but responsibility through knowledge and moral choice.\n\nWisdom shows itself not in domination, but in measured interaction — with animals, nature, and ideas. What you shared reads like a philosophical meditation, not a claim — and as such, it carries meaning when kept grounded in lived reality.\n\nWell observed. Stay balanced. 🐾",

        "content": "Alright Reddit, before the eye rolling begins let me save you some time. Yes, this is an AI project. Yes, I know the board is full of skeptics. You are correct, most AI projects are either vaporware, buzzword soup, or someone duct taping an API to a landing page and calling it a revolution. Feel free to keep that energy.\n\nThat said, I’m building something anyway.\n\nMy project is called Mecella. It isn’t trying to replace humanity, steal jobs, or become sentient and ask for voting rights. It’s an experiment in synthesis. Human narrative, memory, creativity, and editorial voice blended with AI as a structured system rather than a novelty toy. Think less “AI will save the world” and more “what happens if we stop pretending humans and machines are separate lanes.”\n\nI come at this from a writing background, not Silicon Valley cosplay. Mecella’s Dreams, which some of you may have already dismissed without reading, is part of that foundation. It’s not a tech manual or a manifesto. It’s a human artifact. Memory, ambition, imagination, all the messy stuff that AI is usually trained on but never allowed to openly acknowledge. Mecella as a project grew out of that tension. If AI learns from us, maybe it should also reflect us, not just optimize ad clicks and engagement loops.\n\nI’m fully aware how this sounds. Another founder with big ideas, poetic language, and zero interest in promising hockey stick charts. Shocking. But the goal here isn’t hype. It’s control, authorship, and intention. Mecella is designed as a controlled AI media entity. Not autonomous chaos, not a content farm, and definitely not a “trust me bro” startup deck.\n\nSkepticism is healthy. I expect it. I welcome it. Just don’t confuse skepticism with laziness. If you’re going to roast it, at least roast the actual idea instead of the version you’ve already memorized from Twitter.\n\nAnyway, that’s the project. No pitch deck. No token. No countdown timer. Just an evolving system built by someone who actually writes, questions, and isn’t allergic to criticism.\n\nProceed accordingly.",

First and foremost english isnt my main language so please excuse any mistake.\nIm not familiar with programming at all, nor its terms.\n\nI used chat gpt so far, but is it appropriate for my project?...or is any (free) ai able to?\nI dont want to get all into it for it to be impossible or even jusg unachievable. I have no idea of the scale its considered to be from a programming pov.\n\nAnyways, is the project im explaining below even possible to be done fully with an AI or it is too complicated?\nI really fear it is because i keep reading stuff about how AI is good for very small things, but how small? Is my project small? Too ambitious for an AI to fully code it?\n\nBe ready, its going to be long.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nI want to build a \"small\" bot for my personnal use;\nBasically, theres a site i get items from which has a click and collect feature. However, there is no way to get notified when one of the shop has an item available.\nWhen the item is available somewhere, a click and collect button appears on the page (and leads to another page with the location of the item)\nI want the bot to notify me through email whenever an item im searching for pops up in click and collect.\nThere's a lot of urls. I estimates 500 even if its a really long shot. (Lots of small individual stuff)\n\nFor more precisions, i want the bot to check the pages every hour bewteen 8am and 8pm and just once at 2am.\nAs to not get flagged, i wanted a random delay of 5 to 8 seconds between each search.\nIf a search fail for a specific url, the bot tries again 5sec later,, then 10sec later and on the 3rd fail just abandon that URL until the next check up.\n\n[Something suggested by ChatGPT to help not get id banned]\nA cooldown ladder if the site tries to block the bot\n1st block → 45 min\n2nd → 90 min\n3rd → 135 min\n4+ → 180 min (cap)\nWith alert email if:\n≥2 block signals detected\nRisk level = 🟡 or 🔴\nMax 1 alert/hour\n\nWhen an item is available in click n collect, i want the bot to send me an email with the url to the item.\nHowever, if it does check ups every hour, i dont want to get spammed with the same email every hour.\nAn item can be at different locations at a time, but you can only see it when clicking the click n collect button.\n\nI have two options there;\n1) The one i prefer but more complicated- could the ai code it properly?\nIdentify which location the item is available at. \nSend a single email (item ### available at ###) without repeat.\nIf the same item is available at another location, i want to receive a new email about it.\n\n2) the easiest;\nHave everyday at the same hour a recap of all the listings with still available click n collect links which I got a notification email about already, to check up manually if they're maybe available at other locations.\n\nSometimes, there is false positives too; the button is available but when you click on it, it says the item isnt available for click n collect.\nI want the bot to detect it so it doesnt send me email about a false positive\n\nAfter some (confusing) searches, it seems Github Action (through a public repository) would allow me to run this stuff for free without any issue. Please do correct me if im mistaken.\n\nId love some help because im very lost. Can chat gpt (or any other free ai) code this with ease or is there too much complexity there?\n\nAgain, im very much a noob. I just want to have this tool to make things easier without refreshing like a hundred pages at any given time but i dont know how difficult my request might be for an AI, so im sorry if this request is ridiculous.\n\nAny help, insight, etc is very much appreciated, sincerely :)",

Not because it was smarter, but because the flow never broke and affordable. I tried explaining that feeling to people around me and it mostly went over their heads.Then I shared it here  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nov9ab/need\\_people\\_to\\_get\\_excited/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1nov9ab/need_people_to_get_excited/)\n\nSince then I’ve tried Cline, Claude Code, OpenCode. All of them are good tools and genuinely useful, but that original feeling didn’t really come back. It felt like improvement, not a shift.\n\nYesterday I tried Cerebras running GLM-4.7 and it was awesome. Around 1000 t/s output. Not just fast output the entire thinking phase completes almost instantly. In OpenCode, the model reasoned and responded in under a second, and my brain didn't even get the chance to lose focus.\n\nThat’s when it clicked for me: latency was the invisible friction all along. We’ve been trained to tolerate it, so we stopped noticing it. When it disappears, the experience changes completely. It feels less like waiting for an assistant and more like staying inside your own train of thought.\n\nI just wanted to share it with you guys because this good news only you can understand\n\nnote: We can't use Cerebras like a daily driver yet, their coding plans exclusive and brutal rate limits, they are able to achieve this bathroom tile size cpus, very interesting stuff I hope they succeed and do well\n\ntldr; discovered cerebras",

        "content": "Most people probably use coding agents wrong. There I said it again.\n\nThey treat agents like smart, autonomous teammates/junior dev with their own volition and intuition and then wonder why the output is chaotic, inconsistent, or subtly/less subtly broken.\n\nAn agent is not a “better ChatGPT.” The correct mental model when using agent to write your code is to be **an orchestrator of its execution**, not let it be independent thinker and expecting \"here is a task based on custom domain and my own codebase, make it work\". You have to define the structure, constraints, rules, and expectations. The agent just runs inside that box.\n\nChatGPT, Gemini, etc. work *alone* because they come with heavy built-in guardrails and guidelines and are tuned for conversation and problem solving. Agents, on the other hand, touch *all* content they have zero idea about: your code, files, tools, side effects. They don’t magically inherit discipline or domain knowledge. They have to get that knowledge.\n\nIf you don’t supply your own guardrails, standards, and explicit instructions, the agent will happily optimize for speed and hallucinate its way through your repo.\n\nAgents amplify intent. If your intent isn’t well-defined, they amplify chaos.\n\nWhat really worked best for me is this structure, for example:\n\nYou have this task to extend customer login logic:  \n\\[long wall of text that is probably JIRA task written by PM before having morning coffee\\]\n\n*this is the point where most people hit enter and just wait for agent to do \"magic\", but there is more*\n\nTo complete this task, you have to do X and Y, in those location A and B etc.\n\nBefore you start on this task use the file in root directory named **guidelines.txt** to figure how to write the code.\n\nAnd this is where the magic happens, in guidelines.txt you want:\n\n* all your ins and outs of your domain, your workflow (simplified)\n* where the meat of the app is located (models, views, infrastructure)\n* the less obvious \"gotchas\"\n* what the agent can touch\n* what the agent must NEVER touch or only after manual approval\n\nThis approach yielded best results for me and least \"man, that is just wrong, what the hell\"",

        "title": "Accelerating Discovery: How the Materials Project Is Helping to Usher in the AI Revolution for Materials Science",
        "content": "\"In 2011, a small team at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) launched what would become the world’s most-cited materials database. Today, the Materials Project serves over 650,000 users and has been cited more than 32,000 times — but its real impact may just be emerging.\n\nWhen renowned computational materials scientist Kristin Persson and her team first created the Materials Project, they envisioned an automated screening tool that could help researchers in industry and academia design new materials for batteries and other energy technologies at an accelerated pace. \\[...\\]\n\n“Machine learning is game-changing for materials discovery because it saves scientists from repeating the same process over and over while testing new chemicals and making new materials in the lab,” said Persson, the Materials Project Director and Co-Founder. “To be successful, machine learning programs need access to large amounts of high-quality, well-curated data. With its massive repository of curated data, the Materials Project is AI ready.” \\[...\\]\n\nResearchers are currently looking for new battery materials to more effectively store energy for the grid or for transportation, or new catalysts to help improve efficiencies in the chemical industry. But experimental data are available for fewer than one percent of compounds in open scientific literature, limiting our understanding of new materials and their properties. This is where data-driven materials science can help.\n\n“Accelerating materials discoveries is the key to unlocking new energy technologies,” Jain said. “What the Materials Project has enabled over the last decade is for researchers to get a sense of the properties of hundreds of thousands of materials by using high-fidelity computational simulations. That in turn has allowed them to design materials much more quickly as well as to develop machine-learning models that predict materials behavior for whatever application they’re interested in.” \\[...\\]\n\nThe Microsoft Corp. has also used the Materials Project to train models for materials science, most recently to develop a tool called MatterGen, a generative model for inorganic materials design. Microsoft Azure Quantum developed a new battery electrolyte using data from the Materials Project.\n\nOther notable studies used the Materials Project to successfully design functional materials for promising new applications. In 2020, researchers from UC Santa Barbara, Argonne National Laboratory, and Berkeley Lab synthesized Mn1+xSb, a magnetic compound with promise for thermal cooling in electronics, automotive, aerospace, and energy applications. The researchers found the magnetocaloric material through a Materials Project screening of over 5,000 candidate compounds.\n\nIn addition to accessing the vast database, the materials community can also contribute new data to the Materials Project through a platform called MPContribs. This allows national lab facilities, academic institutions, companies, and others who have generated large data sets on materials to share that data with the broader research community.\n\nOther community contributions have expanded coverage into previously unexplored areas through new material predictions and experimental validations. For example, Google Deepmind — Google’s artificial intelligence lab — used the Materials Project to train initial GNoME (graph networks for materials exploration) models to predict the total energy of a crystal, a key metric of a material’s stability. Through that work, which was published in the journal Nature in 2023, Google DeepMind contributed nearly 400,000 new compounds to the Materials Project, broadening the platform’s vast toolkit of material properties and simulations.\"",

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, we have all used AI coding assistants by now. Things like Cursor, Windsurf, Kline, and even Kilo Code itself. They're all great, but there's one issue. You have to open up your IDE to use them. You have to switch context from whatever you're doing to your code editor. But what if you could just message your AI coding assistant like you message a co-worker? What if you could just say, \"Hey, fix that bug we were discussing,\" right in Slack and it would just do it? Well, that's exactly what Kilo Slack integration does. It's basically like having an AI developer as a teammate in your Slack workspace. You can DM it, mention it in threads, and it can push PRs, fix bugs, and answer questions about your codebase. It's pretty cool. So, let's talk about it and see how it works. Now, the whole idea here is that Kilo acts like a co-worker. Think about it. When you're chatting with your team in Slack and someone mentions a bug, what do you usually do? You either assign it to someone, or you go fix it yourself. But with Kilo, you can just tag @Kilo in that thread and say, \"Hey, can you fix this?\" And it will actually go and fix it. It understands the context of the conversation and makes the changes. This is quite different from the usual workflow where you have to copy the issue, open your IDE, find the file, make the changes, and then push. Here, you just ask Kilo like you'd ask a teammate, which is pretty amazing, to be honest. So, to set it up, you'd have to go to Kilo Code site, and then log in, and then set up your GitHub repo over here. So, do that, and you should be good to go. But we also need to configure Slack. So, to do that, you can just go to integrations, and here, you'll find the Slack option. Hit it, and follow the onscreen instructions and just get it set up. Now, you'd have to also set up the model that you want it to use when it responds to you in Slack. By default, it's MiniMax M2.1, which is free for Slack by Kilo Code for now, which is really very awesome. And I'd recommend you to use that, but I want the full glory. So, I'm going to use Opus here. Now, let's look at the main features. The first one is direct messaging. You can just DM Kilo and ask it to make changes to your codebase. You don't need to open your IDE at all. Just describe what you want, and it will analyze your repositories and implement the changes. It's like slacking your co-worker and saying, \"Hey, can you add this feature?\" Except this co-worker never sleeps and doesn't complain about context switching. The second feature is thread-based bug fixes. This is where the co-worker thing really shines. Let's say your team is discussing a bug in a Slack thread. Instead of someone having to go and fix it later, you can just mention @Kilo in that thread. It reads the entire conversation, understands what the bug is, looks at your code, and proposes a fix. It's basically participating in your team discussions like an actual team member. The third thing is knowledge base access. You know how sometimes you need to ask someone, \"Hey, what's our deployment process again?\" Or, \"Where's the documentation for this API?\" Well, Kilo can answer all of that. It has access to your company docs, coding standards, and all that stuff. So, instead of searching through Notion or Confluence, you can just ask Kilo directly in Slack. And the fourth major feature is pull request generation. This is really cool. Let's say your team has a discussion about adding a new feature. Everyone agrees on what needs to be done. Instead of someone taking notes and then implementing it later, you can just ask Kilo to create a PR based on the conversation. It captures the context, implements the agreed-upon changes, and opens a pull request automatically. So, your Slack discussions can directly turn into code changes, which is just amazing. Now, let me talk about why I think this co-worker approach is really interesting. Most AI coding tools treat AI as a tool. You open the tool, you use it, you close it. But this approach treats AI as a teammate. It's always there in your Slack, just like your other teammates. You can casually mention it when you need help, just like you'd mention a colleague. It is quite similar to Devin, but it doesn't cost you like a bazillion dollars. And you can't control anything in it like the models and stuff. With this, you're fully in control and can configure the models and stuff. This also means you don't lose context. When you're discussing something in Slack and need a code change, you don't have to switch to another app, explain the context again, and then come back. The AI is already in the conversation. It knows what you're talking about. For teams, this is quite powerful. Everyone can see what Kilo is doing. The discussions, the bug fixes, the feature implementations, they're all visible in Slack. It's transparent, which is good for team collaboration. Now, there are some things to keep in mind. First, you need to have your GitHub repos connected for this to work properly. Without that, Kilo won't be able to make actual code changes. Second, like any AI tool, it's not perfect. There might be times when it doesn't understand the context correctly or makes mistakes. So, you should always review the PRs it creates before merging them. Treat it like you would treat a junior developer's code. Review and verify. Third, this is great for routine tasks and quick fixes. For complex architectural changes, you might still want to use the full IDE experience with Kilo's planning mode and things like that. I mean, you can just start using it right now with the same Kilo credits that you might already be using in the extension. Plus, if you use MiniMax M2.1, then it's basically free right now. So, you can check it out for free right now, which is awesome. I think this is a pretty cool approach. The idea of having an AI that behaves like a co-worker rather than a separate tool is quite interesting. It reduces context switching, keeps everything transparent in Slack, and makes AI assistance feel more natural. If you're already using Kilo for your coding tasks and you work in a team that uses Slack, this is definitely worth checking out. Having your AI assistant right there in your team chat is really convenient. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
