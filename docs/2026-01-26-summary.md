### Research Breakthroughs & Significant Findings
*   **CUDA Backend Ported to ROCm using Claude Code:** A Redditor successfully ported an entire NVIDIA CUDA backend to AMD's ROCm using Claude Code in just 30 minutes, indicating a potential breakthrough in reducing AI's reliance on NVIDIA's proprietary hardware ecosystem.

*   **Social Media as AI Data Bioreactors:** Meta formally announced the use of public Facebook and Instagram content for AI training, highlighting how social platforms function as "data bioreactors" where user interactions feed machine learning models. Research also showed AI bots actively probing social organisms, demonstrating manipulation capabilities (e.g., r/changemymind experiment).

*   **Rapid Programming Language Development with AI:** Experienced developers are leveraging AI tools (like Claude Code) to build entire programming languages and large codebases in exceptionally short periods (e.g., 24 hours for Elo, two weeks for 70,000 lines of code). This suggests AI is dramatically compressing the "typing" aspect of development, though AI-generated code may have more issues.
