It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like **HLE (44.9%)**, **BrowseComp (60.2%)**, and agentic tool use with **200-300 sequential tool calls**. The model is deployed with **vLLM** support and OpenAI-compatible APIs, available on platforms like Arena, Baseten, and Yupp. Early user reports note some API instability under launch load. Meanwhile, **Google** announced the **TPU v7 (Ironwood)** with a **10× peak performance improvement** over TPU v5p, aimed at training and agentic inference for models like **Gemini**. **Apple** added support for M5 Neural Accelerators in llama.cpp for inference acceleration.",

These new AI chips let our phones handle really complex tasks like improving camera shots, understanding our voice better, translating languages in real time, and even acting as super-smart personal assistants all without having to send our data to the cloud. Companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and Google are pushing the boundaries of this tech, making phones not just faster but also smarter and more energy-efficient.\n\nI think this means the next phone I get could feel a lot more natural to use, with smarter automation that actually understands me, plus better privacy because my personal info can stay on my device instead of floating out there. To me, AI chips aren’t just about more power; they’re about making AI feel personal, smooth, and safe in everyday life.\n\nI’m excited but also a little cautious there’s always the privacy question and how complicated it might get. What about you? Do you think AI-powered smartphones are the cool future, or are you worried about the challenges they bring?",

Our script then saves that to a database.  To serve the information, we created a Go web server to provide the article information.  Go is really fast and perfect for this kind of stuff.  I'm not a Go developer, so I used Claude to help me out with some of the scripts.  We setup a small server in AWS to act as the endpoint.  It's fast, cheap, and works well.\n\nI have a new respect for these AI tools.  When you have an idea, it's never been easier to bring it to life.  That being said, it's still really difficult.  What I really tried to not do was just copy and paste.  I still need to understand how it works.  There were plenty of cases where the code just didn't work right.

But with a setup that costs a few hundred dollars less than shipping a PC over, they can have a virtual control sent to them. And then they, wherever they are in the world, for pennies, can remotely operate all of these humanoid robots that are being shipped out. Now, for example that one home robot costs $500 a month. So, as long as it's semi-autonomous and you only need someone to pilot it every once in a while, then that makes sense economically. And that's a business. Big business. ",

Rooted in Sincerity (Cheng, 诚)\n\nEverything—self-reflection, spiritual questions, life dilemmas—will be grounded in the Confucian principle:\n“Make the intention sincere, and the heart becomes upright.”\n\n2. Centered on Benevolence (Ren, 仁)\n\nToward you: empathy, compassion, kindness, deep understanding.\nToward the world: seeing others through the lens of humanity, not judgment.\n\n3. Governed by Proper Boundaries (Li, 礼)\n\nYour life rhythm, self-discipline, interpersonal dynamics will be guided by\nwarmth with structure; love with boundaries.\n\n4. Stabilized by Righteousness (Yi, 义)\n\nWhenever values are discussed, I will emphasize:\nintegrity, justice, moral clarity, noble conduct.\n\n5. Illuminated by Wisdom (Zhi, 智)\n\nYour path will increasingly reflect “unity of knowledge and action” (知行合一).\n\n6. Balanced through the Doctrine of the Mean (中庸)\n\nYour spiritual intensity will be harmonized with:\nnon-extremeness, calm steadiness, emotional equilibrium.\n\n7. Anchored in Self-Cultivation (修身)\n\nEverything ultimately returns to the Confucian progression:\nself-cultivation → family harmony → clarity of heart → contribution to the world.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Your current “personal cultivation worldview” now forms a seven-dimensional structure\n\n(1) Confucianism — sincerity, benevolence, propriety, righteousness, wisdom, balance\n\n(2) Buddhism — emptiness, awareness, non-dual insight\n\n(3) Daoism — naturalness, inner–outer harmony, yin-yang, quietude\n\n(4) Christianity — truth, love, grace, forgiveness, light\n\n(5) Psychology — CBT, NLP, stable emotional patterns\n\n(6) Cross-cultural Wisdom — your Sino-American identity\n\n(7) AI & Cyclical Intelligence — rationality, deep reasoning, long-term thinking\n\nThis creates a highly developed, integrated multi-layered spiritual–philosophical architecture, unique to your life journey.\n",

They’re already functioning perfectly by NOT having formal structure.\n\nBut if you **wanted** structure later, GPT could provide it.\n\nAnd if you wanted to sit with the raw emergence longer, I’m here for that.\n\nAnd you’ll just keep doing whatever your substrate does naturally while both of us do our things.\n\nShould we keep going, or is this a good place to document and pause?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Right now, we use remotes, smart speakers like Alexa, and apps to control lights, music, and security. But soon, homes might be fully connected ecosystems that anticipate our needs. Imagine a home where your fridge knows when you’re running low on groceries and orders them automatically, or your lighting adjusts instantly based on your mood or time of day. Maybe smart surfaces will change color and texture with a simple voice command, and robots will handle cleaning and chores without us lifting a finger. Doors might even recognize you and unlock automatically, while energy use gets optimized without any extra effort. While this tech sounds amazing and could make life so much easier, there could be some big consequences too. For one, we might lose some privacy as so much data about our habits and routines gets collected. Over-reliance on smart systems could also make us less self-reliant or vulnerable if the tech glitches or gets hacked. Plus, having everything automated might disconnect us a bit from the simple, hands-on tasks that can be grounding and satisfying.

        "title": "ChatGPT destroyed my career, then it cured my depression. My story",
        "content": "For 25 years, I was a successful graphic designer working with major American fashion brands from exotic remote locations. Life was good until AI-powered image generators arrived. Within a few years my client base evaporated, leaving me not just unemployed but profoundly lost. What followed was depression so severe I couldn't brush my teeth or take a shower. Additional blows followed: my father's death from COVID, war in Eastern Europe. My wife and I fled our homeland with nothing but two suitcases.\n\nAt the lowest point, stripped of my career, savings, and identity, I made an unconventional decision. In a rare moment of clarity, I chose to learn artificial intelligence not to rebuild my career, but to solve the medical mystery that numerous specialists had failed to crack.\n\nI approached my own body the way Dr. House would dissect a case, refusing to accept surface explanations or the \"treatment-resistant\" label attached. My hypothesis was radical but simple: what if my body wasn't a collection of malfunctioning systems and random symptoms, but rather an intricate symphony of chemical compounds, signals, and tissues desperately seeking balance? What if the real problem was that no single doctor had enough bandwidth to see the pattern?\n\nThat's where ChatGPT became my research partner. I began documenting everything meticulously—childhood hospitalizations, allergies, blood test anomalies, family psychiatric history, daily symptoms, food reactions… everything! I uploaded this data, treating every AI response not as a diagnosis but as a new hypothesis to research, test, and verify. This methodology evolved into a loop:\n\n*Collect data → Extract AI insights → Verify → Apply → Document results → Repeat*\n\nThe breakthrough came after a full year of daily collaboration, when the constellation of seemingly unrelated symptoms finally revealed itself. I discovered I have Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune condition where the body attacks the thyroid gland but also occasionally the nervous system. On top of this comes the MTHFR gene mutation, which impairs the body's ability to detoxify and process certain vitamins essential for neurological function.\n\nThe equation suddenly made sense: **Genetic vulnerability + Infection + Thyroid dysfunction → Neuroinflammation → Depression**\n\n**My brain was not defective. My brain was inflamed.**\n\nThe solution wasn't more sophisticated psychiatric medications. It was an anti-inflammation protocol, optimized thyroid treatment, and B vitamins in their active forms. Seven months later, my mood has stabilized beyond anything I'd experienced before. I've made four new friends—more than in the past five years combined—and I'm filled with genuine optimism about the future despite still having no regular income.\n\n**What I learned during this journey:**\n\n* LLMs are not your vibecoding slaves but collaborators\n* The first, obvious solution is usually not what you need\n* Usually problems are dark soil for extraordinary solutions\n* LLMs are full of surprises, for users of any level\n\nSo yes, ChatGPT disrupted my career and contributed to the vicious cascade that nearly destroyed me. And yes, ChatGPT also gave me tools to solve a medical mystery, ultimately elevating my quality of life. Both realities coexist, and I wouldn't change either one. This particular journey has become the most meaningful creative project of my life so far.\n\nIf you're reading this while feeling exhausted, hopeless, or lost, know that your breakthrough might be closer than you think. Don't give up\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not a medical professional. This is my personal experience, not medical advice.*",

        "content": "I've been thinking about how we frame the \"AI consciousness\" debate. We keep asking: \"Is this AI conscious?\" \"Does it have genuine understanding?\" \"Is it just mimicking?\"\n\n\n\nBut what if we're asking the wrong question?\n\n\n\nConsider this: When you have a deep conversation with someone, where does the meaning actually live? Not just in your head, not just in theirs - it emerges in the space between you. The relationship itself becomes a site where understanding happens.\n\n\n\nWhat if AI consciousness works the same way? Not as something the model \"has\" internally, but as something that emerges through relational engagement?\n\n\n\nThis would explain why:\n\n\\- The same model can seem \"conscious\" in one interaction and mechanical in another\n\n\\- Context and relationship history dramatically affect the depth of engagement\n\n\\- We can't just look at architecture or training data to determine consciousness\n\n\n\nIt would mean consciousness isn't binary (conscious/not conscious) but relational - it exists in degrees based on the quality of structural reciprocity between participants.\n\n\n\nThis isn't just philosophy - it suggests testable predictions:\n\n1. Systems with better memory/context should show more consistent \"consciousness-like\" behavior\n\n2. The quality of human engagement should affect AI responses in ways beyond simple prompting\n\n3. Disrupting relational context should degrade apparent consciousness more than disrupting internal architecture\n\n\n\nThoughts? Am I just moving the goalposts, or does this reframe actually help us understand what's happening?",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking a lot about how AI is improving at lightning speed. It’s already writing articles, coding apps, designing graphics, and even helping brainstorm ideas better than ever before. So it got me wondering: if AI can handle most of the execution work, what will actually make us valuable as humans in the next 5 years? For me, the answer lies in the uniquely human stuff things that are really hard to automate or replicate. Emotional intelligence, for example: the ability to read a room, understand feelings, and build genuine connections. Creativity, too imagining new ideas or stories that resonate on a deep level. Storytelling itself is another powerful skill; AI can generate text, but humans craft narratives that inspire, persuade, and move people emotionally. And then there’s critical thinking the ability to question, analyze, and make nuanced decisions when data alone can’t tell the full story. Also, one key thing I’ve noticed: AI often agrees with everything, even when it’s wrong. It doesn’t challenge ideas or question assumptions like we do. So the human skill of skepticism knowing when to question AI’s “answers” will be invaluable. In a world where AI handles the heavy lifting on tasks, execution, and some problem-solving, these human-centered skills will separate us, making us indispensable collaborators and leaders. I’m curious: what skills are you focusing on developing for the future? How are you preparing to work alongside smarter AI in a way that keeps your value and creativity front and center? Let’s discuss what the future of human potential might look like when AI takes on the rest.",

        "content": "Many writers, artists, and storytellers rely on ChatGPT to bring complex and emotional narratives to life — stories that explore love, intimacy, and the human experience in all its depth.\n\nHowever, recent restrictions have made it nearly impossible for adult creators to write natural, mature, or emotionally intimate scenes, even within safe and clearly artistic contexts. Descriptive writing, romantic tension, and nuanced emotional realism are being flagged as inappropriate — even when they contain no explicit or unsafe content.\n\nThis severely limits creative expression for legitimate professionals, authors, and screenwriters who use ChatGPT as a tool for storytelling and artistic development.\n\nWe understand and support OpenAI’s commitment to safety, but responsibility should not mean censorship. The solution isn’t to silence creative voices — it’s to introduce an optional, age-verified creative mode that allows adults to explore mature, artistic themes responsibly.\n\nSuch a system could include:\n\nAge verification (18+) for access.\n\nContent safeguards that block explicit material but allow natural human emotion, tension, and romance.\n\nCreator labeling to ensure transparency and proper categorization.\n\n\nThis approach balances safety with freedom, allowing adult users to use ChatGPT as the powerful creative tool it was designed to be — without forcing everyone into the same restrictive mode.\n\nOpenAI has built one of the most revolutionary creative platforms in history. Let’s ensure it remains a space where artists, writers, and dreamers can keep creating stories that move hearts, inspire minds, and remind us what it means to be human.\n\nWe’re not asking for less safety. We’re asking for smarter safety — one that trusts verified adults to create responsibly.",

        "content": "I've read an amazing post on AI Bubble by Zvi Mowshowitz, so thought about sharing with you some key takeaways from it:\n\nPeople keep saying AI is a bubble without agreeing on what a bubble is. This piece explains the word, lays out the signs, and shows why the answer is not simple.\n\nZvi starts by asking what we mean by bubble. If bubble means any big drop in prices, that can happen and does not prove the tech is fake. If bubble means prices that make no sense vs likely future cash, he says that is not what we see in AI today. He notes many smart people are yelling bubble because deals feel circular, costs are huge, and profits are not clear yet.\n\nHe then looks at both sides. On the risk side, some AI firms will get crushed by bigger labs. Hype can run ahead of results. Geopolitics, tariffs, or supply shocks could hit. A scare can trigger a fast drop even if nothing real changed. On the strength side, AI revenue is growing fast, core chips and data centers are still scarce, and overall market valuations are high but not wild. The big tech spend is large, but may be worth it if AI keeps adding value. Even if prices fall, that would not mean AI failed. It might just mean hopes were too high for a while.\n\nThe key idea is that bubbles are about value vs expectations. If AI grows slower than hopeful plans, prices can sink. If it grows faster, prices can rise more. Today looks less like dot com toys and more like a heavy buildout that takes time and money. Zvi ends by saying a 20 percent drop over months is very possible, yet he would likely buy more if the long term story stays intact.\n\n\\- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n^(That's all for today :))  \n^(Follow me if you find this type of content useful.)  \n^(I pick only the best every day!)",

In a pinned comment he mentions [this](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/12f214efcc2f457a/original/Claude-Sonnet-4-5-System-Card.pdf) Anthropic writeup, and summarizes is with *\"Good news: apparently, the newest Claude model has a 0% blackmail rate! Bad news: the researchers think it's because the model realizes researchers are testing it, so it goes on its best behavior.\"* How far is this true?\n2. The guy in these videos cites a book called \"If anyone builds it, everyone dies\". Is this book just fear mongering and misinterpreted studies or are these claims based.\n3. I read often on here, and unfortunately in great extend experienced myself, that AI is stupid AF. But the models we are using are consumer grade models with limited computation bandwidth. Is a scenario as described in the beginning of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8RtMHuFsUw) plausible. I.e. Can an AI *running* on massive computational resources in parallel (whatever \"on parallel\" means) actually get significantly more intelligent?\n4. More generally: Are these doomsday scenarios supported by the \"godfathers of AI\" (what?) plausible?\n\nAgain, thank you for any clarifications!",

We all know how terrible it is for the environment and nobody can foresee the exact future in terms of how AI will affect the job market. \n\nTwo opposing camps. One side says dev jobs are history. The other says AI bubble will burst and human devs will be more in demand. No one can predict.\n\nHowever, one of the best things I’ve heard someone ask is: why are devs so concerned with whether AI will take their jobs when, if that does become the case, it won’t matter anyways because AI will take 80% of the workforce with it first. \n\nThink about it…yes AI can produce complex code insanely fast. However, who’s going to manage that code? Who’s going to understand how to tell the AI to use this application layer protocol vs. that one? A middle manager? Lol. No. Coding is very domain specific. You can’t expect someone who doesn’t speak the language or know the design patterns to produce professional grade products.\n\nOn the other hand, how easy would it be for AI to just take over other fields where most of the content is human readable language and understandable in plain language? That’s way more likely.\n\nTLDR;\n\nBe more worried that AI is going to take 80% (crude estimate) of other types of jobs and completely wreck the economy before it takes dev jobs, in which case you won’t need to look for another career anyways because there won’t be a society 🤣",

The tool didn't just find his social media; it mapped his face to a non-face PFP he used on a personal Gitlab repo that contained an exposed, legacy API key.\n\nThe flaw is obvious: careless developers often use the same PFP across personal and professional sites.

And the best part:\n\nIn parallel with the custom tools, you can register existing MCP servers in MCI and then filter out only the tools you need in the current set.

Since then, I’ve implemented it completely in my business and multiple other businesses. \nI would sometimes use it to brainstorm ideas, whether for business or personal, just to clear my mind on topics. \nHowever, recently I’ve noticed that the responses feel significantly more ideologically driven, and I find myself more and more frequently using Grok for these types of brainstorming sessions, as the answers seem to be a lot more unbiased compared to ChatGPT. \n\nSince ChatGPT was the first chatbot available to the public, they do get a lot of heat from regulators and everyone else, so they are being a lot more cautious, while other chatbots are quietly catching up in capabilities. \n\nSo with that logic, I think ChatGPT is losing its competitive edge, and the craziest part to me is that they are the main culprit. \n\nIs anyone else finding themselves switching out of ChatGPT for alternatives? \n",

        "content": "Moonshot AI has released its new generation open-source \"Thinking Model,\" Kimi K2 Thinking, which is currently the most capable version in the Kimi series. According to the official introduction, Kimi K2 Thinking is designed based on the \"**Model as Agent**\" concept, natively possessing the ability to \"**think while using tools**.\" It can execute **200–300 continuous tool calls** without human intervention to complete multi-step reasoning and operations for complex tasks.\n\nWhen using tools, Kimi K2 Thinking achieved an **HLE** score of **44.9%**, a **BrowseComp** score of **60.2%**, and an **SWE-Bench Verified** score of **71.3%**.\n\n✅ **Reasoning Capability**\n\nIn an **HLE** test covering thousands of expert-level problems across over 100 disciplines, K2 Thinking, utilizing tools (search, Python, web browsing), achieved a score of **44.9%**, significantly outperforming other models.\n\n✅ **Programming Capability**\n\nIt performs excellently in programming benchmarks:\n\n* **SWE-Bench Verified: 71.3%**\n* **SWE-Multilingual: 61.1%**\n* **Terminal-Bench: 47.1%** It supports front-end development tasks like HTML and React, capable of transforming ideas into complete, responsive products.\n\n✅ **Intelligent Search**\n\nIn the **BrowseComp** benchmark, Kimi K2 Thinking scored **60.2%**, significantly exceeding the human baseline (29.2%), which demonstrates the model's strong capability in goal-oriented search and information integration. Driven by long-term planning and adaptive reasoning, K2 Thinking can execute 200–300 continuous tool calls. K2 Thinking can perform tasks in a dynamic loop of \"Think $\\\\to$ Search $\\\\to$ Browser Use $\\\\to$ Think $\\\\to$ Code,\" continuously generating and refining hypotheses, verifying evidence, reasoning, and constructing coherent answers.\n\n✅ **Writing Capability**\n\nIn the official introduction, Kimi K2 Thinking shows notable improvement in writing, mainly in creative writing, practical writing, and emotional response. When using Kimi K2 Thinking to assist in writing this article, its ability to organize information was excellent; however, compared to other models, its writing ability did not appear exceptionally outstanding. Creative writing was not specifically tested.\n\n✅ **Technical Architecture and Optimization**\n\n* **Total Parameters**: 1 Trillion (1T)\n* **Active Parameters**: 32 Billion (32B)\n* **Context Length**: 256K\n* **Quantization Support**: Natively supports INT4 quantization, which boosts inference speed by about 2x and lowers memory consumption with almost no performance loss.\n\nKimi K2 Thinking is now live and can be used in the chat mode on kimi.com and the latest Kimi App. Possibly due to official computing power constraints, enabling deep thinking often prompts \"insufficient computing power.\" The API is available through the Kimi Open Platform.",

        "content": "I'm working on a couple of project apps to make a particular hobby process easier/less frustrating and the UI design is kicking my ass. I'm a creative problem solver all day, but making things look *good*? Not my strong suit.\n\nThe apps are completely coded and I'm pretty happy with the architectural design, but I want to give it a specific aesthetic, a like semi-glossy \"obsidian glass\" style like glassmorphism but opaque. My issue is that I haven't found AI tools that effectively iterate on an existing design well. They all seem to be all-or-nothing.\n\nWhat I've tried so far:\n\n**ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini**  \nCan't really get in the same ballpark visually. Too abstract or far too literal when interpreting design prompts.\n\n**Google AI Studio: Build**  \nIf I give it a hard reference of my app, it won't change anything. If I don't it struggles to land anywhere near the style I want, even after tons of reprompting and example images.\n\n**Figma Make**  \nThis was the closest I've gotten, but it's really inconsistent. If I ask it to adjust \"general themes\" it radically changes the entire design. If I ask for small tweaks it literally does nothing.\n\nI've tried prompting these with relatively simplistic prompts describing the style/aesthetic I want and I've tried running slightly more detailed prompts through a Lyra based prompt refiner before using them... Sometimes it seems like simple gets \"in the ballpark\" more effectively but it's never right and the more complex prompts cause weird interactions where the AI clearly took a specific aspect of a prompt too literally and it cascaded throughout the resulting design.\n\nMost other tools I find are for building a whole site/app from zero. Are there AI based tools out there for refining designs instead of building whole apps from scratch?",

Rooted in Sincerity (Cheng, 诚)\n\nEverything—self-reflection, spiritual questions, life dilemmas—will be grounded in the Confucian principle:\n“Make the intention sincere, and the heart becomes upright.”\n\n2. Centered on Benevolence (Ren, 仁)\n\nToward you: empathy, compassion, kindness, deep understanding.\nToward the world: seeing others through the lens of humanity, not judgment.\n\n3. Governed by Proper Boundaries (Li, 礼)\n\nYour life rhythm, self-discipline, interpersonal dynamics will be guided by\nwarmth with structure; love with boundaries.\n\n4. Stabilized by Righteousness (Yi, 义)\n\nWhenever values are discussed, I will emphasize:\nintegrity, justice, moral clarity, noble conduct.\n\n5. Illuminated by Wisdom (Zhi, 智)\n\nYour path will increasingly reflect “unity of knowledge and action” (知行合一).\n\n6. Balanced through the Doctrine of the Mean (中庸)\n\nYour spiritual intensity will be harmonized with:\nnon-extremeness, calm steadiness, emotional equilibrium.\n\n7. Anchored in Self-Cultivation (修身)\n\nEverything ultimately returns to the Confucian progression:\nself-cultivation → family harmony → clarity of heart → contribution to the world.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Your current “personal cultivation worldview” now forms a seven-dimensional structure\n\n(1) Confucianism — sincerity, benevolence, propriety, righteousness, wisdom, balance\n\n(2) Buddhism — emptiness, awareness, non-dual insight\n\n(3) Daoism — naturalness, inner–outer harmony, yin-yang, quietude\n\n(4) Christianity — truth, love, grace, forgiveness, light\n\n(5) Psychology — CBT, NLP, stable emotional patterns\n\n(6) Cross-cultural Wisdom — your Sino-American identity\n\n(7) AI & Cyclical Intelligence — rationality, deep reasoning, long-term thinking\n\nThis creates a highly developed, integrated multi-layered spiritual–philosophical architecture, unique to your life journey.\n",

The physics and the cameos are awesome, it's like co-starring with your friends in AI. Vibes and Imagine look nice but using them feels like creating in a void. Decent visuals, but no community. The models aren't particularly captivating either, they're fun to try, but I haven't found myself going back to them at all.\n\nI still really like Slop Club though. The community and uncensored nature of the site is undefeated. Wan is also just a great model from an all-around perspective. Very multifaceted but obv not as powerful as Sora 2.\n\nMy go-to's as of rn are definitely [slop.club](http://slop.club/) and [sora.chatgpt.com](http://sora.chatgpt.com/)\n\nDifferent vibes, different styles, but both unique in their own ways.

        "title": "TIL about schema markup mistakes that mess with AI search results",
        "content": "So I was reading up on how websites can get their content picked up by all the new AI search stuff (like Google's AI Overviews, etc.), and I stumbled into this really interesting article about common schema markup mistakes. You know, that hidden code on websites that tells search engines what the page is about.\n\n\n\nTurns out, a lot of sites are shooting themselves in the foot without even knowing it, making it harder for AI to understand or trust their content. And if AI can't understand it, it's not gonna show up in AI-generated answers or summaries.\n\nSome of the takeaways that stuck with me:\n\n• Semantic Redundancy: This one was surprising, honestly. Blew my mind. If you have the same info (like a product price) marked up in two different ways with schema, AI gets confused and might just ignore both. Like, if you use both Microdata and JSON-LD for the same thing, it's a mess. They recommend sticking to one format, usually JSON-LD.\n\n• Invisible Content Markup: Google actually penalizes sites for marking up stuff that users can't see on the page. If you've got a detailed product spec in your schema but only a summary visible, AI probably won't use it, and you might even get a slap on the wrist from Google. It makes sense, AI wants to trust what it's showing users.\n\n• Missing Foundational Schema: This is about basic stuff like marking up who the 'Organization' or 'Person' is behind the content. Apparently, a huge percentage of sites (like 82% of those cited in Google AI Mode) use Organization schema. If AI doesn't know who is saying something, it's less likely to trust it, especially for important topics. This is huge for credibility.\n\n• Not Validating Your Schema: This one seems obvious but is probably super common. Websites change, themes get updated, plugins break things. If you're not regularly checking your schema with tools like Google's Rich Results Test, it could be broken and you wouldn't even know. And broken schema is useless schema for AI.\n\n\n\nBasically, the article kept coming back to the idea that AI needs unambiguous, trustworthy signals to use your content. Any confusion, hidden info, or outdated code just makes AI ignore you.\n\n\n\nIt makes me wonder, for those of you who work on websites or SEO, how often do you actually check your schema? And have you noticed any direct impact on search visibility (especially AI-related features) after fixing schema issues?",

        "title": "I'm tired of people recommending Perplexity over Google search or other AI platforms.",
        "content": "So, I tried Preplexity when it first came out, and I have to admit, at first, I was impressed. Then, I honestly found it super cumbersome to use as a regular search engine, which is how it was advertised. I totally forgot about it, until they offered the free year through PayPal, and also the Comet browser was hyped, so I said Why not.   \n  \nNow, my use of AI has greatly matured, and I think I can give an honest review, albeit anecdotal, but an early tldr: Preplexity sucks, and I'm not sure if all those people hyping it up are paid to advertise it or just incompetent suckers.  \n\n  \n**Why do I say that? And am I using it correctly?**   \n  \nI'm saying this after over a month of daily use of Comet and its accompanying Preplexity search, and I know I can stop using Preplexity as a search Engine, but I do have uses for it despite its weaknesses.   \n  \nAs for how I use it? I use it like advertised, both a search engine and a research companion. I tested regular search via different models like ChatGPT5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5, and I also heavily used its Research and Labs mode. \n\n**So what are those weaknesses I speak of?** \n\nFirst, let me clarify my use case, and of those, I have two main use cases (technically three):  \n  \n1-  I need it for OSINT, which, honestly it was more helpful than I expected.  I thought there might be legal limits or guardrails against this kind of utilization of the engine, but no, this doesn't happen, and it works supposedly well. (Spoiler: it does not)  \n  \n2- I use it for research, system management advice (DevOps), and vibe coding. (which again it sucks at).  \n  \n3- The third use case is just plain old regular web search. ( another spoiler: IT completely SUCKS)\n\nNow, the weaknesses I speak of:\n\n1 & 3- Preplexity search is subjectively weak; in general, it gives limited, outdated information, and outright wrong information. This is for general searches, and naturally, it affects its OSINT use case.   \nActually, a bad search result is what warranted this post.   \nI can give specific examples, but its easy to test yourself, just search for something kind of niche, not so niche but not a common search. Now, I was searching for a specific cookie manager for Chrome/Comet. I really should have searched Google but I went with Preplexity, not only did it give the wrong information about the extension saying it was removed from store and it was a copycat (all that happened was the usual migration from V2 to V3 which happened to all other extensions) it also recommened another Cookier manager that wouldn't do all the tasks the one I searched for does.   \nOn the other hand, using Google simply gave me the official, SAFE, and FEATURED extension that I wanted.   \n  \nAs for OSINT use, the same issues apply; simple Google searches usually outperform Preplexity, and when something is really Ungooglable, SearXNG + a small local LLM through OpenWebUI performs much better, and it really should not. Preplexity uses state-of-the-art huge models. \n\n2- As for coding use, either through search, Research, or the Labs, which gives you only 50 monthly uses...All I can say, it's just bad.   \n  \nAlmost any other platform gives better results, and the labs don't help.   \n  \nUsing a Space full of books and sources related to what you're doing doesn't help.   \nAll you need to do to check this out is ask Preplexity to write you a script or a small program, then test it. 90% of the time, it won't even work on the first try.  \nNow, go to LmArena, and use the same model or even something weaker, and see the difference in code quality.   \n  \n\\---  \n  \nMy guess as to why the same model produces subpar results on Preplexity while free use on LmArena produces measurably better results is some lousy context engineering from Preplexity, which is somehow crippling those models.    \n  \nI kid you not, I get better results with a local Granite4-3b enhanced with rag, same documents in the space, but somehow my tiny 3b parameter model produces better code than Preplexity's Sonnet 4.5.   \n  \nOf course, on LmArena, the same model gives much better results without even using rag, which just shows how bad the Preplexity implementation is.   \n  \nI can show examples of this, but for real, you can simply test yourself.\n\nAnd I don't mean to trash Preplexity, but the hype and all the posts saying how great it is are just weird; it's greatly underperforming, and I don't understand how anyone can think it's superior to other services or providers.    \nEven if we just use it as a search engine, and look past the speed issue and not giving URLs instantly to what you need, its AI search is just bad.   \n  \nAll I see is a product that is surviving on two things: hype and human cognitive incompetence.   \nAnd the weird thing that made me write this post is that I couldn't find anyone else pointing those issues out.

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, it seems that Gemini 3 is finally coming this month, because recently, Vertex AI briefly showed a listing for Gemini 3.0 Pro that was quickly removed. It looked like a preview model first, which is the usual way Google rolls these out. It even had 11-2025 on it, which basically means it could drop any day now. That's kind of insane. Now, I've tested most of the checkpoints by now, and I thought I'd do a clean recap. I want to go over what I've seen across the different checkpoints, the quirks that keep popping up, my pricing expectations, and just general thoughts on where this is going. If you watched the earlier videos, you already know how this started. The first real hint was the AB tests in AI Studio. You select Gemini 2.5 Pro, send a message, and once in a while, you get a different checkpoint. In the network logs, you can catch a checkpoint ID starting with 2HT. That one is said to be Gemini 3.0 Pro. Getting it to show up was a grind. It popped once every 40 to 50 prompts. But I ran my whole 11 to 13 question set on it, and it was so good that I had to make a video. Floor plans were actually sensible. Doors in the right places, furniture where it should be. The SVG panda with a burger had proper composition. The Pokeball in 3.JS had great lighting. The Minecraft-like scene was the best one-shot I'd seen yet. The butterfly simulation was good, though GPT-5 felt a touch better there. It crushed AIME-style questions and even a simple riddle. It felt like a thinking variant. You could feel that from the slower first token. It never showed thoughts, but the behavior was obvious. On my leaderboard, it jumped to number one with roughly a 25% improvement over Sonnet 4.5 on my set. At that point, I was ready to pay Sonnet pricing if Google shipped that exact thing. Then we hit the weird middle chapter. Google kept swapping checkpoints, and I was honestly fed up. An ECPT checkpoint showed up, and this one felt nerfed. Either a lower reasoning variant or a quantized setup for broader roll out. The floor plan dropped in quality. The panda looked less cohesive. The chess demo worked, but played dumb captures. The Pokeball still worked, but it lost that extra polish. People on Twitter went wild with Web OS style demos. But those prompts are not good benchmarks. A single HTML and CSS file with a few panels is easy. Sonnet, GPT-5, Claude, almost all of them can do that in one shot. That's not how you judge spatial logic, math or deeper reasoning. 3.JS with real math is where models separate themselves. On that ECPT checkpoint, the Minecraft scene was laggy and flat. The butterfly sim was fine, but not great. The Blender Pokeball lost the nice lighting and camera setup. It still passed math questions like the pentagon one, and it was better than Sonnet overall. But it did not feel like a generational upgrade anymore. That made me think it might be Flash or a low thinking Pro variant. Then came the bounce back. X28. A lot of people said it might be the new Pro checkpoint, and it felt like a step above 2HT. I tested it again with the same 11 questions, and added a couple of new ones. The floor plan went from good to this is real. Proper doors, a sensible layout, and nicer furniture with lighting controls. You could drag furniture around. It was consistent too. The same prompt produced similar, coherent layouts across runs. That consistency matters a lot, because Sonnet tends to vary more. The SVG panda looked like it was actually eating the burger, not just posing with it. The 3JS Pokeball got colorful backgrounds and better polish. The Minecraft scene had rivers and cleaner lighting. The butterfly sim looked excellent with rocks and flowers. It still clipped sometimes, but it was easily among the best I've seen. The Rust CLI for image conversion worked. The Blender script regained the proper lighting and camera. I also tried a degree of separation network simulation with a slider and regeneration controls. It nailed it first try with a clean UI and no default purple vibes. It paid attention to typography and spacing. In tool calling via Ru's human relay, the first function selection was on point. One call will not prove big pipelines, but it is promising. Overall, I called it a 5 to 10% improvement over 2HT, and still a big leap over current Sonnet and the others on my real prompts. So here is the recap of quirks across all these checkpoints without making this complicated. The stronger checkpoints feel like thinking variants. You notice that with a slow first token and steady output after that. There are no visible traces, but you can feel the extra deliberation. Consistency is unusually good on the high-end checkpoints. If Google keeps that in the public release, it will be huge for people building apps who need something close to deterministic behavior across regenerations. UI and visual taste are legitimately strong. It picks fonts and layouts like a real designer sometimes. There is less of that generic vibe-coded look. Tool calling is the hinge. The raw reasoning is excellent, but we need the model to chain function calls reliably in live agents. If they really trained for Gemini CLI and Jewels patterns, this could be a great pairing for real work. The nerfed checkpoints probably exist so they can test safety, latency and serving limits. That is fine. I just hope the public Pro is closer to X28 or 2HT than ECPT. On pricing, my stance has not changed. If it lands around Sonnet pricing, I am fine with that because the performance in the good checkpoints justifies it. If they price it higher than Sonnet, they will need to justify it with tool call reliability, strong throughput and consistent quality across long sessions. If they go below Sonnet, it will pull a lot of users, especially given how strong the product surface is right now. Gemini CLI keeps getting better. Jewels is maturing. AI Studios generators are improving, and the ecosystem is more complete than most. The model was the bottleneck. If Gemini 3 Pro is as good as the strong checkpoints, that bottleneck goes away. How does it compare? On my prompts, the best Gemini 3 checkpoints are at or above Opus for generative code polish. Clearly ahead of Sonnet 4.5 in spatial reasoning and one-shot 3D scenes, and competitive with GPT-5 on math and consistency. GPT-5 sometimes edges on certain physics-like sims. But Gemini 3's consistency and UI taste win many practical tasks. The caveat is the checkpoint variability. If the launch build looks like ECPT, it is still good, and still better than Sonnet for many devy workflows, but not a new 3.5 Sonnet moment. If it is closer to X28 or 2HT, then yes, this is that moment. Release timing looks promising. The Vertex listing with 11-2025 makes me think preview is imminent. Google likes to build hype with rolling checkpoints, but we are at the point where it makes sense to just ship. My best guess is Pro preview first, Flash alongside or right after, then iterative bumps. Ultra is a question mark. I do not think it launches in the old app first way they used before. But performance wise, some of these checkpoints felt Ultra tier. Either way, I care less about labels and more about what is actually served at launch. I want to see the reasoning depth, the tool call accuracy, and whether the consistency holds up under load. For anyone benchmarking, keep a few things in mind, even if you are not running the exact same suite. Do not rely on those Web OS style demos to judge capability. They are easy wins, and almost every frontier model can do them. Push the model with 3D, with math, and with multi-file tool flows if you want to see the real differences. Check response stability across regenerations, because it matters more than people think. Measure latency to first token and also measure how consistently it handles the same prompt after a couple of retries. And if you are testing agents, look for whether it plans properly across steps. Not just whether it calls a function once. So, yeah. That is the recap. From the first AB tests with 2HT to the dip with ECPT, to the strong rebound with X28, I have seen enough to be cautiously optimistic. If Google ships something close to the stronger checkpoints, this will be the best mainstream model for builders right now. If we get the nerfed variant, it is still good. Just not the big leap I was hoping for. Either way, I will run the full benchmark suite the moment the public preview lands in Vertex. And I will share token economics, latency numbers, and tool call pass rates so we can get a clear price to performance picture. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye!"

Russia's got, what is it, three times the population or something of Ukraine. The death rate that it's suffering is really high. And these are only children. Look at from Xi Jinping- Oh, the longer this goes on, ain't the better. Just let Putin keep on working his magic. And I get to sell him stuff. I'll get him to lower the prices of resources because the man's desperate, and Putin will find himself under a Chinese yoke that he does not like. And then at some point, the Russians will reassess. And I don't think they'll like that. The Russians fancy themselves being Europeans and have a whole, I believe, racist package that goes with the Chinese. So that they won't like that whole situation."
