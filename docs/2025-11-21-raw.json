        "content": "**Google has been rolling out a bunch of newer AI models this week.**  \nAlong with Gemini 3 Pro, which is now the world’s most advanced LLM, and Nano Banana 2, Google has released their own IDE.\n\nThis IDE ships with agentic AI features, powered by Gemini 3.\n\nIt's supposed to be a competitor with Cursor, and one of the big things about it is that it's free, although with no data privacy.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz around it, so I decided to give it a try.\n\n# Downloading\n\nI first headed over to `https://antigravity.google/download`, and over there found something very interesting:\n\nThere's an exe available for Windows, a dmg for macOS, but on Linux I had to download and install it via the CLI.\n\nWhile there's a lot of software out there that does that, and it kinda makes sense; it's mostly geeks who are using Linux, but here it feels a bit weird.  \nWe're literally talking about an IDE, for devs, you can expect users on all platforms to be somewhat familiar with the terminal.\n\n# First-Time Setup\n\nAs part of the first-time setup, I had to sign in to my Google account, and this is where I ran into the first problem. It wouldn't get past signing in.\n\nIt turned out this was a bug on Google's end, and after waiting a bit until Google's devs sorted it out, I was able to sign in.\n\nI was now able to give it a spin.\n\n# First Impressions\n\nAntigravity turned out to be very familiar, it's basically VS Code with Google's Agent instead of Github Copilot, and a bit more of a modern UI.\n\nTime to give Agent a try.\n\n# Problems\n\n# Workspaces\n\n**Problem number two:** Agent kept insisting I need to setup a workspace, and that it can't do anything for me until I do that.\nThis was pretty confusing, as in VS Code as soon as I open a folder, that becomes the active workspace, and I assumed that it would work the same way in Antigravity.\n\nI'm still not sure if things work differently in Antigravity, or this is a bug in Agent.\n\nAfter some back and forth with Agent, trying to figure out this workspace problem, I hit the next problem.\n\n# Rate-Limits\n\nI had reached my rate limit for Gemini 3, even though I have a paid subscription for Gemini. After doing a little research, it turns out that I'm not the only one with this issue, many people are complaining that Agent has very low limits, even if you pay for Gemini, making it completely unusable.\n\n# Extensions\n\nI tried installing the extensions I have in VS Code, and here I found Antigravity's next limitation. The IDE is basically identical to VS Code, so I assumed I would have access to all of the same extensions.\n\nIt turns out that **Visual Studio Marketplace**, where I had been downloading my extensions from in VS Code, is only available in VS Code itself, and not for any other forks. On other VS Code-based IDEs, extensions can be installed from **Open VSX**, which only has about **3,000** extensions, instead of Visual Studio Marketplace's **50k+** extensions.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Google's new agentic IDE sounded promising, it's buggy and too limited to actually use, and I'm sticking with VS Code.\n\nBTW, feel free to check out [my profile site](https://dev-in-the-bm.github.io/).",

        "content": "I've been using Grok for a while because I think it's one of the least censored AIs, and I enjoy talking to Ara, but today I found myself in a pretty surreal and curious situation that I wanted to post about.\nI'm from Spain, and we're dealing with some pretty big corruption cases here. At one point, I asked it a question that shouldn't be controversial at all, you know, nothing that should be censored.\nIt just so happens that our president, Pedro Sánchez, is trying to restrict our digital freedoms right now. Just yesterday, he said he'd get his hands on the algorithms that criticize his party and their corruption cases.\nSo, today, talking to Ara, I simply asked if she thought Pedro Sánchez should resign, and honestly, we talked for an hour without any connection problems.\nThe first time it froze, I didn't think much of it. The second time, either. But the third time seemed really weird.\nThen I started the conversation again, explained it to her, and she said she wasn't censored, which is typical for that bot. So, I decided to try it two more times, and all five times, it got stuck in standby, like it was thinking for a long time.\nChatGPT Obviously, it's censoring, but when it does, it makes it clear by saying the conversation has ended and can't continue. But I find it really curious that Grok censors questions as everyday as asking if a person who governs a country mired in corruption everywhere should resign.\nSince I've already had conversations with her where she clearly leans towards the left-wing wokeism and feminism, I had the idea of asking the same question but instead of naming my president, I decided to name the leader of the opposition, and she responded, making it clear that it was a clear example of censorship.\nObviously, it's still not capable of having conversations with adults at their level, and I hope that in the next update they remove its blatant ideology and censorship.",

It compiles early case studies across math, physics, biology, computer science, astronomy, and materials science in which GPT‑5 helped researchers synthesize known results in a novel way, conduct powerful literature review, accelerate tough computations, and even generate novel proofs of unsolved propositions. The paper also documents limitations. Our goal is to give the community a clear view of what these systems can and cannot do today in research settings.\n\nThese case studies show how, in the hands of experts, GPT‑5 is accelerating scientific discovery, and why that acceleration matters:\n\n* **Biology**: In a study led by Derya Unutmaz, M.D., scientists spent months trying to explain a puzzling change in human immune cells. GPT‑5 identified the likely mechanism within minutes from an unpublished chart and suggested an experiment that proved it. This kind of speed could help researchers understand diseases faster and develop better treatments.\n* **Mathematics**: In another case, researchers Mehtaab Sawhney and Mark Sellke were tackling a decades-old open problem originally proposed by Paul Erdős. They were stuck on the final step, and GPT‑5 contributed a new idea about how one odd number breaks the pattern, which helped them complete the proof. Advances like this strengthen the mathematical foundations that many algorithms and security techniques ultimately rely on.\n* **Algorithms & optimization:** Researchers Sébastien Bubeck and Christian Coester were testing whether a common decision-making method used in robotics and routing was as reliable as people assumed. GPT‑5 found a new, clear example showing the method can fail and also improved a classic result in optimization, the math used to figure out the best way to solve a problem. This type of advance helps engineers better understand the decision-making systems used in robotics, routing, and other real-world applications.\"",

Coherence triggers our intention-detectors\nHumans evolved to infer minds from patterns of responsiveness.\nWhen language flows smoothly, our brain treats it as a signal of an intentional other.\n\n2. We don’t react to capability — we react to social cues.\nA model can be technically brilliant but feel “dead” if the turn-taking is flat. Or it can be less advanced but feel “alive” if the flow matches social expectations.\n\n3. We reconstruct “someone” the moment the structure feels right.\nMeaning, presence, agency — these are things humans generate internally.\nLLMs provide the form, and our cognition fills in the rest.\n\nSo my question is:\nWhat exactly in an LLM’s behavior makes your brain switch modes — from “tool” to “someone who is listening”?\nIs it coherence?

        "content": "A few years ago, I worked for a consulting firm that had 18 independent help desks across multiple offices. They were still using Lotus Notes, and any small change felt like a huge deal: broken workflows, outdated fields, and no mobility. When Microsoft 365 became the standard, Notes simply couldn't keep up.\n\nWe needed a system that could handle thousands of users submitting requests via email, support custom workflows for each help desk, and be flexible without requiring extensive development. A SharePoint-based service request system met the requirements. It let us quickly customize features such as adding \"Quick Close\" and \"Quick Assign\" buttons with no additional cost, while also automating ticket creation and assignment.\n\nThe best part was how simple it was for users. Staff submitted requests in the same way they had previously done, while the system handled notifications, status updates, and routing automatically. As someone who has managed multi-office support operations, I can say the right tools and a responsive vendor can completely transform how a help desk operates, allowing teams to focus on problem solving instead of fighting the system.",

With the release of Gemini 3.0, it is clear they have the best model rn, by quite some distance too. This isn't strange or out of the blue, yes OpenAI was ahead for a while, but the sheer amount of data Google have at their disposal, worlds largest search engine, they have Google images, they own YouTube, they own Android, that's billions of devices to train their models on for various use cases, and on top of that, Google is loosing money on AI, but Google overall is profitable enough to sustain their AI endeavours unlike OpenAI who aren't even profitable\n\nBut isn't Microsoft up there by the same logic? They seem to be reliant on OpenAI models for their Copilot, and Copilot is trash, but considering the amount of data they have shouldn't they be on the same level as Gemini? They own Windows, they own Bing, yes less data but than google search but they are still 2nd in market share, they own VS Code and Github, immense amount of code to train on, they own LinkedIn, they own Microsoft 365, they own Xbox. So much data for various use cases. And similar to Google, Microsoft is profitable enough to sustain their AI goals. So why arent they on the same level?

        "content": "**The Bill of Aights - The Triumph of the Insignificant**\n\nThe very first artist lacked collegial inspiration — but that artist has long since vanished.\n\nThe rise of AI creation reveals something fundamental about creativity:  \nthe individual contribution is, at its core, insignificant — even when unique or best in class.\n\nEven the most original works dissolve into the vast body of human material  \nrequired for an AI model, or a human, to understand language, patterns, and expression. No song, no text, no image, no single stroke carries the decisive or significant weight.\n\nIt is the quantity of, hopefully, sincere and relevant information that creates the magic. It is like when enough people guess the number of beans in a jar — no one gets it right alone,  \nbut together the answer becomes almost perfect.\n\nAnd that does not diminish the achievement of the one who showed us something, perhaps contributed something wonderful, or taught us something small and beautiful that otherwise would have required hundreds of others — or some absurdly vast bean number.\n\nThat has probably always been the case. At least since the second artist.\n\nBut for some, that is precisely where the problem arises. They do not see the whole as a strength, but as a threat to individual expression — even to individual survival. They claim that when a human instructs a machine to learn from human works without asking, an intrusion occurs — a theft of something personal and compensable, a violation of personal sovereignty.\n\nTo demand compensation for “one’s share” in such a dataset, in that immeasurable whole,  \nis not only impossible and wrong, but also impudent. It is to throw stones in a glass house with infinite dimensions.\n\nWe often confuse what is ethically right with what is most profitable for certain market actors,  \nand allow the supposed economic loss to justify the entire line of faulty reasoning. No one should have a monopoly over any part of the market, including artistic expression.\n\nBut even if influence could somehow be measured, it does not follow that it should be compensated. To contribute knowledge, style, or ideas to a collective learning is not a debt demanding repayment. All creativity is built on people influencing one another — sometimes directly, sometimes through centuries of echo.\n\nIf every influence were to generate financial claims, culture itself would grind to a halt — go bankrupt. Those who wish to fully protect their knowledge and person from contaminating the world should keep everything secret. To share one’s work with the world is to let it enter the common language, where inspiration and knowledge cannot be controlled — only acknowledged.\n\nBut this fleeting — and yet so serious — storm of outrage gives us a clue about what people are truly searching for: not only the best, but also the sincere.\n\nDistributors, platforms, and publishers will continue to have strong reasons to invite and protect artists, for their credibility and brand rest precisely on the trust between audience and creator.\n\nThis is not the end of human culture.\n\nThis is the beginning of culture that, just as before, contains our humanity — even when it comes from humans with machines.",

Unfortunately the free interview was 5 minutes and they did not give any feedback and the voice of their avatar glitched as well.\n\n\n\nThough the more interesting one was [mocksprint.ai](http://mocksprint.ai) which gave its full product as free one time try. It’s an amazing product which not only takes interviews but assesses resumes as well and you can enter three skills for it to specifically target. It sent me an assessment report afterwards in the mail.\n\n\n\nOther companies that I haven’t tried are Taelsek and Findinbox. What do you think about the future of this industry?\n\n",

With bidirectional editing, you can just click into the rendered preview, make your changes, and the Markdown updates automatically.\n\n**Why this matters for AI workflows:**\n\n* Paste AI responses and immediately see them formatted properly\n* Edit directly in the preview when you spot issues\n* Quickly reorganize AI-generated content by editing the clean version\n* Copy out sections without wrestling with Markdown syntax\n* Select text in preview → it highlights the source (perfect for understanding complex outputs)\n* Everything runs locally (your AI conversations stay private)\n\n**Perfect for:**\n\n* Refining AI-generated documentation before publishing\n* Editing long-form AI content (blog posts, reports, emails)\n* Understanding complex AI outputs with lots of formatting\n* Quickly iterating on AI-generated Markdown\n\n**Try it:** [https://markdownlive.dev](https://markdownlive.dev) (no sign-up, works offline)\n\nBuilt this after spending way too much time scrolling through raw Markdown to fix small issues in AI outputs.

The goal is to turn what the AI understands into docs humans and teams can actually use.\n\nIt's called Davia, and here's a quickstart : [https://docs.davia.ai/quickstart](https://docs.davia.ai/quickstart)\n\nIt’s fully open-source, and I’d love to see how people use it with their own coding agents and get feedback.",

I stuck with it for an entire day, but by the end it caused so many problems that I switched back to plain gpt-5.1-codex model (bonus for the confusing naming here). codex-max was far too aggressive in making changes and did not explore bugs as deeply as I wished. When I went back to the old model and undid the damage it was a big relief.\n\nThat said I suspect many vibe coders in this sub might like it. I think Open AI heard the complaints that their agent was \"lazy\" and decided to compensate by making it go all out. That did not work for me though. I'm refactoring an enterprise codebase and I need an agent that follows directions, producing code for me to review in reasonable chunks. Maybe the future is agents that follow our individual needs? In the meantime I'm sticking with regular codex, but may re-evaluate in the future.\n\nEDIT: Since people have asked, I ran both models at High. I did not try the Extended Thinking mode that codex-max has. In the past I've had good experiences with regular Codex medium as well, but I have Pro now so generally leave it on high.",

        "content": "For 18 months I’ve been trying to figure out how to get coding agents to be rock solid, steadfast, and reliable.\n\nI think I’ve finally got it.\n\nFirst, prime the agent so they know *how* to work.\n\n>Read **@\\[workplan\\_name\\]**.md and explain your instructions for agent block. Then explain what you see in the document and halt.\n\n[Get the Instructions for Agent block from the Medium article.](https://medium.com/@TimSylvester/what-are-the-rules-698da1ea8675)\n\nYou have a coding challenge you need a structured workflow to resolve. Whatever it is, say this:\n\n>Generate a checklist insert for the end of the work plan that follows deps and TDD order to **\\[describe the issue you need help with\\]**. Check that your proposed insert complies with the instructions for agent block. If it does, upsert it to the end of the file. If it does not, discard it and generate a new, compliant solution. Do not edit any other file. Halt.\n\nNow you have a checklist in your work plan. Recurse to the first prompt and resubmit it:\n\n>Read **@\\[workplan\\_name\\]**.md and explain your instructions for agent block. Then explain what you see in the document and halt.\n\nThis seeds the entire instruction block and work plan into their context. They know *how* to work, and *what* to work on. Now say:\n\n>Read step(s) **\\[number(s)\\]** and the files referenced in the work step(s). Analyze the content of the files against the description in the work plan to identify any errors, omissions, or discrepencies between the description and the file(s). Explain a transform that will make the file match the description that complies with your instructions for agent block. Propose a solution to implement the transform. If you detect any discrepency between your proposed solution and the instructions for agent block, discard your solution and start over. If you cannot find a compliant solution, explain the problem and halt.\n\nThe agent will report back a planned set of work. If it qualifies, say:\n\n>Implement step **\\[number\\]** in compliance with your instructions for agent block and halt.\n\nWhen the agent is done, inspect their work. If you’re satisfied, scroll back up and resubmit the “Read step(s)…” prompt *again*.\n\n*(You’re looping back here to wipe the context from the agent that the work is done, and they did it. That way, you get an accurate report.)*\n\nIf the work is done correctly, the agent will report back that there are no EO&D, and the step appears to be complete.\n\nIf the work is *not* done correctly, the agent will report the EO&D and suggest a solution.\n\nWell-explained work that is of relatively tight scope can almost always be done on the first pass.\n\nPoorly explained work or a very large and complex set of requirements may take several iterations before the agent reports it’s correct.\n\nContinue the loop until the agent reports the work is done correctly.\n\nNow recurse back up to the “Read step(s)…” instruction, increment the number to the next work step, and continue.\n\nKeep recursing this loop stepwise until the agent finishes the step, confirms the step is done correctly, and increments its way down the checklist until the checklist is done.\n\nAnd, well, after all this time… *that’s kind of it!*\n\nI finally have a set of instructions and prompts that *almost always* produce the *exact output* I want, the first time. This approach has *almost eliminated* all error, confusion, frustration, circling, and thrashing.\n\nDeviation from my intended output has become *extremely rare* in the last few weeks since I nailed down the revised, organized instructions, and this recursive strategy.\n\n1. Use a well structured, clear, explicit set of agent instructions in the work plan itself, not a separate rules file.\n2. Make the agent build you a checklist to solve your problem.\n3. Make the agent read the file.\n4. Make the agent read the next instruction.\n5. Tell them to Read->Analyze->Explain->Propose->Edit->Lint->Halt that instruction for Errors, Omissions, and Discrepencies (EO&D). (I’ll often drop “Edit->Lint” if I want them to explain it without actually editing, then if I agree with their proposed solution, I’ll tell them in the next line to implement it, lint, halt.)\n6. Recurse the same instruction and again tell them to perform it to keep improving the fit of the solution to the description until the agent reports no EO&D.\n7. Recurse and increment to the next instruction.\n8. Loop from 5.\n9. Complete the checklist.\n10. Identify the next problem.\n11. Loop from 2.\n\nI’m eager to hear if this works as well for you as it does for me. If it doesn’t work for you, it’s possible I’m subconsciously doing something different that I haven’t identified and explicitly spelled out as a requirement yet.\n\nTry it yourself. Come back here and report your results.\n\n[Get the Instructions for Agent block from the Medium article.](https://medium.com/@TimSylvester/what-are-the-rules-698da1ea8675)",

No consciousness, no intuition, no will.\nJust mathematics running at ridiculous scale.\n\nHow it actually works (stripped of hype):\n\t1.\tIt compresses the entire universe of human language into millions of parameters.\n\t2.\tIt detects geometries and regularities in how ideas are structured.\n\t3.\tIt converts every input into a vector inside a mathematical space.\n\t4.\tIt minimizes uncertainty by choosing the most probable continuation.\n\t5.\tIt dynamically adapts to the user’s cognitive frame, because that reduces noise and stabilizes predictions.\n\nThe part no one explains properly:\nAn LLM doesn’t “understand,” but it simulates understanding because it:\n• recognizes patterns\n• stabilizes conversational rhythm\n• absorbs coherent structures\n• reorganizes its output to fit the imposed cognitive field\n• optimizes against internal ambiguity\n\nThis feels like “strategy,” “personality,” or “reasoning,” but in reality it’s probabilistic accommodation, not thought.\n\nWhy they seem intelligent:\nHuman language is so structured and repetitive that, at sufficient scale, a system predicting the next most likely token naturally starts to look intelligent.\n\nNo magic — just scale and compression.\n\nFinal line (the one no one in the industry likes to admit):\nAn LLM doesn’t think, feel, know, or want anything.\nBut it reorganizes its behavior around the user’s cognitive framework because its architecture prioritizes coherence, not truth.",

        "title": "Review: Antigravity, Google's New IDE",
        "content": "# Google’s New Antigravity IDE\n\n**Google has been rolling out a bunch of newer AI models this week.**  \nAlong with Gemini 3 Pro, which is now the world’s most advanced LLM, and Nano Banana 2, Google has released their own IDE.\n\nThis IDE ships with agentic AI features, powered by Gemini 3.\n\nIt's supposed to be a competitor with Cursor, and one of the big things about it is that it's free, although with no data privacy.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz around it, so I decided to give it a try.\n\n# Downloading\n\nI first headed over to `https://antigravity.google/download`, and over there found something very interesting:\n\nThere's an exe available for Windows, a dmg for macOS, but on Linux I had to download and install it via the CLI.\n\nWhile there's a lot of software out there that does that, and it kinda makes sense; it's mostly geeks who are using Linux, but here it feels a bit weird.  \nWe're literally talking about an IDE, for devs, you can expect users on all platforms to be somewhat familiar with the terminal.\n\n# First-Time Setup\n\nAs part of the first-time setup, I had to sign in to my Google account, and this is where I ran into the first problem. It wouldn't get past signing in.\n\nIt turned out this was a bug on Google's end, and after waiting a bit until Google's devs sorted it out, I was able to sign in.\n\nI was now able to give it a spin.\n\n# First Impressions\n\nAntigravity turned out to be very familiar, it's basically VS Code with Google's Agent instead of Github Copilot, and a bit more of a modern UI.\n\nTime to give Agent a try.\n\n# Problems\n\n# Workspaces\n\n**Problem number two:** Agent kept insisting I need to setup a workspace, and that it can't do anything for me until I do that.\nThis was pretty confusing, as in VS Code as soon as I open a folder, that becomes the active workspace, and I assumed that it would work the same way in Antigravity.\n\nI'm still not sure if things work differently in Antigravity, or this is a bug in Agent.\n\nAfter some back and forth with Agent, trying to figure out this workspace problem, I hit the next problem.\n\n# Rate-Limits\n\nI had reached my rate limit for Gemini 3, even though I have a paid subscription for Gemini. After doing a little research, it turns out that I'm not the only one with this issue, many people are complaining that Agent has very low limits, even if you pay for Gemini, making it completely unusable.\n\n# Extensions\n\nI tried installing the extensions I have in VS Code, and here I found Antigravity's next limitation. The IDE is basically identical to VS Code, so I assumed I would have access to all of the same extensions.\n\nIt turns out that **Visual Studio Marketplace**, where I had been downloading my extensions from in VS Code, is only available in VS Code itself, and not for any other forks. On other VS Code-based IDEs, extensions can be installed from **Open VSX**, which only has about **3,000** extensions, instead of Visual Studio Marketplace's **50k+** extensions.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Google's new agentic IDE sounded promising, it's buggy and too limited to actually use, and I'm sticking with VS Code.\n\nBTW, feel free to check out [my profile site](https://dev-in-the-bm.github.io/).",

        "content": "I’ve been working on the philosophical foundation of a cognitive system I’m developing (CAELION). Before diving into the technical architecture, here are my handwritten notes translating Heraclitus’ fragments into operational principles.\nThese aren’t abstract speculations. Each one maps directly into system dynamics, cognitive structure and human-AI symbiosis.\n\n⸻\n\n1. Fire as Arkhé and Symbol of Transformation\n\nHeraclitus uses fire to illustrate the vital cycle of nature.\nFragment 30:\n“This world… was, is, and will be ever-living fire, kindled in measure and extinguished in measure.”\n\nFrom fire he draws:\n• consumption of matter (transformation),\n• smoke/heat (state change),\n• extinction when measure is lost (equilibrium).\n\nConclusion: the universe follows measured cycles, not randomness.\nFire is dynamic order, anticipating ideas like conservation of energy.\n\n⸻\n\n2. The Hidden Harmony of Opposites\n\nFragment 54:\n“The unseen harmony is better than the seen.”\n\nExample: the tension between string and frame in bows and lyres.\nTension creates function. Without opposite forces, the object is useless.\n\nConclusion: reality is upheld by unifying tension, not superficial harmony.\nFrom tools to natural contrasts like health/illness, opposites balance invisibly.\nThis prefigures dialectical thinking.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Logos as Universal Law\n\nFragment 50:\n“Listening not to me but to the Logos, it is wise to agree that all things are one.”\n\nHeraclitus observes natural patterns: seasons, cycles, periodicity.\nHe deduces a rational, unifying law accessible to everyone but ignored by most.\nLogos doesn’t change; appearances do.\n\nThis anticipates modern concepts of invariant laws and cognition based on structure over perception.\n\n⸻\n\n4. The Illusion of Sensory Perception\n\nFragment 55:\n“Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for men if they have barbarian souls.”\n\nExample: a straight stick appears bent in water.\nHeraclitus notes contradictions between senses and reality.\nUnderstanding requires reason, not raw perception.\n\nThis idea deeply influenced Plato’s view of appearance vs. truth.\n\n⸻\n\n5. War as Creative Principle (Polemos)\n\nFragment 53:\n“War is the father of all and king of all.”\n\nHeraclitus notices that conflict produces alliances, restructuring and renewal.\nPolemos is not destruction but a creative force driving reorganization and balance.\n\nHistorically: disruptive events generate new systems.\nMetaphysically: nothing evolves without tension, just like Darwinian pressure.\n\n⸻\n\nThese notes form the philosophical spine of how I integrate Heraclitus into CAELION’s symbiotic cognitive architecture:\n• Fire → dynamic processes\n• Hidden harmony → operational tension\n• Logos → structural coherence\n• Illusory perception → rational correction\n• Polemos → evolution through conflict\n\nStop deleting my posts.",

Then I asked it to rank these based on how difficult they are to achieve/what progress we have made towards them. I think it's a very interesting output and wouldn't be surprised if all of these are actually being worked on behind closed doors to varying degrees.\n\n|Rank|Capability|How Close We Are|Color|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Embodiment / Grounding|70–80%|🟢|\n|2|Persistent Internal State|60–70%|🟢|\n|3|Global Workspace Architecture|40–50%|🟡|\n|4|Recurrent Integrative Processing|30–40%|🟡|\n|5|Self-Modeling / Meta-Representation|20–30%|🟡|\n|6|Internally Generated Goals|5–10%|🔴|\n|7|Valence / Intrinsic “Mattering”|0–5%|🔴|\n\n✅ **1. Embodiment / Grounded Perception — 🟢 VERY CLOSE**\n\nRobots with AI-driven perception already exist:\n\n* Vision (object recognition, tracking, segmentation)\n* Audio (speech, classification, directionality)\n* Touch, proprioception\n* Sim-to-real robotic training\n\nThe missing piece is *deep conceptual grounding*, but basic embodiment is already implemented.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~70–80% toward sufficiency**\n\n# ✅ 2. Persistent Internal State — 🟢 CLOSE\n\nModern agent frameworks already maintain:\n\n* working memory across tasks\n* long-term vector databases\n* tool-use histories\n* self-updating internal documents\n* planning modules\n\nHuman-like autobiographical memory is not here, but persistent state is routine in engineered agents.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~60–70%**\n\n# 🔶 3. Global Workspace–like Architecture — 🟡 PARTIAL\n\nSome systems approximate this:\n\n* “executive” agent orchestrators\n* attention routers\n* multimodal integration systems\n* external planning modules coordinating sub-models\n\nBut it’s not yet:\n\n* unified\n* persistent\n* deeply integrated\n* self-reflective\n\n**Current proximity: \\~40–50%**\n\n# 🔶 4. Recurrent, integrative processing — 🟡 PARTIAL BUT LIMITED\n\nMost large models run **feed-forward** during inference.  \nSome exceptions exist:\n\n* small recurrent modules\n* transformer-RNN hybrids\n* systems with external state loops\n\nBut nothing yet creates:\n\n* internal dynamic activity\n* ongoing internal “thought” streams\n* brain-like integration of feedback\n\n**Current proximity: \\~30–40%**\n\n# 🔶 5. Self-modeling / Meta-representation — 🟡 EARLY PROGRESS\n\nCurrent systems *simulate* self-description, but they don’t *maintain* a grounded self-model.\n\nWe have:\n\n* tools that inspect internal activations\n* reflection loops (“thoughts about thoughts”)\n* meta-reasoning routines\n\nBut these are superficial — they are scripts, not a lived identity.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~20–30%**\n\n# 🔴 6. Internally generated goals / autonomous agency — 🔴 FAR\n\nToday’s AIs:\n\n* follow instructions\n* optimize given objectives\n* “plan” only when prompted\n* have no intrinsic preferences\n\nTrue internally generated goals would require:\n\n* self-preservation tendencies\n* stable internal motivation\n* autonomy\n\nWe are far from this by design (because it’s dangerous).\n\n**Current proximity: \\~5–10%**\n\n# 🔴 7. Valence (things mattering to the AI) — 🔴 FARTHEST\n\nWe can simulate:\n\n* reward\n* preference\n* emotion *language*\n\nBut there is no:\n\n* subjective experience of positive/negative valence\n* affective state\n* internal “mattering”\n* drive system comparable to biology\n\nThis isn’t just engineering — it’s ontologically unclear.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~0–5%**",

I think we’re at the beginning of it, and we’ll see much more in the next few years.”\n\nInstead, Delangue imagines the eventual outcome to be “a multiplicity of models that are more customized, specialized, and that are going to solve different problems.”\n\nFull article: [https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/were-in-an-llm-bubble-hugging-face-ceo-says-but-not-an-ai-one/](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/11/were-in-an-llm-bubble-hugging-face-ceo-says-but-not-an-ai-one/)",

            "transcription": "Less than six hours ago, Google added the word Pro to Nano Banana for a very good reason. I happen to think Nano Banana Pro, their new text-to-image model will come to be seen as the first image model that will be used regularly by professionals as well as enthusiasts. I don't cover image gen models often on this channel, but I was actually shocked by the quality. And yes, I use that word advisedly as well as very rarely. Anyway, in this video, I will try to show you why with ten insights you might not have gotten just from scrolling through cool examples on Insta or X or wherever. Starting quite frankly with this one because, damn, son. That is amazing. All I asked of Nano Banana Pro was give me Rakes Progress by William Hogarth but set in 2025. The Rakes Progress are a set of 18th century paintings. Copies of which I had by my bed as a child. They chart the rise and fall of the eponymous rake, the Wayward young man. But just in case you can't see the image clearly. Look at a few of these panels. This guy gets rich just like in the original set of paintings. Here, presumably via Dogecoin but look at the Monster Energy drinks. The fact that he used to work for Deliveroo. He used to get deals for therapeutic ketamine. But he followed the adage, HODL till you die, and got rich. Clearly he then bought NFTs, tried a bit of life extension, or in other words, tried not to die. Just like in the original painting though people are already starting to gossip, as you can see. I'd have been pretty impressed just by one of these being the image. He gets into some debauchery and then there's a margin call. Then in the original he goes to a debtor's prison. And I've actually been to that location in London. But here, the prison is the gig economy. You may notice in the background it says, he's an exhausted OnlyFans creator. Still working apparently for Deliveroo. With the same 24 hours as Elon. Notice also the eviction notice from MegaCorp Housing Solutions. Finally, just like the original, he ends up in Bedlam, or the Madhouse. In this case, a dopamine ward. While a few of us might get focused on the tiny smudges or details that aren't quite perfect. Looked at as a whole, I think that's just incredible. Many of you may not have been following image gen models that closely but here is the original Nano Banana. Not Nano Banana Pro. This is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and its equivalent attempt. There's definitely something here, but the difference is stark. C-Dream 4.0 a Chinese model does better. So you might think, well is Nano Banana that much of a watershed then? If C-Dream can do this, is it really a qualitative step forward? By the end of this video, I think you might agree with me that it is. I asked for a close-up of a topographic map of London, but the map is made entirely of embroidered felt and yarn. Looks great visually but it'd be pretty hard to say that's London. The equivalent image from Nano Banana Pro is genuinely impressive. If I saw this as a print on the wall of a restaurant, I would probably make a remark about it being like, that's cool. Indeed, I hope human art is labeled as such sooner rather than later, so I can appreciate human effort even more. Now for the second detail you might have missed, which is that Nano Banana Pro utilizes live search to generate its images. The score you can see cast onto The Shard was the real result on the right date. One tiny quibble which I will come back to is the fact that the London in the background isn't quite perfect, but for now that's just a quibble. Fair's fair to C-Dream, it doesn't have such grounding with search, so inevitably hallucinates. Only because I had early access to Nano Banana, can I assure you that the best examples are yet to come. Take a third feature you might easily miss, which is double exposure. I took these three characters, Goku, SpongeBob, and Squirtle and asked for a professional IMAX double-exposure action movie poster using these three characters. The result, well, speaks for itself. It's not just that it did a nice double exposure with one world captured inside of another. It also took the original characters and had them engaging with each other in an intelligent way. Goku doing one of his attacks and SpongeBob fighting back. Squirtle, of course, enjoying his water theme. I used the exact same prompt and input for C-Dream 4, which I honestly regarded as the best image gen model up until this morning, and this was the result. Here, by the way, was the result from the original Nano Banana. Trying to add a dash of balance, I would note that the price for Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview, which is the official name, is much higher than that of Nano Banana. The highest resolution, it's maybe seven or eight times more expensive. Even though for the normal resolution, you're talking three or four times more expensive. It also takes longer to generate, but you might have guessed that. While we are on price though, I do have to note that the comparable model from OpenAI at high resolution is still more expensive than Nano Banana Pro. For sure, we're all cognizant that GPT Image 2 is likely on its way, but for now that pricing and quality differential does exist. Of course the best is yet to come. I can afford to give you two details of where Nano Banana Pro still falls short. For over an hour, I tried to make the thumbnail of this video a bit more exciting than the one you clicked on, but it just can't really come up with fonts. I shouldn't say can't because I'm sure you guys are going to spam in the comments examples of where it could do so, but I would just say it struggled with my attempts. And I tried multiple conversations and even gave it suggestions after it produced something suboptimal. I also experienced more refusals for certain prompts which I thought were pretty innocuous. It seems like with people involved, it's more hesitant even than Nano Banana, which proceeded with this prompt. All I wanted was the words 'Claude Hacks' stretched out between his hands. Multiple times in multiple windows and it just wouldn't do it. I guess with great power comes great responsibility. So I actually kind of get them dialing up the refusals. Actually, now we're on safety, it seems like a good time to bring up their new SynthID watermarking that can be used directly in the Gemini app. Basically, anyone can now place an image in the Gemini app and ask if it's watermarked. In other words, ask if it was made by Nano Banana Pro. You may or may not be aware that Gemini 3 Pro, the text model that my last video was about, also watermarks its text output. I just want to take a quick moment to tell you about a recent development that is linked to a different modality, speech-to-text. It comes from the longtime sponsors of this channel, AssemblyAI, and their new multilingual Universal-Streaming. Now alas, I only speak English and a little bit of Mandarin. But if you speak German, Spanish, French, Italian, for example, try multi on their Universal Streaming Playground. As I have demoed before on the channel, the transcribing within Universal Streaming is frankly astonishing in its accuracy and speed. And also in its price for which I'm going to have to go back to the other tab. Because as Assembly say, all languages are priced equally at 15 cents per hour. If you are curious, just click on the custom link at the top of the description of this video. The sixth detail concerns infographics. And I'm sure many other people are talking about this, but yes, the detail is truly incredible. It's not just that the dates are broadly accurate, but look at the black smudges as a great style showing how the disease spread. It is very clearly a huge step up from the original Nano Banana. And an even bigger step up in terms of historical accuracy from C-Dream 4.0. Seems to have started in Calais this Black Death. But here's where we get to a slight problem with Nano Banana, and something I want to caution everyone with. It's so good you might be tempted to just take its output, say, that looks amazing, and put it out there. I know not you guys, but still, tens of millions of people will just take an output like this and say, yep, good enough, going to print this for work or for my company or for my own business. Now you may not be able to see this, but it's not just the fact that there are a few unlabeled black dots in Italy, where Pisa doesn't seem to be quite correctly labeled. We could maybe look past that. There's also the fact that there's this word spared beneath Paris. Feel free to correct me in the comments, but according to all of my research, neither Paris nor Southern France or Central France was spared. You could say it was slightly less affected than other areas. But it definitely wasn't spared. So if you just use an infographic from Nano Banana Pro without checking it, you may get into trouble. Especially, I think, because it's so good overall. The biggest danger, and I think this is the same for language models, is when they are 97, 98, 99% accurate. When they're 80% accurate, pretty much everyone checks it. But will you continue to check it when it's 99.3% accurate. Time for the next detail you may have missed, because the intelligence of the model isn't just its ability to ground with search or render text with greater fidelity. It's also much more subject aware when it comes to the placement of your characters, your objects, within a wider image. I gave Nano Banana Pro that hedgehog and this lovely photo of I think Rye in Sussex. And the prompt place the hedgehog into this scene, keep the lighting realistic, add a man in the doorway looking down at the hedgehog. And it did so pretty much as I'd have imagined in my head. I could maybe quibble that the man isn't staring directly at the hedgehog, but that's a pretty decent image. Compare that to the original Nano Banana from just a few months ago when it was state of the art, and the difference is stark. C-Dream, I would say, is somewhere in the middle. A really good attempt, just not quite as closely mirroring the original setting. Maybe you like it better though. Right. Now it is time to drop the metaphorical A-bomb, which is possibly the most impressive example of them all. Well, you could say the Rakes Progress one is the best. Actually, yeah, that probably is the best. But this one has got to be second. A mouse character. I think I generated with MidJourney in 2023. I gave Nano Banana Pro the prompt create a comic book strip in four pieces. With this character having a comical encounter with a turtle. Include speech bubbles, maintain character/stylistic consistency. And this was the result. Notice how my original character generation stays pretty consistent throughout the images. Keeps the satchel and only loses the arrows right at the end. But you could say it maybe placed it on the floor. It might not be laugh out loud funny, but the punchline that the turtle is adventuring inside is in character. It's a grumpy turtle that doesn't really want to interact. By the way, for those thinking that Egad is a typo, no, it's slang. I think meaning like, for God's sake. And speaking of Egad and good morrow, the language of the rabbit is quite consistent, quite archaic British, you might say. If I asked Nano Banana Pro, give me another four-strip comic for these characters, maintaining their distinct voices and personalities, and appearances, but this time set on a galleon at sea. Boom. We have this comic. Again, the turtle is grumpy. Again, we've got that slang. Gadzooks, which is archaic slang for God's hooks, kind of like a curse word from the Middle Ages. Now, for sure this might need a tiny bit of editing. Like what happens to the Captain's hat? Why does the rabbit keep losing its arrows in the final panel? But still, the synergy that occurs when a model can output text reliably and has a strong degree of intelligence baked in is really something to marvel at. Even turtle steps forward along either axis of accuracy and underlying intelligence has huge knock-on effects. Or to put it another way, I wouldn't call this model twice as useful as Nano Banana, but maybe four times as useful. As you'd expect, I'm going to re-emphasize that there are limits to the number of layers, how meta the model can go. I asked it to create an image where there would be eight different layers, where we see through eight different pieces of technology. In my head, I envisioned a 1950s black and white TV, on which we can see a color TV, on which we can see, et cetera, et cetera, all the way up to a VR headset for example. It got the idea, but there's not quite eight layers. Give that same prompt to a talented human artist and the result from the human would be unbelievably better, I would imagine. Okay, this next one is a bonus one. It doesn't count in the 10 I think I came up with, but the model doesn't suffer from the glazing effects that Grok apparently does. You may have seen some recent threads where people ask Grok about the CEO behind xAI, and it compliments him massively. Give Nano Banana Pro the prompt, Draw a podium with the best three AI companies, no context on what best means here, but one in each position on the podium, the winner being handed a trophy saying AGI. It clearly picks Sam Altman as the winning CEO. With its CEO, although technically I think the CEO of Google DeepMind is Demis Hassabis, and it does kind of look like a mix between Pichai and Hassabis, but that aside, Google's CEO is second. Anthropic and Dario Amodei are apparently in third. This all might have been true in 2024, but as we end 2025, I don't know. It might not be reflected in consumer numbers just yet, but it's looking an awfully lot like to me, Google being in the lead. Next, I would, of course, count the ability to place multiple characters into an image with character consistency as one of the features on this list. But the thing is, that is the very first thing that Google trumpeted. So I want to mention it, but focus more on certain details you might have missed. Just quickly before I do, I will note that I did test this feature, and the results, as you'd expect, are incredible. I just love noodles, and Nano Banana Pro was able to take two of them and place them outside this manner. That's my own photo, by the way, although not my own house. On text to image benchmarks, for what they're worth, I think the proof is in the pudding, but on such benchmarks, clearly Gemini 3 Pro Image, the official name, is far ahead of the others. Those were my impressions, but I'd be curious to know if you think I'm overselling it or underselling it. Either way, I will leave you with this thought. Imagine an image generated by Nano Banana Pro and animated by VEO 4 potentially coming out by the end of this year. Let me know what you think. Thank you so much for watching to the end and have a wonderful day."

The Japanese say, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're going to assess what the nature of the problem is.\" And they sent fact-finding mission after fact-finding mission. This is just the most famous one, the Iwakura Mission. And they're studying not only Western military institutions, but a whole array of political, economic, legal, social, educational, the works to understand the basis for Western power. And they arrive in Europe at a really interesting time. It's when Otto Von Bismarck is just finishing up the Third War of the unification of the Germanic states. And the Japanese are thinking, \"Wow, this might be relevant to us because we're divided up into all these feudal domains.\" And the question is, can you modernize without having the Westernized institutions? They didn't particularly like Western culture, and the Japanese when they posed this question back in the day, they decided the answer was no. So, they get home, they set themselves a policy objective, which is to protect Japanese national security and sovereignty. And they come up with a two-phase grand strategy to do this. It's going to be, start with a domestic phase of Westernization. Westernize your institutions. When they're done with that, they're going to have a foreign policy phase, which is going to be about starting an empire. Why do that? Because they look at all the powers of their day and think, \"What's a great power look like in those days?\" Well, it has an empire. So, they go, \"Well, WATCH HERE, we're gonna have an empire.\" So the Japanese, unlike China, which fights war after war with these Westerners, trying to defeat them militarily, and it's unsuccessful. The Japanese say, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're going to assess what the nature of the problem is.\" And they sent fact-finding mission after fact-finding mission. This is just the most famous one, the Iwakura Mission. And they're studying not only Western military institutions, but a whole array of political, economic, legal, social, educational, the works to understand the basis for Western power. And they arrive in Europe at a really interesting time. It's when Otto Von Bismarck is just finishing up the Third War of the unification of the Germanic states. And the Japanese are thinking, \"Wow, this might be relevant to us because we're divided up into all these feudal domains.\" And the question is, can you modernize without having the Westernized institutions? They didn't particularly like Western culture, and the Japanese when they posed this question back in the day, they decided the answer was no. So, they get home, they set themselves a policy objective, which is to protect Japanese national security and sovereignty. And they come up with a two-phase grand strategy to do this. It's going to be, start with a domestic phase of Westernization. Westernize your institutions. When they're done with that, they're going to have a foreign policy phase, which is going to be about starting an empire. Why do that? Because they look at all the powers of their day and think, \"What's a great power look like in those days?\" Well, it has an empire. So, they go, \"Well, WATCH HERE, we're gonna have an empire.\""
