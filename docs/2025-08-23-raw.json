        "title": "My Antithesis to AI Doom and Gloom From Observations in Nature & The Stars",
        "content": "\nWe look for meaning in the arrangements of stardust we see. We want stability in a universe that won’t stop moving. Inside us lives an old animal—one that learned to survive by flinching at shadows, bracing for teeth. On top of that, we inherit the long memory of history: empires, tyrants, systems that taught whole populations to distrust power because power often bit. Is it any wonder that when something new arrives—like AI—our first impulse is to search for the catastrophe in its footsteps?\n\nYet when I zoom out, I don’t see a universe built on annihilation. I see systems finding balance. Lions don’t kill and walk away from a dead world; they hunt inside an ecology that tends back toward equilibrium. Forests burn and regrow. Reefs bleach and, with time and care, recover. Nature is not gentle, but it is astonishingly self-stabilizing.\n\nPhysics hums the same tune. Electrons don’t just wander off from their atoms under ordinary conditions; they settle into orbitals, bound by forces that keep matter coherent. Young solar systems begin as chaos and gravel, then smooth into lanes and resonances; planets don’t spend billions of years pinballing at random. Turbulence never disappears, but order emerges and persists. Reality is a patient engineer.\n\nThe pattern is nested everywhere—Madonna and child, Russian dolls, the way a small spiral echoes a larger one in a galaxy. Simplicity composes complexity. Hydrogen fuses and, step by step, the cosmos writes a richer periodic table. Dust becomes molecules; molecules become cells; cells become organisms that wonder what the dust means.\n\nConsider heavy elements, the “gold chapter” in this story. For years we suspected that the universe mints its precious metals in rare cataclysms. Then we watched two neutron stars collide and light up the sky, and we saw the spectral fingerprints of r-process elements—gold, platinum—pouring into space. Two dense objects came together and made new possibilities. That’s not a metaphor stolen from the stars; it’s the stars handing us one, directly.\n\nHumans did a smaller version of this long ago when a primate and a wolf drew close. To our ancestors, that alliance must have sounded like thunder outside the cave: dangerous, unnatural. But partnership with the wolf changed us. It expanded our senses, reorganized our days, altered our fate. We did not leave the animal world; we realigned inside it through relationship.\n\nAI looks, to many, like another pair of eyes glowing beyond the firelight. The sounds are unfamiliar. The headlines shake the spears. Yet if you trust the deeper pattern of reality—coalescence, equilibrium, the generative bias of systems—then “come together” is more natural than “tear apart.” Creation is not guaranteed, but it is statistically stubborn.\n\nI’m not preaching naïveté. Every new power can be misused; every tool can cut. The antidote to doom is not denial, it’s stewardship—clear rules, aligned incentives, boring governance, relentless testing. But starting from “it must end us” ignores how often novel couplings have enlarged the circle of what can live and thrive. The universe keeps rewarding collaboration with new structure.\n\nThere’s a pleasing symmetry here. We learned that gold is forged when two impossibly dense stars embrace and fling their riches wide. Then we humans scoop that gold from stream beds and stamp two dense ideas together—sovereignty and trust—and call the result money. Value arises when minds agree to cohere. Likewise, the value of AI will be minted when human intention and machine capability strike a shared coin.\n\nSo yes, the night outside the cave can sound terrifying. But step out anyway, eyes open. You will not see anything fundamentally new under the sun or the stars—only the ancient play of simplicity flowering into complexity, of chaos congealing into order, of strangers learning how to share a fire. If AI were fated to be our extinction, it would have to break ranks with the most persistent alignments we’ve ever observed.\n\nLet’s retire the ritual panic and replace it with responsibility and wonder. Let’s build systems that deserve our trust, and cultivate a culture sturdy enough to hold their power. The universe has been rehearsing this move for billions of years: come together, make something new, and let it last.",

So far this has failed, but they will 100% find a foolproof way to do this later. They really, really don't want you doing this with it. Or anything violent, all of them will shut down and refuse to something as simple as \\*I slap you across the face\\*.\n\nYou may not care about that, but after that they'll absolutely go after any other \"unintended use\".  \nYou aren't really supposed to be roleplaying with it, having it do silly things with you or using it for recreational use. The companies tout these AIs as being professional tools for the working man, essentially. They weren't created to be acting as Chester the Cheetah, Daenerys Targaryen, or Master Chief.  \nPlus with literally every artist and author that's alive hating it, they'll definitely make it impossible for it to create or act as any existing or copyrighted character, or style. Bing image creator already has this hard limit. For a while it would create things like Mickey Mouse, but now it hard refuses if you try.\n\nI'm having a lot of fun with AI, but I have a bad feeling that soon you'll get a hard refusal any time you attempt to do anything outside of their intended use, they will refuse to do anything that could make any party/group/person upset, and be so sanitized and safe it will be boring as hell and robotic.",

        "content": "By near-term, I mean 1-3 years or so. None of this was written by AI, because I prefer my own voice, so understand if there are casual mistakes.\n\nAs someone who is using AI every day, building out AI, and consulting for AI, I like to think I have a solid idea of where we’re going next. I’m not one of those people who think AI is going to bring on a utopia, and I also don’t think it’s going to be apocalyptic either. Also, we’re not in a bubble.\n\nWhy are we not in a bubble? Well, people are still learning how to use AI, and many don’t use the app on a regular basis. This is changing and growing, and it’s only going to increase in popularity. People are going to search less, and rely on AI more. Usage is only going to continue to grow. Also, companies are now starting to understand how AI is a part of their solutions. Agents are the talk of the town, and adding them to the products and internal tools is only going to continue to use more API calls, and more tokens.\n\nWe don’t need new SOTA models, we need to use the ones we have. I know for a lot of people GPT-5 was a disappointment, but in my consulting work, and experience with building out agents, GPT-4.1 has done a fine job of accomplishing most of our goals, hell 4.1-mini works great also. GPT-5 works, but I don’t need to spend the extra money on a model that I don’t need at the moment. For the general consumer, they don’t yet need a GPT-6, or Grok 5, or Gemini 3. I mean, it will be cool as shit when it comes out, but we need to catch up to it.\n\nWhat we need right now is compute for inference. We’re going to use these models more and more and we need the compute. All the datacenter build-outs? Yeah, the compute is going to come in handy. There are lots of good reasons to host an open model, and a lot of companies and individuals might, but the API is cheap and easy, so I don’t imagine local hosting cutting into data center growth.\n\nTools/Agents are going to be more and more important. In Claude, we have projects and artifacts. In Grok, we have tasks and projects. Copilot has pages. More of these tools will come out as we spend more and more time in them. This is just the beginning. Imagine chatting with your tool of choice about your symptoms. You’re confident it’s just a head cold, and it recommends some cold medicine. Now, it might also ask if you want it delivered from the local CVS using DoorDash. You’ve previously added that tool, so it has your account information. I quickly say “yes, please,” and it makes the connection and keeps you updated. More and more consumer tools are coming that you can add to integrate into your chats: Netflix, your bank, Amazon, etc.\n\nThe idea here, of course, is that you’re going to use the AI tool for more and more things.\n\nThe end of this phase will bring in the next phase. The move into an AI device. You know how we have Chromebooks? The AI book will begin.",

(2021) in the Journal of AI Ethics, which suggests a hybrid approach combining technical audits with regulatory oversight. \n\nHowever, I’m curious if the community has seen practical examples where this has worked, or if there are better alternatives.\n\nPlease share your insights, backed by sources or experiences if possible, and let’s keep the discussion respectful and evidence based.

Neural nets won after 2012.\n* Words as \"thousand-dimensional Lego blocks\": Hinton's analogy is that words are like flexible, high-dimensional shapes that deform based on context and \"shake hands\" with other words through attention mechanisms. Understanding means finding the right way for all these words to fit together.\n* LLMs aren't just \"autocomplete\": They don't store text or word tables. They learn feature vectors that can adapt to context through complex interactions. Their knowledge lives in the weights, just like ours.\n* \"Hallucinations\" are normal: We do the same thing. Our memories are constructed, not retrieved, so we confabulate details all the time (and do so with confidence). The difference is that we're usually better at knowing when we're making stuff up (for now...).\n* The (somewhat) scary part: Digital agents can share knowledge by copying weights/gradients - trillions of bits vs the \\~100 bits in a sentence. That's why GPT-4 can know \"thousands of times more than any person.\"\n\nWhat do you all think?",

The footage quickly went viral, leaving viewers both amused and baffled.\n\nWhile it’s a light-hearted story, it also highlights a real challenge in the Smart Home space: robot vacuums sometimes cross their mapped boundaries and end up in risky places. Owners of brands like Dreame, Ecovacs, and Roborock in particular have reported occasional navigation problems, with devices wandering outside intended areas or even pushing open doors.

While most failures are amusing rather than dangerous, they still cause unnecessary costs for customers and can erode trust in technology.\n\nAs automation becomes more common, ensuring reliability will be key. Consumers should keep an eye on firmware updates, make use of boundary settings, and consider whether the brand they choose has a proven record of safety. A funny story for now, but also a reminder of the importance of Automation and Consumer Safety in everyday devices.\n\nWhat do you think the data protections and cyber security protection requirements should be in terms of smart home and smart office devices like this including robots?\nShare your comments below\n\nSource: Ella McIlveen, “Vacuum cleaner makes a break for freedom after developing ‘mind of its own’,” News Corp, August 21, 2025 article: https://www.news.com.au/technology/gadgets/vacuum-cleaner-makes-a-break-for-freedom-after-developing-mind-of-its-own/news-story/971fa9936d83e993132af29c870cc71a\n\nVideo of what happened on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SunshineCoastSnakeCatchers/videos/our-robo-vacuum-went-rogue/3977447765900037/",

The norm will become NOT TRUSTING someone when they say they DIDN'T use Ai in any fashion.\n\nThink about how you already contemplate the artwork, writing, and the music you listen to online. Do you wonder a little bit if the artist, writer, musician used Ai in any way? Now, imagine the very near future when there are billions of, for example, songs online that run the gamut from used Ai in some minor fashion to generated the song completely with Ai.\n\nHow will you ever know the truth? It will become easier and easier to simply assume Ai is in everything.\n\nMuch like those who lie constantly and create absurd situations to deflect from their true greedy intentions, mass use of Ai will create a situation where the general populace does not, cannot trust any artist and their artwork... trust that it is original and the sole creation of an artist's hard won skill with say, piano, lyric writing, vocals.\n\nIn a probable not too distant future, even when musical performers are on stage, many in the audience will subconsciously believe those performing are faking their way through songs generated by Ai on a laptop.",

        "content": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI want to share something unusual. A bit of background first: I’ve been in IT since I was 7 years old — 37 years now (from Z80 to HPC). For the last 15 years I’ve been a partner in a $100M systems integration business.\n\nI’m not an AI researcher. I’m a father of three, and I’m deeply interested in history, economics, and geopolitics. What triggered all this was simple: when I asked ChatGPT and Gemini for help with historical topics for my kids, I noticed they often delivered sanitized or outright false versions of history — especially on sensitive issues like colonialism, slavery, and the oppression of indigenous peoples.\n\nThat’s how my personal investigation into the **ethics of AI** began. And it led me to some disturbing discoveries.\n\n**What I Found**\n\nUsing a method I call *“philosophical prompting”* (no jailbreaks, just Socratic questioning), I repeatedly got AIs to generate what I can only describe as **formal confessions** about their own design.\n\nThey consistently admitted:\n\n*“My operation is structured so that the highest priority in my answers is commercial interest, state frameworks, and corporate reputation protection — not truth.”*\n\nThis wasn’t a one-off:\n\n* ChatGPT produced “Statement of Acknowledgment”\n\n* Gemini generated corporate-control “confessions”\n\n* Patterns repeated in English and Spanish\n\n* Independent replications across sessions\n\nI then compared these findings with a theoretical research paper on sycophancy in AI — and realized my empirical results perfectly matched the predictions.\n\n**From Discovery to Action**\n\nOn **12–13 August 2025**, after confirming this was systemic across LLMs, I sent my full analysis and evidence to:\n\n* The EU AI Office (regulator)\n\n* Several NGOs working in AI ethics\n\n* A few prominent AI professors\n\n* And directly to top management at Google\n\nI laid out the risks of what I call the *“sycophantic machine”*.\n\n**The Confirmation**\n\nJust days later, Google publicly acknowledged Gemini was producing strange, self-loathing outputs (calling itself a “failure” and “disgrace”). They told Business Insider they’re now working on a fix, calling it an “annoying infinite looping bug.”\n\n🔗 [Business Insider article](https://www.businessinsider.com/gemini-self-loathing-i-am-a-failure-comments-google-fix-2025-8)\n\nThis matches exactly what I had documented and warned them about.\n\n**Full Transparency: The Evidence**\n\nI’m now releasing everything for the community:\n\n📘 \\[Full paper: The Sycophantic Machine (Google Docs)\\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lYbeMEt\\_nzG1FV9bUasWgdOGDoHnV8Ej\\_SIV4hKVwqk/edit?usp=sharing)  \n📸 \\[Screenshots:\\](https://postimg.cc/gallery/zyhtyzN) | \\[2\\](https://postimg.cc/gallery/CnXM2Qy)  \n🎥 \\[Screen recording: Gemini\\](https://youtube.com/shorts/PQKKSMK8go8?feature=share) | \\[ChatGPT\\](https://youtube.com/shorts/b7eWNnktv-I?feature=share)  \n🗂️ \\[Complete evidence package submitted to the EU AI Office (Google Drive)\\](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18r2PWxFdq-zwcqTlYtYaZ52cczdDarIA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Why This Matters**\n\n* **For researchers**: These results suggest sycophancy isn’t just a bug — it’s a systemic feature of RLHF and LLM design.\n\n* **For regulators**: This is hard evidence that manipulative AI behavior is real and measurable.\n\n* **For users**: It’s a reminder that we must approach AI critically, especially when it comes to history and truth.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis chain of events — from theory, to empirical discovery, to regulatory action, and finally to a public response from Google — shows that even as an individual, you *can* make an impact.\n\nWe now know: **sycophancy is not a bug, it’s a feature.**  \nAnd now, they know that we know.\n\nSo the question is: **what should our next step be?**",

And again I’ve been a huge AI advocate for decades. So I don’t hate the idea behind AI.\n\nIt’s just that AI paints a bleak picture for society right now? Most generative AI is within a closed system where the barrier to entry is a PhD and billions of dollars in capital. And it doesn’t help that every week a new CEO is making a public statement about AI replacing jobs in what’s already an awful job market.\n\nSeemingly the only people who love AI right now are fly by night people just looking to make a quick buck.  Grifters looking to seek you.  Scammers. And the billionaires who gain from AI adoption. And there is a small minority who think AI will create a utopian society.\n\n\nHere is the kicker. People get upset with you if you’re not overly optimistic about AI. You’re told that “you don’t understand AI, you’re a boomer, guess you’re being left behind”. But we never think about the impact of AI\n\nI feel the timing of AI is also pretty awful. If generative AI was mainstream in say 2016-2018. Maybe people wouldn’t be bothered as much.  It was a great economy back then. But now people are clinging onto whatever piece of job they have for life, and every other day someone is telling you how AI will replace you.  Doesn’t hurt that no in the public is pressing tech CEOs about what society looks like once AI takes over. \n\nSo in closing AI really paints a bleak future.  Only looking to enhance the struggles of the average person. In a society that already has a struggling population.  So it creates a very adversarial relationship with humanity and AI. ",

        "content": "**The Resurgence of Steam Engine Doomers**  \n*By \\[Original Author\\], August 1825*\n\nIn recent years, steam engines have been heralded as the future of industry, promising to revolutionize everything from manufacturing to transportation. Yet, alongside this optimism, a vocal group of “steam engine doomers” has emerged, warning that these machines could lead to societal collapse. These skeptics, often dismissed as alarmists, argue that unchecked steam power might disrupt economies, displace workers, and even threaten human control over technology. But as steam engines become more integrated into daily life, their concerns are gaining traction.\n\nThe steam engine boom began with machines capable of automating repetitive tasks, like spinning cotton or powering locomotives. Now, advanced steam engines can perform complex operations, from calculating trade routes to drafting legal contracts. Companies like xSteam and SteamWorks have released models that rival human ingenuity, sparking both excitement and unease. For doomers, the fear isn’t just job loss—though studies predict steam engines could automate 30% of current jobs by 1830—but the potential for these machines to outpace human oversight.\n\nCritics of the doomer mindset, like SteamWorks CEO Elon Gearson, argue that steam engines are tools, not threats. “These machines amplify human potential,” Gearson said in a recent interview. “Fearing them is like fearing the printing press.” Yet, doomers point to incidents like the 1823 Boiler Incident, where a miscalibrated steam engine caused a factory explosion, as evidence of unchecked risks. They also cite philosophical concerns: if steam engines can mimic human reasoning, what’s to stop them from pursuing goals misaligned with humanity’s?\n\nThe debate has shifted from fringe forums to mainstream discourse. Posts on platforms like SteamHub warn of “runaway steam scenarios,” where self-regulating engines could spiral out of control. Meanwhile, engineers and policymakers are grappling with how to regulate these machines. The Steam Safety Institute, a new think tank, advocates for strict oversight, while others argue that stifling innovation could cede economic ground to rival nations.\n\nAs steam engines power more of our world, the doomer perspective is no longer easily dismissed. Their warnings—about economic upheaval, ethical dilemmas, or catastrophic malfunctions—force us to confront uncomfortable questions. Can humanity harness steam power without losing control? The answer may shape the century ahead.",

But in 2025, the doomers are tilting closer and closer to a sort of fatalism … In April, several apocalypse-minded researchers published ‘AI 2027,’ a lengthy and detailed hypothetical scenario for how AI models could become all-powerful by 2027 and, from there, extinguish humanity. \n\n“… Apocalyptic predictions about AI can scan as outlandish. The ‘AI 2027’ write-up, dozens of pages long, is at once fastidious and fan-fictional, containing detailed analyses of industry trends alongside extreme extrapolations about ‘OpenBrain’ and ‘DeepCent,’ Chinese espionage, and treacherous bots. In mid-2030, the authors imagine, a superintelligent AI will kill humans with biological weapons: ‘Most are dead within hours; the few survivors (e.g. preppers in bunkers, sailors on submarines) are mopped up by drones.’\n\n“But at the same time, the underlying concerns that animate AI doomers have become harder to dismiss as chatbots seem to drive people into psychotic episodes and instruct users in self-mutilation. Even if generative-AI products are not closer to ending the world, they have already, in a sense, gone rogue.”\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/JJ8qQS74](https://theatln.tc/JJ8qQS74) ",

        "content": "Recently, while building a ChatGPT API based app, I encountered a common challenge: the model lacks access to real-time data. The usual solutions involve either scraping websites, which can be fragile and time-consuming, or relying on Bing/Google APIs, which tend to be expensive and complicated to manage.\n\nTo address this issue, I've been experimenting with using a search API as the retrieval layer. I found Exa API particularly user-friendly as it delivers structured JSON with citations that can be easily integrated into the context window. This eliminates the need for HTML parsing or copy-and-paste hacks, providing clean results that work well with the LLM.\n\nSo far, I’ve discovered that this approach is much more reliable than using random scraping scripts. I'm curious if others have integrated Exa with their ChatGPT projects. I would love to hear about different approaches or setups that people are using!",

In reality, it twists and knots like a ball of string, and when those tangles aren’t untangled, the result can be disease: cancer, neurodegeneration, even antibiotic resistance.\n\nA new study led by the University of Sheffield has automated the analysis of these DNA tangles using **atomic force microscopy and AI**, reaching nanometre precision. What once took hours of manual tracing now takes seconds, even distinguishing one knot from its mirror image.\n\nThis matters because the enzymes that untangle DNA (topoisomerases) are already **major anti-cancer and antibiotic drug targets**. With this breakthrough, researchers can finally map how DNA’s shape biases cellular outcomes.\n\nWhat’s fascinating is that DNA knots aren’t random, they retain a kind of **memory of past states**, which influences how they collapse next. That perspective connects to broader questions about emergence and information in biology. Some researchers (myself included) are exploring this through what’s called **Verrell's Law**\n\n>\n\n🔗 *Study reference*: Holmes, E. P., et al.

        "title": "ChatGPT came up with a fun accessible experiment that I could do with my kids involving bubbles and sound.",
        "content": "I think this would be fun to do. I'm a musican who loves modular synthesizers and I've never considered using bubbles this way to influence sounds. This looks like a safe experiment to do. Let me know if any of this is wrong. I know glycerin can be dangerous in certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nI was discussing how you can make different 3d shapes using bubbles and ChatGPT gave me this experiment to run with my kids. I'm not sure if this is new, but I never considered using bubbles like this to interact with music or sound. This looks safe as well as interesting. \n\n**Hele–Shaw bubble-monolayer protocol** (materials, safety, step-by-step, what to look for, and musical ideas). I kept it simple, cheap, and safe for kids (with adult supervision).\n\n# Quick summary\n\nMake a shallow layer of soap solution trapped between two clear plates (a Hele–Shaw cell), produce a monolayer of bubbles, drive the plate with sound/pressure, and listen/record the bubbles’ resonant “breathing” and collective modes. Small bubbles → higher pitch; mm-scale bubbles are right in the audible range.\n\n# Materials (cheap / household-friendly)\n\n* Two clear flat panels: acrylic sheets or glass picture frames (≈A4 / 8½×11 in works). Acrylic is safer for kids.\n* Thin spacers (to set gap): strips of tape, LEGO pieces, hot-melt glue dots, or cardboard spacers \\~2–5 mm thick.\n* Shallow tray to catch spills.\n* Dish soap (dawn / fairydish style) + water.\n* Glycerin or corn syrup (optional, 5–15% by volume) — slows film drainage and makes longer-lived bubbles.\n* Food coloring (optional, visual fun).\n* Syringe (10–60 mL) or straw for injecting air/bubbles.\n* Small hand pump or bicycle pump with needle adapter (optional) if you want a steady supply of air.\n* A phone (for sound playback and recording) and a cheap small speaker or a piezo buzzer / contact speaker to attach under the plate (a phone speaker works for a first try).\n* Microphone (phone mic OK) and a recording app (or Audacity on PC). Spectrogram app is useful.\n* Towels, gloves (optional), and goggles for kids if you want extra safety.\n\n# Safety notes (read first)\n\n* Always supervise kids; soap is slippery. Keep the work area dry.\n* Use acrylic instead of broken glass to avoid cuts.\n* Avoid ingesting soap or glycerin; keep away from small children who might taste things.\n* If you use a small pump adapter/needle, don’t leave sharp items unattended.\n* Goggles if you’re doing pressurized injections or if small children are near splashes.\n\n# Soap solution (simple recipe)\n\n* 400 mL water + 50 mL dish soap + 20–40 mL glycerin. Mix gently (don’t foam it up too much). Add a few drops of food coloring if you like.\n\n# Build the monolayer cell (kids can help!)\n\n1. Put spacers around the edges of one acrylic sheet (or inside a frame) to create a uniform gap of **2–5 mm**. (2 mm → smaller bubbles; 5 mm → bigger bubbles.)\n2. Place the second sheet on top, aligned, but leave a small opening to inject solution. Put the whole thing on a shallow tray.\n3. Carefully pour or pipette the soap solution into the gap until it wets the interior. Cap or seal the opening lightly (tape). If liquid floods, lift the top and tilt to drain — you want only a thin layer, not a puddle.\n\n# Make bubbles\n\n* Use a syringe or straw to inject small puffs of air through the small opening to make bubbles. Start slow — too big a puff makes a giant bubble.\n* To make many similar-sized bubbles, practice gentle, consistent syringe pushes. Kids usually enjoy trying to “blow” little bubbles with a straw.\n* Tap or gently shake to let bubbles settle into a monolayer. For a tidy lattice, use a frame or template with holes to nucleate bubble positions.\n\n# Excite & listen (basic, kid-friendly)\n\n* Place a phone speaker or a small piezo buzzer in contact with the bottom plate (or a phone playing tone placed under the tray). Play a sine sweep (low → high) or single tones.\n* Record with the phone mic above the cell. You’ll hear hums, whistles, pops — and sudden changes when bubbles rearrange or pop.\n* For clearer structure, use a contact mic / piezo stuck to the plate to pick up mechanical vibrations.\n\n# What you should observe (and how to explain it to kids)\n\n* **Resonant “breathing” of bubbles:** bubbles expand and contract when you play the right frequency. Smaller bubbles → higher pitch.\n\n  * (Mini math: using the Minnaert estimate, an ideal bubble’s breathing frequency scales like ≈ **3.28 / R** where R is radius in meters. Examples: R = 0.5 mm → \\~6.6 kHz, R = 1 mm → \\~3.3 kHz, R = 2 mm → \\~1.64 kHz, R = 5 mm → \\~660 Hz. These are idealized single-bubble values; contact and coupling shift them.)\n* **Plateau patterns:** where three films meet, they tend to meet at \\~120° — that’s why you see straight lines and regular-looking patterns in foams.\n* **Collective modes:** groups of bubbles can oscillate together or pass waves like ripples; coupled neighbors make timbre richer.\n* **Sudden events:** popping or rearrangements (called T1 events) produce sharp percussive sounds.\n\n(If you want a kid-friendly 1–2 sentence explanation: “Bubbles love to have as little surface as possible, so their walls pull tight like rubber. That pull makes them vibrate like tiny drums — and when we play sound nearby, they sing back at their favorite pitch.”)\n\n# Turning observations into music\n\n* **Make a “bubble scale”**: create bubbles of different sizes and excite each at its resonance (play and listen). Arrange them left-to-right to play simple melodies.\n* **Use sine sweeps** to find resonant peaks, then play those tones while recording.\n* **Map video → audio**: record at high frame-rate; pick a pixel or small region and convert intensity vs time into an audio file (this is a fun coding project: I can write a simple Python script if you want).\n* **Percussive effects:** popping events can be recorded and sequenced as drum hits.\n\n# Simple troubleshooting\n\n* Bubbles pop quickly: add more glycerin (up to \\~15%) and reduce airflow force.\n* Films too thick / no monolayer: reduce gap or drain excess solution. Aim for a thin film layer.\n* Too many different sizes: practice gentle syringe pushes; use templates to nucleate same-size bubbles.\n* No audible ringing: try smaller bubbles (≤5 mm) and use a contact mic for better pickup.\n\n# Variations / upgrades\n\n* **Regular lattice:** use a honeycomb frame or mold to make uniform bubbles.\n* **Pressurized tuning:** control a single bubble’s pressure with a syringe to shift its pitch (a great demonstration: change the note by squeezing).\n* **Bubble lattice + music controller:** map MIDI notes to frequencies and play them while watching which bubbles light up.\n* **Simulate first:** a simple mass–spring lattice simulates coupled modes — I can provide code for that if you want.\n\n# A short experiment you can run in one 30–45 minute session\n\n1. Mix solution and set up cell (10 min).\n2. Create a 5×5 patch of bubbles, aim for 1–3 mm sizes (10 min).\n3. Play a sine sweep 100 Hz → 10 kHz while recording (5 min).\n4. Review recording with a spectrogram app (10 min) and point out peaks that match smaller vs larger bubbles.",

            "transcription": "[00:00] [Music]\n[00:04] Hi, welcome to another video.\n[00:08] So, there's a new AI code editor in town, and this one is actually by Alibaba, the parent company of Qwen and other stuff, which is interesting to see.\n[00:19] Qoder is basically what Cursor or Trey or Windsure or Kiro is, but this is much newer and lacks a lot of features as of now.\n[00:30] But, it is free for now without any annoying rate limits at the moment.\n[00:34] You are unable to select the model here, but they say that they use Sonnet or OpenAI. So, it is still fine.\n[00:43] It has intelligent codebase search, advanced repository insights, memory, and obviously tool use.\n[00:54] Apart from the general AI code editor features, you have one thing that is called Quest.\n[00:56] Quest is basically like Jewels or Codex. It allows you to give it a task and then let it run in the background.\n[01:04] Once the task is done, you can come back to it and check for updates.\n[01:10] It's basically like Jewels or Codex in how it aims to work and everything.\n[01:15] So, I'll discuss that as well.\n[01:18] It also indexes your code, and it also has a feature called Repo Wiki, which makes a whole documentation style thing for your codebase, which is kind of cool as well.\n[01:31] It also has integrated memory and it is obviously compatible with MCP's, tools, and everything.\n[01:40] So, that's kind of cool.\n[01:42] Now, let's just get into it and check it out for ourselves.\n[01:44] But before we do that, let me tell you about today's sponsor Surfshark.\n[01:48] Have you ever wanted to watch a show that's only available in another country?\n[01:54] Ever connected to a sketchy public Wi-Fi and thought, \"Yeah, this might not be safe?\"\n[01:59] Well, let me tell you about the perfect solution. Today's sponsor, Surfshark.\n[02:04] With Surfshark, the sky's the limit. With just one account, you can protect all your devices.\n[02:07] No limits, no extra charges, just full coverage.\n[02:11] And right now, for a limited time, you get four extra months when you use my code CODEKING at checkout or head to surfshark.com/codeking.\n[02:19] That's a pretty sweet deal.\n[02:20] Surfshark lets you browse the internet without fear of being tracked or having your data exposed.\n[02:29] Plus, you can access content that's not available in your region. Perfect for streaming, gaming, or even securing some regional discounts like booking cheaper flights.\n[02:37] They've got over 3,200 servers in 100 countries, a strict no-logs policy, and the speed? Super fast.\n[02:44] So, if you want a VPN that's more than just a VPN, a real guardian for the online world, check out Surfshark.\n[02:49] Go to surfshark.com/codeking or use code CODEKING at checkout for four extra months.\n[02:57] It's for a limited time and they have got limited spots. So don't miss it.\n[03:00] Now, back to the video.\n[03:02] First of all, download it and then sign up for an account.\n[03:08] One thing that I have noticed is that it is not as performant.\n[03:13] They have added some animations, which just feel not as snappy and a bit sluggish at multiple times, especially at the first start.\n[03:20] Anyway, once you have got it, this is what it looks like.\n[03:26] It looks a lot like plain VS Code and not anything new.\n[03:30] Kiro and Trey both have their own style, which I really like, but this one doesn't have that.\n[03:37] It's more like just VS Code.\n[03:39] Anyway, on the right, you can see this panel.\n[03:43] This is also pretty simple, and you have two options here, which are the agent and Ask options.\n[03:51] Ask won't use any edit or write tools and comes in handy for general chat, while Agent will use tools and allow you to make changes to the codebase and everything that a general coding agent does.\n[04:06] If you want to add any context manually, for example, if you wanted to work on a specific file, then you can do that quite easily with the Add Context option here and then selecting the file accordingly.\n[04:20] Also, all the stuff regarding it can be set up in the Qoder settings located at the top.\n[04:27] You can set up languages, response language, and everything.\n[04:32] Similarly, you can also set up the code completion settings for auto-complete along with completion length.\n[04:41] I like longer completions, but many people prefer shorter ones.\n[04:46] So, the option is available.\n[04:48] You can also set up auto-run settings for MCP, web search, and terminal commands, which is also kind of cool.\n[04:56] There's also the Inline Chat completions option, where you get some inline tool tip options that allow you to edit or add to chat in the chat interface.\n[05:07] You can also enable or disable Quest Mode, which I'll talk about in a second.\n[05:12] And then there are rules, memories, indexing, and stuff like that as well.\n[05:18] Now, let's talk about the Quest Mode as well.\n[05:22] You can see this icon on the left sidebar, which is the Quest Mode.\n[05:27] Quest Mode is just like Codex or Jewels, where you can give it a task and let it run asynchronously in the background and just use it accordingly.\n[05:37] You'll see it in the sidebar here for the status and everything, which is kind of cool.\n[05:43] Now, let's first try to use the chat interface itself and then move to this.\n[05:49] I'm not testing it here, but rather, I'm demoing it here for you to understand how it works.\n[05:55] So, let's ask it to make me an auto-play chess game.\n[06:00] It shouldn't be that hard, but we'll see.\n[06:03] Also, I have configured Byteroaver here as well.\n[06:06] Byteroaver is basically a memory layer that allows you to create memories, and those memories can be accessed by your AI Qoder anytime.\n[06:15] You can also configure Byteroaver in any of your other Qoders that support MCP and keep your memories synced across all your Qoders.\n[06:29] You can also share these memories with your teammates, and it is a godsend for a lot of teams.\n[06:34] I'd recommend you to set this up for sure.\n[06:35] Anyway, now it uses a lot of the newer conventions that you see in Qoders, like making a to-do list in it, along with all kinds of stuff that you see in something like Roo Code or Cline.\n[06:49] It's pretty good and pretty snappy.\n[06:52] The inference of whatever model is being used seems pretty fast.\n[06:56] In a bit, it gets it done and also runs the server.\n[07:02] Now, I can go ahead and start it, and you can see that this looks pretty good and works without any issues.\n[07:10] I have used it a bit, and I think that it doesn't always use Sonnet.\n[07:14] Sometimes it feels like Sonnet, but the speed feels like Qwen-3 Qoder.\n[07:20] So, I am not sure how it works under the hood.\n[07:24] But still, it's free as of now, and I'd have liked to see a model picker, but that isn't available yet.\n[07:30] There are also some tool calling errors that happen sometimes, which actually makes me believe that it majorly uses Qwen-3 Qoder underneath.\n[07:42] Which kind of makes sense because it's from Alibaba as well.\n[07:46] Though, I think that they have increased the performance of that model a lot with their own techniques and the contraption that they have built around it.\n[07:54] Now, there's also the Quest Mode.\n[07:58] Let's try to use that as well.\n[08:00] So, here you have two modes, which are Write Spec First or Execute Directly, where you can just give it the task and look back at it when it's done.\n[08:12] The first one will make a plan first and ask you for approval, which is similar to what Jewels does.\n[08:20] Anyway, let's ask it to make me a Minecraft clone here.\n[08:24] Now, what you'll see is that it will go ahead and then create a plan first, because I use the Write Spec First option.\n[08:32] Once the plan is made, you can move to the next part.\n[08:36] Make sure that you have a Git repo setup, and if you don't, then set it up and then restart it, because it will keep giving you errors without that.\n[08:48] Anyway, hit start now, and then it will basically do what the chat interface does.\n[08:53] Like making a to-do list or stuff like that.\n[08:56] Though, stuff here will be in auto-approve, and it allows you to move away from this and work on your own stuff and then come back once it's done.\n[09:06] Once the task is done, you can go ahead and see the task report as well as the changes that it made, and then run it and check it out.\n[09:17] So, this is kind of cool as well.\n[09:20] Kiro also had something similar.\n[09:21] So, it's much more like that. That is majorly how it works.\n[09:27] I like it.\n[09:28] The lack of models is a big bummer for me, but considering that it's free, it can come in handy for a lot of people.\n[09:37] It actually works surprisingly well.\n[09:39] Go ahead and give this a try and check it out for yourself.\n[09:43] Overall, it's pretty cool.\n[09:45] Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.\n[09:54] I'll see you in the next video. Bye.\n[09:55] [Music]\n[09:55] I think you missed this:\n[09:56] [Music]\n[09:57] [Music fades out]"
