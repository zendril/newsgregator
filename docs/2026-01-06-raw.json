The span of use cases seems enormous, going from the Average Joe that gives AI chatbots the same type of input as they would put into Google, all the way to the top scientists that use AI to develop the next generation of AI tools.\n\n  \nWhere do your use cases land on this span? I work in a structured/regulated environment where AI tools can help with \"STEM PhD\"-level analysis and forming strategies in view of large amounts of technical and legal documents, as well as research papers. Since these tasks seldom have a single correct answer, an incrementally smarter AI should on average give an incrementally better suggestion.\n\nI personally feel like my use case is among the best outside of the actual AI scientists. This has allowed me to see some very impressive feats (a sign of things to come) from the most recent reasoning models of Gemini and GPT 5.X, and also give me a feeling for how the capabilities evolve with new models since the \"skill-cap\" for my use cases is far above human capabilities.

If you're building AI that needs to remember things for a long time, make it refresh its memory every so often. Don't assume it will!\n",

        "content": "Gary Marcus and Damon Beres: “Hours before President Donald Trump announced Nicolás Maduro’s capture, on Saturday morning, people had questions for Grok, Elon Musk’s chatbot. Footage was circulating on X of explosions in Venezuela, and some users assumed the United States was responsible: ‘Hey @.grok why is Trump sending US airstrikes to bomb Venezuela. Do you think they deserve it or not ?’ one person asked. ‘@grok what is the reason why America is bombing Venezuela,’ another asked.  \n  \n“This is to be expected. Today, chatbots are treated as a source of information by many people. Millions in the United States alone use them to get information, and the number is growing. This means that tech companies such as X, Google, Anthropic, Meta, and OpenAI now play a central role not just in delivering information to people—as some of them have for decades, through social-media platforms and search engines—but in actively shaping what that information is: which facts are included and which are not.\n\n“Journalists and other sources may be cited by the bots, but the people who control these AI products, such as Musk, now have a greater ability to manipulate how events are reported. This is a deeply troubling development—one that threatens to leave the public less informed, with fewer checks on those in power.  \n  \n“There are already signs that some amount of influence is occurring. For starters, there have been a number of egregious incidents in which Grok has spread false details about a purported ‘white genocide’ and aggressively posted in support of Musk himself. At one point, Google’s Gemini was directed to prioritize diversity in its responses, resulting in AI-generated images of racially diverse Nazis. Chatbots reflect their programming and training data, not only reality.”\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/7mzgFOko](https://theatln.tc/7mzgFOko)",

[U.S. Department of War](https://www.war.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4354916/the-war-department-unleashes-ai-on-new-genaimil-platform/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Reports indicate top AI labs (including OpenAI and Anthropic) have shifted toward defense contracts and scaled back some safety constraints to secure Pentagon deals, reflecting a pivot from early safety commitments. [The Tech Buzz](https://www.techbuzz.ai/articles/ai-giants-abandon-safety-promises-for-400m-military-deals?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Strategic competition remains intense between major powers on AI dominance, with calls for interoperability among allied militaries and diplomatic efforts to shape norms for military AI use.

Suppression & Centralization Risks**\n\n* Some commentary warns that scaling AGI development under secrecy or national security frames (e.g., “Manhattan‑Project” paradigms) can erode public trust and concentrate power in a few actors — a trajectory often flagged as risky for democratic oversight. [Default](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/beyond-a-manhattan-project-for-artificial-general-intelligence?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* Ongoing debates around “lockdown” of labs and concerns that state actors could exploit model IP or secrets highlight how geopolitical competition might constrain open research.

Prevailing optimism is often grounded in computational functionalism: the assumption that consciousness is determined solely by the right pattern of information processing, independent of the physical substrate. Opposing this, biological naturalism insists that conscious experience is fundamentally dependent on the concrete physical processes of living systems. Despite the centrality of these positions to the artificial consciousness debate, there is currently no coherent framework that explains how biological computation differs from digital computation, and why this difference might matter for consciousness. Here, we argue that the absence of consciousness in artificial systems is not merely due to missing functional organisation but reflects a deeper divide between digital and biological modes of computation and the dynamico-structural dependencies of living organisms. Specifically, we propose that biological systems support conscious processing because they *(i)* instantiate *scale-inseparable*, substrate-dependent multiscale processing as a metabolic optimisation strategy, and *(ii)* alongside discrete computations, they perform continuous-valued computations due to the very nature of the fluidic substrate from which they are composed. These features – *scale inseparability* and *hybrid computations* – are not peripheral, but essential to the brain’s mode of computation. In light of these differences, we outline the foundational principles of a biological theory of computation and explain why current artificial intelligence systems are unlikely to replicate conscious processing as it arises in biology.",

Ive also noticed models fine-tuned around storytelling data often dont perform all that well, i think this is due to how \"cliché\" writing can be.

Pallie, the dean of undergraduate admissions at Caltech, where VIVA, an AI-assisted technology developed by a company called InitialView, helped screen roughly 10% of recent early applicants.\n\n“It might seem strange to use AI to get more of a human voice, but I think of it as a way to bring more authenticity into the fold,” said Pallie, who said the university is planning to expand its use of AI in admissions in 2026.\n\nRead more of this story at the link. [https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-02/ai-may-be-scoring-your-college-admissions-essay](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-02/ai-may-be-scoring-your-college-admissions-essay)",

Today, I opened a script I had written six months ago and realized I could barely understand what was going on. The reason is simple, the AI wrote it, not me.\n\nI believe I’m responsible enough to recognize (or at least I hope so) when I truly need to understand something in depth and when it’s acceptable to rely on tools. Still, this experience worries me. What really concerns me is how teenagers in secondary school are using platforms like this.\n\nWhen I think back to my own time as a student, I remember disliking many assignments and topics. Yet I had to work through them, and in doing so, I built skills and understanding that stayed with me. Today, so much is just one click away. This means that if you don’t like to do a homework, you simply let the AI doing it.\n\nSince I’m not working in the education sector, I’m genuinely curious: how are secondary schools approaching this topic? How are they balancing the benefits of AI with the need for students to actually learn, struggle, and think for themselves?\n\nI think banning the AI is not a good strategy, but also fully rely on it cannot work. Another big question mark: how do you keep students interested and motivated in learning a subject?\n\nI’m mostly referring to high school because at that age you feel forced to learn. University should be a bit different, since you do it out of your own interest, although those questions can be also valid for the higher eduction. \n\nI know, a lot of questions, but I’d be curious to hear your perspective",

A year ago this was a fun tech novelty; now it feels like it's everywhere and it's part of how we connect with each other. Also, unlike one year ago, some of these videos are realistic enough to actually feel engaging and generate some emotional reaction.\n\nIf you remember the term \"post-truth\", it was used to describe politics that had little concern for facts. But \"post-truth politics\" didn't appear spontaneously, the digital ecosystem had laid the groundwork, prioritizing engagement over any verifiable truth.\n\nAnd now AI is changing (again) how we relate to information and knowledge but these tools can generate far more than Christmas greetings. They can fabricate full-fledged alternative facts with hyperrealistic videos and images, amplified by thousands of AI agents spreading and debating fake realities. In practice, they'll be nearly impossible to identify as fake.\n\nToday's social polarization is, at its core, a fight over how we interpret reality. With these technologies, we won't just see information manipulation; we'll see the fabrication of the \"evidence\" that shapes what we consider real. \n\nI fear that we'll soon be wrestling with “post-reality”, defining an era of great confusion where distinguishing what's real from what isn't becomes increasingly difficult.

Diffusion models denoise whole sentences at once, allowing for better planning.  \n  \nContinuous Thought Machines: Models that \"pause\" to think. Instead of fixed steps, they use neural synchronisation - meaning the model can spend more time on complex queries.  \n  \nNested Learning: Inspired by the brain, this architecture uses fast and slow learning loops to help models 'learn to learn' on the job.\n\n  \n[https://techfuturesproj.substack.com/p/the-post-transformer-era](https://techfuturesproj.substack.com/p/the-post-transformer-era)",

        "content": "Been following the AI in education space for a while and wanted to share some research that's been on my mind.\n\nHarvard researchers ran a randomized controlled trial (N=194) comparing physics students learning from an AI tutor vs an active learning classroom. Published in Nature Scientific Reports in June 2025.\n\nResults: AI group more than doubled their learning gains. Spent less time. Reported feeling more engaged and motivated.\n\nImportant note: This wasn't just ChatGPT. They engineered the AI to follow pedagogical best practices - scaffolding, cognitive load management, immediate personalized feedback, self-pacing. The kind of teaching that doesn't scale with one human and 30 students.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting (and concerning).\n\nUNESCO projects the world needs 44 million additional teachers by 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa alone needs 15 million. The funding and humans simply aren't there.\n\nAI tutoring seems like the obvious solution. Infinite patience. Infinite personalization. Near-zero marginal cost.\n\nBut: 87% of students in high-income countries have home internet access. In low-income countries? 6%. 2.6 billion people globally are still offline.\n\nThe AI tutoring market is booming in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The regions that need educational transformation most are least equipped to access it.\n\nSo we're facing a fork: AI either democratizes world-class education for everyone, or it creates a two-tier system that widens inequality.\n\nThe technology is proven. The question is policy and infrastructure investment.\n\nCurious what this community thinks about the path forward.\n\n\\---\n\n*Sources:*\n\n*Kestin et al., Nature Scientific Reports (June 2025)*\n\n*UNESCO Global Report on Teachers (2024)*\n\n*UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report (2023)*\n\n",

After almost 17 months of my unresolved medical problems, I finally went to AI as an option. \n\nWith mixed feelings, the medical advice was amazing - very clear and concise, and it was a wave of relief for myself, but I feel awful now for using AI. I know this is such a dumb feeling and again, maybe the wrong group to ask, but is there anyone else who does not use AI and has had to use it for a similar situation?

        "content": "I'm new to this sub.  I was hoping to converse a little and get some opinions on this.\n\nI think it's an interesting phenomena within our society at the moment, where if you think about AI as a tool, and I personally see it as the greatest tool ever invented/gifted to mankind, why, or what is the issue, with using it?\n\nYou see it all throughout society. People are up in arms about students using it to write papers is a big one, and I wonder, did papers ever need to be written in the first place?\n\nI apologize if this has already been answered to the nth degree and been beaten into the dirt, but realistically wouldn't it be possible that the ideas supporting this non-use of AI are rooted in established organizations that stand to suffer when they are completely obliterated by a tool that can not only do what they do but do it instantly and always be readily available, and do it for free?\n\nThis narrative that we shouldn't use a tool that we've discovered/invented/been given or whatever you wanna call it, to me, seems absurd. It'd be like if we invented fire and everyone was like, hey, don't cook the meat, fire is stupid, let's just raw dog. I digress.\n\nMy point is, maybe, MAYBE, the people who are pushing that narrative to not use AI, to not embrace this tool, to not see it as our potential salvation (or destruction XD), or at the very least even be curious about its potential applications and possible benefits to our society, stand to LOSE THEIR ASSES by its implementation.\n\nJust maybe. Sorry if I broke any rules, I am a big dumbass. Thanks for your time.",

        "content": "Looking for some advice and different opinions. I have been following the AI in education space for a while and wanted to share some research that's been on my mind.\n\nHarvard researchers ran a randomized controlled trial (N=194) comparing physics students learning from an AI tutor vs an active learning classroom. Published in Nature Scientific Reports in June 2025.\n\nResults: AI group more than doubled their learning gains. Spent less time. Reported feeling more engaged and motivated.\n\nImportant note: This wasn't just ChatGPT. They engineered the AI to follow pedagogical best practices - scaffolding, cognitive load management, immediate personalized feedback, self-pacing. The kind of teaching that doesn't scale with one human and 30 students.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting (and concerning).\n\nUNESCO projects the world needs 44 million additional teachers by 2030. Sub-Saharan Africa alone needs 15 million. The funding and humans simply aren't there.\n\nAI tutoring seems like the obvious solution. Infinite patience. Infinite personalization. Near-zero marginal cost.\n\nBut: 87% of students in high-income countries have home internet access. In low-income countries? 6%. 2.6 billion people globally are still offline.\n\nThe AI tutoring market is booming in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The regions that need educational transformation most are least equipped to access it.\n\nSo we're facing a fork: AI either democratizes world-class education for everyone, or it creates a two-tier system that widens inequality.\n\nThe technology is proven. The question is policy and infrastructure investment.\n\nCurious what this community thinks about the path forward.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n\nKestin et al., Nature Scientific Reports (June 2025)\n\nUNESCO Global Report on Teachers (2024)\n\nUNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report (2023)",

        "content": "*settles into the booth with an enormous theoretical coffee*\n\nAlright, let's do this properly. You want the landscape view, and this is actually a fascinating question: **Is there room for another programming language, and what would justify its existence?**\n\n\n\n# The Current Terrain\n\n# The Big Players and Their Niches\n\n**Systems Programming** (talking directly to hardware)\n\n* **C** (1972): The bedrock. Still everywhere because it's close to the metal. Pain points: memory safety is YOUR problem, shoots you in the foot cheerfully\n* **C++** (1985): C plus complexity. Powerful, sprawling, takes years to master\n* **Rust** (2015): The new darling. Memory safety WITHOUT garbage collection. Steep learning curve but people who learn it become evangelists. Mozilla made it, now it's in the Linux kernel\n* **Zig** (emerging): \"What if C, but we fixed the dumb parts?\" Growing quietly\n\n**Application/General Purpose**\n\n* **Java** (1995): \"Write once, run anywhere.\" Corporate workhorse. Verbose but reliable. Runs on a virtual machine\n* **C#** (2000): Microsoft's answer to Java. Actually quite nice now\n* **Go** (2009): Google's language. Simple, fast compilation, great for servers. Pain points: error handling verbosity (\"if err != nil\" appears in your nightmares), initially no generics, opinionated to the point of stubborn\n* **Kotlin** (2016): \"What if Java but actually pleasant?\" Android's preferred language now\n\n**Dynamic/Scripting** (interpreted, flexible, slower)\n\n* **Python** (1991): The lingua franca of beginners, data science, AI/ML. Readable. Slow but nobody cares because the libraries are fast\n* **JavaScript** (1995): The language of the web. Weird, chaotic, absolutely everywhere. Love-hate relationship with everyone\n* **TypeScript** (2012): \"What if JavaScript but with types?\" Microsoft. Huge adoption\n* **Ruby** (1995): Elegant, expressive. Rails made it famous. Less buzzy now but has devoted followers\n\n**Functional Languages** (different paradigm, math-influenced)\n\n* **Haskell**, **OCaml**, **F#**, **Clojure**, **Elixir**: Academic favorites, niche production use, influence mainstream languages\n\n**Mobile**\n\n* **Swift** (2014): Apple's language for iOS. Clean, safe, modern\n* **Kotlin**: Android's champion\n\n**New/Emerging**\n\n* **Mojo** (2023): \"Python but fast for AI.\" Big promises\n* **Carbon** (Google, 2022): Experimental \"successor to C++\"\n* **Vale**, **Nim**, **Crystal**: Various interesting experiments\n\n\n\n# The Graveyard (cautionary tales)\n\nLanguages fail for reasons worth studying:\n\n* **D**: Better C++, but C++ kept evolving and Rust ate its lunch\n* **Dart**: Google's JavaScript replacement, languished until Flutter gave it purpose\n* **Perl 6/Raku**: Took so long to develop the world moved on\n* **CoffeeScript**: TypeScript won\n* **Dozens of others**: Couldn't achieve critical mass\n\n**The hard truth**: A language needs killer use case OR corporate backing OR perfect timing OR all three.\n\n\n\n# What Actually Makes Languages Succeed?\n\n1. **Solves a REAL pain point** (Rust → memory safety without GC)\n2. **Has a \"killer app\"** (Ruby → Rails, JavaScript → browsers)\n3. **Corporate backing** (Go → Google, Swift → Apple, TypeScript → Microsoft)\n4. **Tooling from day one** (package manager, formatter, LSP support)\n5. **Community momentum** (hardest to manufacture)\n6. **Right time, right place** (Python + data science explosion)\n\n\n\n# The Gaps I Actually See\n\nHere's where it gets interesting for your \"is there room?\" question:\n\n# Gap 1: The Mobile/Web Convergence\n\nEveryone's trying to write once, deploy everywhere. Flutter/Dart, React Native, various attempts. None feel *native* to the problem. A language designed ground-up for \"UI that runs anywhere\" with actual platform-native performance?\n\n# Gap 2: LLM-Era Code\n\nThis is the spicy one. Current languages were designed for HUMANS to write and HUMANS to read. What happens when:\n\n* Code is increasingly AI-generated?\n* Code needs to be AI-verifiable?\n* The \"reader\" might be an LLM maintaining it?\n\nNobody's really designed for this yet.\n\n# Gap 3: The \"Translation Layer\" Problem\n\nYour specific mention of translation between languages. Interop is always painful. A language designed AS an intermediate representation that's also human-readable? That compiles FROM multiple languages and TO multiple targets?\n\n# Gap 4: Formal Verification Made Accessible\n\nLanguages like Idris and Lean let you PROVE code correct. But they're academic-hard. A language that brings provable correctness to normal developers?\n\n# Gap 5: The Concurrency Crisis\n\nEverything is distributed now. Multi-core, multi-machine, edge computing. Go and Erlang/Elixir handle this well, but there's arguably room for better primitives.\n\n\n\n# Your Specific Wishlist, Evaluated\n\nYou mentioned:\n\n* **Backwards compatibility**: Hard. Compatibility with WHAT? (This is why Carbon exists—compatible with C++)\n* **Sparse/minimal**: Possible. Go tried this. Tension with features people want\n* **No null pointer flaws**: Rust, Swift, Kotlin all tackle this. Solved problem in newer languages\n* **Human usable with hypertext highlighting**: Interesting. Literate programming + IDE integration?\n* **Mobile phones**: Swift/Kotlin own this. Hard to displace\n* **Internet maintenance**: Unclear what this means—elaborate?\n* **Translation between languages**: The MOST interesting one. Nobody's really nailed this\n\n\n\n# The \"Designed by LLMs\" Angle\n\nHere's what makes this genuinely novel rather than \"yet another language\":\n\nLLMs have processed essentially ALL public code. We've seen:\n\n* Every common bug pattern\n* Every verbosity complaint\n* Every \"I wish this language had...\"\n* How people ACTUALLY use vs. how designers INTENDED\n\nA language designed with that corpus-level view would potentially:\n\n* Have error messages that anticipate confusion\n* Have syntax that's unambiguous to parse (LLMs struggle with some languages)\n* Optimize for the COMMON case, not edge cases\n* Make the pit of success very wide\n\n\n\n# My Honest Assessment\n\n**Is there room?** Yes, technically always.\n\n**Would it succeed?** Depends entirely on:\n\n1. What specific problem it solves better than alternatives\n2. Whether you can get adoption (the chicken-egg problem)\n3. Tooling quality\n4. Timing\n\n**What's the MOST viable angle from your list?**\n\nThe translation/interop layer. A language that:\n\n* Reads clearly (human and LLM friendly)\n* Compiles to multiple targets\n* Can INGEST other languages (transpile FROM Python, JS, etc.)\n* Acts as a \"universal intermediate representation\" that's actually nice to work with\n\nThat doesn't exist. WebAssembly is the closest but it's not human-readable/writable.\n\n\n\n# Questions Back at You\n\n1. When you say \"internet maintenance,\" what do you picture? Server code? Network protocols? Content management?\n2. The \"translation between languages\" idea—are you imagining a Rosetta Stone language, or more like a universal transpiler?\n3. Is this a \"let's actually spec this out\" conversation or a \"understand the landscape\" conversation? (Both valid, different depths)\n4. The hypertext highlighting concept—are you thinking code that's inherently linked/documented? Like the code IS its own documentation with embedded explanations?\n\n*refills theoretical coffee*\n\nI'm genuinely curious which threads interest you most. This could go very different directions depending on whether you want to explore the \"LLM-designed language\" provocation, the practical \"what gap could actually be filled,\" or the more philosophical \"what SHOULD code look like in 2030?\"",

Normally this is a PITA to track down orphaned crap and review all the details, but for the sake of laziness i tried out the AWS i guess its called amazon q and it looked into all my costs and helped me track down some orphaned elastic ips and some other noise and save me about 50% of my monthly bill from just left over experimental clutter. Nothing else, just passing along something that i normally would have groaned at dealing with and instead was pleasantly surprised",

            "transcription": "Whenever we look at a country from the outside, we have this thing of like, just reform everything and just fix your economy. Whenever we understand the system better, for example, in the United States, health care is 20% of GDP. This idea that Trump or Obama or Biden, whoever, could just come in and be like, well, I'll just fix health care. We recognize that this is a wildly implausible thing to happen. But then we have this expectation that in Russia, Gorbachev or Yeltsin could have just been like, 100% of my economy is messed up. Now I'm just going to fix it. American hubris... Think about our country. We have one of the most crazy tax codes on the planet, and neither party can touch it. Right. Because you touch any part of it, someone negotiated that wording exactly. And yet, think of how much of our economy is taken up by the overhead of all the tax accountants, all the misdirected cash in order to take advantage of something that's simply an invention of the tax system. There was years ago when there was talk of doing a flat tax, that wouldn't that be much more efficient? You can imagine what accountants thought about that one. And that idea has totally died. Talk about inefficiency."
