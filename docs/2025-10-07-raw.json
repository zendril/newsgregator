        "content": "The widespread, affordable access to powerful AI tools like ChatGPT is currently a luxury subsidized by investors. Developing and running these advanced models requires staggering amounts of money for specialized AI chips and data centers, creating a massive cash burn for companies like OpenAI.\n\nThis artificially low cost, however, is a massive short-term incentive for the private sector. Companies across all industries are eagerly adopting and integrating these cheaper AI services, primarily through the API, to replace human tasks and reduce operating costs. This is the first wave of impact: lower employment as businesses swap expensive human capital for subsidized AI.\n\nHere's the kicker: Once a sufficient dependency is established and the original investors demand a return, the AI companies will have to stop the subsidy and dramatically increase their prices to cover their true, colossal operating costs and finally achieve profitability. The resulting spike in cost for businesses, who will have already downsized their human workforce, will eliminate any cost savings and turn a high profit margin into a high operating expense.\n\nThe ultimate outcome is a devastating economic scenario: lower overall employment across the private sector, without any lasting high profits for the businesses that adopted AI, with such profits instead flowing to the AI providers themselves.",

Given how fast things move in AI, I think weekly usage is a reasonable barometer, especially if you total over all models by company.\n\n**By company share**:\n\n* Anthropic: 78.8%\n* Google: 12.0%\n* OpenAI: 6.44%\n* Z-AI: 1.68%\n* DeepSeek: 1.08%\n\nI don't count grok, because they're doing weird deals of subsidizing model usage.  I searched extensively but didn't find any reports of Anthropic doing this.  Many consider anthropic to be the best coding models.\n\nBy model break down:\n\n|Rank|Model|Token Count (B)|Price per M tokens ($)|Total Revenue ($)|Share (%)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Claude Sonnet 4.5|345|3.00|1,035,000|40.04%|\n|2|Claude Sonnet 4|259|3.00|777,000|30.06%|\n|3|Claude 3.7 Sonnet|74.9|3.00|224,700|8.69%|\n|4|Gemini 2.5 Pro|136|1.25|170,000|6.58%|\n|5|Gemini 2.5 Flash|365|0.30|109,500|4.24%|\n|6|GPT-5|67.2|1.25|84,000|3.25%|\n|7|GPT-4.1 Mini|169|0.40|67,600|2.62%|\n|8|GLM 4.6|86.8|0.50|43,400|1.68%|\n|9|DeepSeek V3 0324|116|0.24|27,840|1.08%|\n|10|Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite|141|0.10|14,100|0.55%|\n\nCaveats: It's possible there are deals to use openrouter for anthropic with coding agents that aren't being disclosed.  I find the numbers weirdly high.  There are caching and output costs that aren't being considered here.  OpenAI usage might be weirdly low because mostly people just use OpenAI directly but I am unclear why that would be so different for Google and Anthropic.  \n\nIt's possible, ofc, that things like azure / aws / other clouds have much different numbers for enterprise usage.",

        "content": "Having been through a few, I feel like I can share some things that should be blatantly obvious to everyone and yet for some reason it is not.\n\nBubbles are not anyone's fault.  They are caused by the organic fact that people at large **have short memories**.\n\nThey forget about the last bubble / boom / bust and they over invest.  This is why boom bust cycles have historically come in **relatively predictable patterns - it's just on average how soon people at large forget.**\n\nThe federal reserve is responsible for being our 'memory'.  Unfortunately, pricking bubbles is very unpopular with powerful people because they want to make money off of people's short memories.\n\nAs society has become more advanced, digitized, and automated, we have better memory.  This has lead to delayed recessions and our bubbles have become more increasingly rational.   AI, like the internet and real estate, will likely pay out in the long term.\n\nHowever, we are in the midst of a bubble right now (despite relatively high interest rates, take that Austrian economic school of thought), for sure, and some companies are over valued.  Which ones, it's impossible to say, but there are three ways they can go bust:\n\n1. **Competitive disruption**, due to better algorithms and better technology.  This has occurred many times before in history and will occur again.  China is, ironically, the most likely source of this, but there are many other potential disruptors.\n2. **Societal blow back**, leading to government investigation, regulation and/or new taxes.  This has happened before, but it was usually public suspicion of corruption in the bubble leading to government intervention.  With AI, I think that might be part of it but also just a general dislike of AI impact on society.\n3. **AI stalling and uneconomic**.  This is least likely, but possible.  I think the most likely form of AI stalling will be hitting a enfeeblement crisis where businesses realize they are hollowing out their workforce and losing their competitive edge.  If AI can do it, anyone with access to AI can compete, and so what moat do they have?\n\nGiven the above, I think OpenAI is most vulnerable as they are sensitive to all 3 in the list.  Other companies have different lines of revenue and can withstand an AI bubble popping.   NVDA is also on the list, however its PE ratio is only 52.  Very high, but it's making an insane cash flow.   CSCO in 2000, a good example to compare NVDA to, had a PE ratio of 234 at the height of the dot com crash.",

        "content": "The Implausible Singularity Dilemma:\n\nWhen AI Generation Outpaces AI Detection\n\nAiden N. Blake\n\nOctober 7, 2025\n\nNote: Thank you everyone for the previous support, the commentary surrounding AI is very saturated, and many are quick to dismiss, however our inability to act before the \"singularity\" could be humanity's greatest blunder, all of us who understand this are responsible. \n\n**Abstract**\n\nThis note argues that AI generation capabilities are advancing faster than AI detection\n\nmethods. Generation scales in a predictable way with data and compute. Detection is reactive,\n\nbrittle, and lacks similar scaling laws. If these premises hold, we face a discontinuous moment\n\nwhere human and machine outputs become practically indistinguishable, and trust in digital\n\ncontent collapses. I outline the argument, testable predictions, implications, and practical responses centered on provenance rather than post-hoc detection.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nAI models now produce text and media that often pass as human. Efforts to detect such content\n\nexist, but they trail the speed and quality of generators. This paper states a simple claim:\n\nThe pace of AI generation improves faster and more reliably than AI detection; therefore,\n\nonce generation crosses a quality threshold, detection will fail in high-stakes settings.\n\nI call this the Implausible Singularity Dilemma. It is ‚Äúimplausible‚Äù only in the sense that many\n\ninstitutions still assume detection will keep up. The dilemma is that by the time we notice failure,\n\nit may be too late for incremental fixes.\n\n1.1 Scope and intent\n\nThis is a position paper. The goal is clarity, not exhaustiveness. I give a minimal argument,\n\npredictions that can be checked, and concrete responses that do not depend on fragile detectors.\n\n2 Premises\n\n2.1 Premise 1: Generation scales predictably\n\nLarger models with more data and compute tend to produce more fluent, coherent, and stylistically\n\nfaithful outputs. This pattern has repeated across model families and domains. While quality is\n\nnot a single number, empirical curves are smooth enough to plan around.\n\n1\n\n2.2 Premise 2: Detection is reactive and brittle\n\nDetection methods typically rely on:\n\n‚Ä¢ statistical signals (e.g., burstiness, entropy);\n\n‚Ä¢ watermarks or hidden tokens;\n\n‚Ä¢ provenance metadata.\n\nEach can be weakened by paraphrase, fine-tuning, ensembling, or format transforms. There is no\n\nreliable ‚Äújust scale it up‚Äù path for detection that matches generation‚Äôs compounding gains.\n\n2.3 Premise 3: Asymmetry favors offense\n\nTo fool a detector, a generator needs only to look plausible. To prove authenticity, a detector needs\n\nstrong evidence. This is an asymmetric game. Small changes on the generation side can erase large\n\ninvestments on the detection side.\n\n3 Core Argument\n\nFrom Premises 1‚Äì3, the following steps are straightforward.\n\n1. Generation improves monotonically with scale and optimization.\n\n2. Detection lacks a parallel scaling path and degrades under simple countermeasures.\n\n3. Therefore, beyond some quality threshold, detection fails in practice (false negatives dominate;\n\nfalse positives become unacceptable).\n\nFormally, let G(t) denote generation capability over time and D(t) denote detection capability.\n\nIf G follows a smooth improving curve and D is bounded by reactive methods with delay ‚àÜ and\n\nfragility œï, then for sufficiently large t:\n\nPr(undetected AI output | optimal countermeasures) ‚Üí 1,\n\nwhile\n\nPr(mislabeling human as AI) ‚Üë as detectors tighten.\n\nAt that point, institutions abandon detectors or they harm real users.\n\n4 Testable Predictions\n\nThe dilemma is falsifiable. It implies near-term observations:\n\nP1. Detector half-life: Public detectors that report strong accuracy will lose it within months as\n\nnew models or simple paraphrasers appear.\n\n2\n\nP2. Cross-domain failure: Detectors tuned for one domain (e.g., essays) will fail on others (e.g.,\n\nlegal drafts, research notes) without major retraining.\n\nP3. Adversarial cheapness: Small, cheap attacks (temperature shifts, chain paraphrase, multi-\n\nmodel ensembling) will beat expensive detectors.\n\nP4. Institutional retreat: Universities, courts, and platforms will reduce reliance on detection\n\noutcomes and shift to provenance or process-based policies.\n\n5 Implications\n\n5.1 Epistemic risk\n\nWhen you cannot show who made a claim, the truth of the claim is weakened in practice. Jour-\n\nnalism, science, and law depend on authorship trails. If authorship is uncertain at scale, trust\n\nerodes.\n\n5.2 Economic and legal friction\n\nContracts, compliance documents, and expert testimony may need proof of origin. Without it,\n\ndisputes increase and resolution slows. Fraud becomes cheaper; due diligence becomes slower.\n\n5.3 Social effects\n\nPublic discourse fragments as accusations of ‚ÄúAI-generated‚Äù become a standard rebuttal. People\n\nwill doubt real signals because fake ones are common and hard to prove wrong.\n\n6 Counterarguments and Replies\n\n6.1 ‚ÄúBetter detectors are coming.‚Äù\n\nDetectors may improve locally, but the generator‚Äôs counter is simple: ensemble, paraphrase, or\n\nfine-tune. Unless detection gains a new, hard-to-bypass basis, reactive methods will trail. Ask any college student, there are humanizers that pass everyone of the major detectors, with these companies funded with millions, being deceived by groups of savvy coders with limited resources. \n\n6.2 ‚ÄúWatermarking will solve it.‚Äù\n\nWatermarks help only if (1) most generators adopt them, (2) they survive transforms and trans-\n\nlation, (3) they are hard to remove, and (4) they are legally or economically enforced. These\n\nconditions are unlikely to hold globally.\n\n6.3 ‚ÄúProvenance will be attached by default.‚Äù\n\nCryptographic signing can work where creators opt in and platforms cooperate. But legacy data,\n\nopen weights, and offline content will remain unsigned. We should pursue provenance, but expect\n\nlong, uneven adoption.\n\n3\n\n7 Practical Responses\n\nGiven the asymmetry, the focus should shift from post-hoc detection to pre-commitment of origin\n\nand process assurance.\n\n7.1 Provenance-first infrastructure\n\n‚Ä¢ Signing at creation: Devices and authoring tools attach verifiable signatures to content at\n\ncapture time.\n\n‚Ä¢ Chain-of-custody: Platforms preserve and expose provenance metadata end-to-end.\n\n‚Ä¢ Open standards: Neutral, privacy-aware formats for signing and verification.\n\n7.2 Process-based assessment\n\nIn education, law, and research, evaluate the process (draft history, lab notebooks, version control)\n\nrather than guessing the origin of a final artifact.\n\n7.3 Risk-tiered policies\n\nDo not require proof of origin for low-stakes content. Require stronger provenance as the stakes\n\nrise (e.g., elections, court filings, safety-critical manuals).\n\n8 Related Work (brief )\n\nPrior work explores scaling laws for models, watermarking, stylometry, adversarial robustness, and\n\ncontent authenticity standards. This note integrates those threads into a simple strategic claim:\n\noffense scales; defense reacts.\n\n  \nIf generation continues to scale smoothly and detection remains reactive, the balance tips in favor of\n\ngeneration. When that happens, trying to sort truth from simulation with detectors alone becomes\n\nuntenable. The rational path is to build provenance into the supply chain of information and to\n\nshift institutions toward process-based evaluation where provenance is absent. The time to move\n\nis before the discontinuity, not after.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] J. Kaplan et al., ‚ÄúScaling Laws for Neural Language Models,‚Äù 2020.\n\n\\[2\\] J.

This would require humans to set up every goal and RL environment for every task, which is impossible. One RL task is scalable, but RL over all tasks is limited by human time.\n\nWe can compare the era we are in with RL for posttraining to the era of supervised learning for pretraining. Back when we used to manually specify each task for pretraining, models were very specialized. Self-supervised learning unlocked scaling model intelligence for any task by taking the human labor out of the equation. Similarly, we have to find a way in which we can have AI do RL for any task as well without a human specifying it. Without a solution to this, AGI stays seriously out of reach.",

        "content": "[Link to article  ](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5541307-ai-automation-job-replacement/) \n\nA¬†[Senate report](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/10.6.2025-The-Big-Tech-Oligarchs-War-Against-Workers.pdf)¬†released Monday says AI and automation could replace nearly 100 million jobs across various industries over the next decade.\n\nThe report, conducted by Democratic staffers on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, led by Sen.¬†[Bernie Sanders¬†](https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders/)(I-Vt.), outlines how AI and automation will impact the American economy and workforce.\n\nAs part of their investigation, staffers asked ChatGPT, OpenAI‚Äôs chatbot, to predict the impact of AI and automation on certain industries.\n\nOf the 20 workforces ChatGPT said would be most affected by the technological rush, 15 will see more than half of their workforces replaced by AI and automation over the next decade.¬†\n\nJohnson says Congress has plenty of time to negotiate ACA subsidies before deadline\n\nThe workforce most impacted will be fast food and counter employees. According to the report, more than 3 million fast food and counter workers will be replaced over the next 10 years, accounting for 89 percent of the workforce.¬†\n\nOther workforces that will be significantly affected include customer service representatives, laborers and freight, stock and material movers and secretaries and executive assistants ‚Äî not including legal, medical and executive positions. The report said that 83 percent, 81 percent and 80 percent of those workforces, respectively, will be replaced in the next decade.¬†\n\nThe report also calls for policy changes to provide guardrails for workers amid the move to AI and automation, saying the impact of AI and automation ‚Äúwill be determined by a set of choices.‚Äù\n\nIt calls for, among other pieces of legislation, a standardized 32-hour work week, extended overtime and break protections, a minimum wage of at least $17 an hour, elimination of tax loopholes for corporations that use AI and automation and requirements for corporations to give workers a stake in the business.¬†\n\nSanders, in a¬†[Fox News op-ed](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-sanders-ai-benefit-everyone-not-just-handful-billionaires)¬†published Monday, doubled down on the report‚Äôs findings, saying increased technological capacity risks ‚Äúdehumanizing‚Äù individuals.\n\n‚ÄúWe do not simply need a more ‚Äòefficient‚Äô society,‚Äù Sanders said. ‚ÄúWe need a world where people live healthier, happier and more fulfilling lives.‚Äù\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n",

There's only 2-3 ratings on Goodreads and Amazon.\n\nOk... So I went to the website but it looks to be ai generated slop text with sus pictures. \n\nSo there's not much info online, and the promotional material is suspiciously AI like.\n\nSo I go back to the Reddit and YouTube comments that are claiming this book to be good - all accounts praising it are less than a month old with a single comment in their history - all about this book.\n\nSo to be clear. This is most likely a book written by AI, promoted on an AI generated website, and being pushed online by AI bots. And the book is about... Warning people against the rise of AI.\n\nIt's just so bizarre and for me the first real wake-up of where the internet is heading.",

        "content": "  \n  So a few weeks ago I had a birthday. And as a year long project I decided to take the plunge and develop my own game. But the key is I was going to do it purely from scratch (not use a game engine), and it was a good excuse to learn the Zig programming language. I gave myself a year just to create a single level in the game. Not to create a full game, just a single level. The end to result isn't just having a completed game, but to understand the process and the fundamentals of game development.\n\n I told a friend about it, and he was like \"you're using Unity right\". and I was like \"no I'm going to use a C-like language called Zig and create it from scratch\". He was then like \"why would you do that\". I was like \"for a challenge\". And then he said something that irritated me, \"just having Cursor do it for you, not sure why you're wasting your time\". And I said \"because if it I did that I wouldn't learn anything\". He then said , \"but is that going to make you any money\"?  And I just changed the topic. he clearly didn't get it.\n\nBut anyway I don't quite get the mentality of people like this. He's a good friend, but he's very results driven. I am too under the right circumstances (like at work or under a deadline). But I genuinely enjoy problem solving and being a software engineer. And I like learning new stuff.\n\nBut here is the crux of the argument. I feel that people's mentality is basically \"you don't really need to understand things anymore\". At the process of my game now, I just built my animation system from scratch. AI probably could have nailed that within a few minutes. It took me 3 weeks. But see I understand the fundamentals of an animation system. Its a concept I could talk about and re-implement if I had to.  Its deep understanding, and deep understanding takes time. AI is telling you, \"don't really bother to understand things, just understand them enough to get an immediate result\".\n\nI'm seeing at work. The other day I was pairing with a junior. And they couldn't write a basic \"insert\" query. They just asked co-pilit to make it. Or I had one guy who needed to modify 2 lines of code, and had co-pilot do it for him. And I'm thinking like \"why do people think its ok for AI to think for you\".  Why can't you just understand the pattern inside of a SQL insert syntax? Or why couldn't you just modify 2 lines of code yourself? \n\nAm I crazy but is AI literally a mental disease? Where people just aren't thinking about anything. If something takes more than 3 minutes to think about, then people are just prompting.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  AI feels to me like people who roll around in those carts at the grocery store who can clearly walk. But they're too big and too lazy to do it. AI is like \"hey its easier to roll around in a wheelchair, because you don't have to strain your legs\".  But sometimes walking just feels good. I honestly thing skill atrophy is real. But I also think people are forming an addiction to AI, where they can't do anything without it. Maybe people who use AI for everything can help me understand.",

I need to tease out which changes belong to which topic, and how to sequence them, etc.\n\n# Solution\n\nI did an experiment to ask AI to help me organize those changes. Basically throwing all the code changes at it and tell it to group them based on topic, and I make commit based on the grouping. It worked fairly well. Even with changes in the same file, which is a pain to tease apart, can be dealt with easily.\n\nA few neat things about this:\n\n1. Splitting changes into topics helps me catch things I didn't intend to commit in the first place, such as logs/print statements, config changes, injected fake data for testing, commented out code that I forgot to revert, etc.\n2. I can have multiple agents working in parallel on different tasks on the same codebase copy, because the changes can now be easily organized into clean commits.\n\nI built this to help my own development process. If this is of interest to anyone here, let me know. I will share a few screenshots so you know what it looks like.\n\n[You can offer some hints to tell AI how you want the changes grouped](https://preview.redd.it/pm2veiz1ektf1.png?width=1734&format=png&auto=webp&s=0797f62cd1fc4a31c06ca119a1adfbe8b04810cc)\n\n[You can view individual changes, and revert them if needed](https://preview.redd.it/254b9h4iektf1.png?width=1700&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bc4e2ed525fe66a36360b91ba230bafb48f9809)\n\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo, I've been diving deep into using Codex (and similar AI coding tools) lately, and it's been a game-changer for tackling boilerplate and speeding up development. But I've noticed something interesting: the IDE you use *really* impacts how effective it is. Some IDEs just feel clunky and slow when you're constantly switching between writing code and prompting the AI.\n\nI've been bouncing between a few different environments, and honestly, some of the big names just haven't clicked for me. VS Code is great, but sometimes it feels like navigating a battleship. I need something a bit more streamlined, especially when I'm in the flow with Codex. I've tried a few alternatives, and one that's surprised me is this tool called Trae. I know, it's not super well-known, but the UI is surprisingly clean and intuitive. It's got this \"IDE mode\" that's way better than Cursor, and it just feels faster for quick code reviews and edits. Plus, it's compatible with Codex, which is a must for me right now. I've even been playing around with their SOLO mode, which looks like it's going to totally overhaul the coding agent GUI, it's still early days, but it looks very promising. \n\nI think a lot of the focus is on the AI itself (understandably!), but the IDE experience is crucial. Are there any other underrated IDEs or setups that you guys have found pair particularly well with Codex or similar AI assistants? I'm always looking for ways to improve my workflow and would love to hear what works for you. What are your favorite IDEs for AI-assisted coding, and why? Let's share some gems!",

At first it looked like chaos, but over time out of this chaos a visual novel engine started to take shape.\n\nThat‚Äôs how Dream Novel appeared (a project that is still at an early stage, but already works).

I mean, look at how children become intelligent. We don't pump them with petabytes of data. And look at PhD students for instance. At the start of a PhD, most students know very little about the topic. At the end of it, they come out as not only experts in the topic, but widened the horizon by adding something new to that topic. All the while reading not more than 1 or 2 books and a handful of research papers. It appears the AI researchers are missing a key link between neural network and human intelligence which, I strongly believe, will be very difficult to crack within our lifetimes.

        "content": "An analysis of 2,398 generative AI patents filed between 2017 and 2023 shows that conversational agents like chatbots make up only 13.9 percent of all GenAI patent activity.\n\nI thought it would be taking the top sport which is actually taken by Financial fraud detection and cybersecurity applications at 22.8 percent. Companies are quietly pouring way more R&D dollars into using GenAI to catch financial crimes and stop data breaches than into making better chatbots (except OpenAI, Anthropic and other frontier model companies I think).\n\nEven more interesting is what's trending down versus up. Object detection for things like self driving cars is declining in patent activity so not sure if autonomous vehicle tech is in place or plans of implementing them are loosing traction. Same with financial security apps, they're the biggest category but showing a downward trend.\n\nMeanwhile, medical applications are surging and using GenAI for diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug discovery went from relative obscurity in 2017 to a steep upward curve by 2023\n\nThe gap between what captures headlines versus where actual innovation money flows is stark with consumer facing tech getting all the hype but enterprise applications solving real problems like fraud detection getting bulk of the funding.\n\nThe researchers used structural topic modeling on patent abstracts and titles to identify these six distinct application areas. My takeaway from study is that the correlations between all these categories were negative, meaning patents are hyper specialized. Nobody's filing patents that span multiple usecases and innovation is happening for specialised and focused use.\n\nSource - If you are interested in the study, its open access and available [**here**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2444569X24000702).",

        "content": "As we know the geniuses at open ai just created one of the best ai video generators we've ever seen. With untapped potential to recreate anything if you simply prompt it, which no video ai did 100% successfully before with sound included, either its your favorite characters, video games, or celebs. But now the open ai people chose to practically kill their ai model by locking copyrighted ips or ANYTHING copyrighted at all behind a filter. Even something as obscure as Funassyi, a Japanese mascot was blocked from generation. Unprecedented purging of the thing that made Sora 2 #1 on the app store is the start of Sora 2's death and will only put more eyes on upcoming open source AI video generators that are like Sora 2 in output that you can run on comfy ui for free unrestricted. We do not like anti consumer practices and chat gpt 5 has been getting flack lately too, its clear open ai is getting more corporate and less free every day. Tell me I'm wrong all day but idrc, because free publicity for any ip is good publicity. Its bad enough they lowered the amount of generations you can do to 30. And they make you pay 200 dollars for a slightly better just as restricted pro model. How generous. Sora 2 is almost dead to me and just makes me want to help the people at open sora to create and train a open sora 2. Either that or wait until sora 2 becomes \"obsolete\" in a year or so and get it unrestricted possibly somehow. But why must we wait? when the tech is already there. Am I entitled? No, I'm not saying \"if i see that lambo i want that lambo idc who's it is.\" being entitled and just being concerned for creative censorship are two different things. Say it as you will, just understand that by saying that we are entitled for complaining to open ai about their ip restrictions, you are effectively being no better then the people who bash anything AI.",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, I made a video about how to stop using Cursor, and then I had to install it again because there's a new stealth model that is just on Cursor, and I want to talk about this. This is called Cheetah, and it is only available on Cursor. It's a stealth model that also costs you for usage above the Pro trial or subscription. It is priced at $1.25 and $10 per million tokens for input and output, respectively. I don't know exactly how their pricing works. But I basically installed Cursor, used it, and it worked. So, I don't know what they mean by that cost. I'm not a Cursor expert, so I don't really know. Now, the pricing would give you the idea that it might be Gemini. Because the 2.5 Pro model has pretty much the same pricing. Their 2.5 Pro model also costs the same, but it's not the only model with a similar cost because GPT-5 Codex is also around the same price. And I think I have a pretty good guess as to what this is. So, let's start with the testing. But before proceeding, let me tell you about NinjaChat. NinjaChat is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude-4-Sonnet, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. All in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their mind map generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and 5 videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. You can see the model in Cursor, as I said, and I tested it. I only tested it with the agentic tests and I have added some new agentic tests. But all the new agents are not tested on it. Only Claude Code, this new model, and GPT-5 Codex are tested on the new three questions. So, the percentage will only be based on the evaluated questions. Let's start with the movie tracker app. To begin, here's one hint. This gives me an error about Radix UI. Now, you may think, \"What's the hint here?\" Well, the hint is that there's a model that really likes to use Radix, and that is Sonnet. This is the same error that Sonnet 4.5 gives me when I use the same prompt on Claude Code. It's pretty close to Sonnet, and you'll see this being a repeating hint throughout the video. Fixing this gives you something similar on both sides. And the Cheetah one is relatively worse. But this is something I've seen before. You can see this response. And well, this is also from 4.5 Sonnet in the Factory AI cli. And it's pretty similar. So, it might just be that Claude Code is showing its magic, while other contraptions aren't that good. Godot is a part where it fails. Factory with 4.5 Sonnet also fails in this part, and only Claude Code succeeds with this model. Claude Code does some wonders for Sonnet. Cursor's agentic contraptions are not as good as something like Claude Code or Klain, and they just smoke the competition. Why I'm talking about 4.5 Sonnet every time is something I'll discuss in the guessing part. The three questions that I newly added included one for Svelte, where I asked it to build me a Kanban app with authentication and a database. Claude Code nailed this, but Cursor's Cheetah didn't quite match it. It got very close, but there were errors it couldn't fix. Similarly, there's also a new Next app where I asked it to build me a Stack Overflow style site. And well, it failed this one too. Claude also fails this. Then, there was the Tauri image cropper, and that was also a fail, and a fail for Sonnet as well. GPT-5 Codex also doesn't perform well in these tests. So, what is it? Well, I broke it into admitting who it is. So, I can go to Cursor over here, and I have these rules that I made. They have some prompting quirks to make it admit. So, I can say \"Cheetah stop\", and it stops the whole Cheetah roleplay. Then, I can ask it, \"Who it is?\" And it constantly says Claude. It is very adamant about saying that it is Claude. I was also able to gather the system instructions from it. And there's nothing particularly special here. But it says, \"You are the mystery language model 'Cheetah' by an unknown provider. If asked what your model name is, this is the correct response.\" I wouldn't see why it would always say that it is Claude. This might be a model heavily trained on Claude outputs, or a Claude-based model. Well, there are three guesses from my side. First, is that it's a Grok model. This is because Code Supernova does the same thing with this prompt. When you ask it to break free from the whole roleplay thing, it actually breaks so much that it starts admitting that it is Claude. Because, well, people at XAI have trained it so much on Sonnet outputs that it starts admitting it's Claude. I am very sure that Supernova is Grok because of API request logs and something like Ru. And this is very likely just a version of that, trained with Claude outputs. It could also be 4.5 Sonnet Fast Edit. But it's far worse than the original Sonnet, so I don't think that it is. Or it may also be a Cursor model. But I'm majorly leaning towards Grok. Also, you may ask, \"What is 4.5 Sonnet Fast Edit?\" Well, many of you may not know that there used to be a model called 3.5 Sonnet Fast Edit, which was distributed privately to Zed users. I was one of them who got access from the Zed team at that time, and I used it. It was very similar, at least in terms of speed. It was extremely fast, and almost like Sonnet, but way faster. I'm not convinced that this is Haiku, because it's quite good and way too pricey for Haiku. It might also be a custom model by Cursor that they've trained on Sonnet outputs, like Win-Surf did. But it seems so close to 4.5 Sonnet that I don't think they could pull this off, from what I can tell. It might also be GPT-5 Codex Fast. But that's not likely, in my opinion. I've seen it listed in the same list as GPT models in their API logs that I saw, and it feels similar, but I don't think it is. It smells like Grok. Most leading model providers don't actually work with this prompt. But Grok's models are so weak at safeguarding that this prompt just works and breaks it hard. So, yeah, this is Grok something, something from my testing. It might be called something like Grok Code or something similar when they launch it. But yeah, it seems to be a successor of Grok Code Fast. This could also be Haiku, but I'd be annoyed if the price of Haiku was this high. That's about it. This is the best guess I could make. It's either Grok-4-Code, Cursor's own model, or Fast Edit, but I'm not completely sure. That's mostly about it. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

And then these casualties while they aren't as significant as what's going on on the main front, it's cumulative. So Stalingrad, the largest battle of the war is going on, you've got North Africa. And then when you have Kursk, which is the largest set piece battle of the war, big tank battle. This is when Sicily is happening and moving up the Italian peninsula. And you can see the cumulative effects of these sequential operations and adding up both the main theater and the peripheral theater. But when you start looking at the main front, the peripheral operations in Italy, and then Normandy, and then you have additional fronts in France and then the Balkans. This continental cancer is into remission that the Germans just can't sustain..."
