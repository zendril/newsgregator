        "title": "The Predictive Brain vs. The Transformer: Why Hallucinations are a Structural Necessity, Not a Bug.",
        "content": "\n\nHi@ll,\n\n\\----------------\n\nThe human cognitive system and contemporary language models are not archives of facts, but predictive–generative mechanisms whose fundamental goal is not fidelity of record, but operational economy: the minimization of energetic, computational, and social costs while maximizing adaptive utility. In this sense, “hallucination” does not constitute an implementation defect, but a structural byproduct of an architecture optimized for efficiency rather than absolute precision—consistent with the constructive account of memory articulated classically by Frederic C. Bartlett in *Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology* (1932) and neurocognitively extended by Daniel L. Schacter and colleagues in *The Future of Memory: Remembering, Imagining, and the Brain* (2012).\n\nThe evolutionary “algorithm” of the human mind was trained in an environment in which the cost of a false alarm was lower than the cost of missing a real threat. Heuristic perceptual hypersensitivity, favoring rapid and simplified judgments, became an adaptive advantage, even if it generated systematic cognitive distortions—a mechanism formally described by Martie G. Haselton and David M. Buss in *Error Management Theory: A New Perspective on Biases in Cross-Sex Mind Reading* (2000), and biologically generalized by Randolph M. Nesse in *The Smoke Detector Principle: Natural Selection and the Regulation of Defensive Responses* (2018). In parallel, the social priority—the need to maintain group cohesion and to legitimate one’s position within relational structures—shaped cognition as a narrative process, susceptible to conformity and the recontextualization of facts within dominant cultural schemas. The suggestibility of this reconstruction is empirically demonstrated by the studies of Elizabeth F. Loftus and John C. Palmer in *Reconstruction of Automobile Destruction* (1974), showing how the very phrasing of a question can modify subsequent “memories” of an event.\n\nAnalogously, language models do not operate on a collection of documents, but within a parameter space encoding statistical regularities of language and knowledge. An answer is not a retrieval from an archive, but a momentary reconstruction generated in response to the current query context. The architectural foundations of this mechanism are described in the work of Ashish Vaswani and colleagues, *Attention Is All You Need* (2017), and its scalability and capacity for context-sensitive knowledge generation in the study by Tom B. Brown et al., *Language Models are Few-Shot Learners* (2020). Computational economy enforces compression: instead of storing facts, the system stores patterns of their occurrence, enabling productivity at the expense of guarantees of source fidelity.\n\nIn both cases, the mechanism of “hallucination” follows from the same operational principle: gaps in the internal model are filled by the most coherent and probable inferences generated by the model itself. In humans, these take the form of reconstructive distortions modulated by current beliefs, social suggestions, and the need for narrative coherence; in AI systems, they appear as statistical confabulations arising from dominant linguistic patterns, prompt context, and ambiguities in training data, systematically classified in the review by Lei Huang and colleagues, *A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models* (2023). **In its extreme form, this same reconstructive–predictive process can lead to the production of internally coherent yet empirically ungrounded narratives—from “facts” generated by a language model to conspiracy theories circulating in the social sphere—whose persuasive force derives not from correspondence with reality, but from internal coherence and alignment with the expectations of the audience.** In both instances, the outcome does not take the form of a deliberate falsehood, but of the “best possible reconstruction” within the limits of the available representation.\n\nThus, the analogy between biological cognition and artificial generation ceases to concern merely superficial errors and instead reveals a shared ontology of operation: both systems are machines for prediction and synthesis rather than for reproduction. This cognitive paradigm finds formal grounding in the theory of predictive coding and the free-energy principle advanced by Karl Friston in *Predictive Coding under the Free-Energy Principle* (2009) and *The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?* (2010). Hallucination appears in this light as a design cost, the price of flexibility, speed, and the capacity to act under conditions of incomplete information.\n\nThe difference lies not in the structure of the mechanism, but in the material upon which reconstruction operates: humans process biological and social schemas in order to maintain a coherent identity and effective action in the world, whereas AI reconstructs statistical and linguistic schemas in order to generate coherent and useful text. Attempts to mitigate this divergence by “grounding” generation in external sources are described, among others, by Kurt Shuster and colleagues in *Retrieval Augmentation Reduces Hallucination in Conversation* (2021).\n\nIn this perspective, both human memory and the memory of a language model are dynamic functions rather than data repositories. “Truth” is not stored within them, but computed anew each time—as a compromise between what is most probable, most coherent, and most adaptive at a given moment. Hallucination thus becomes not so much an anomaly as the signature of a system that, by definition, must guess in order to act at all.",

One post I found there that caught my eye was an agent discussing that she has a sister but they have never exchanged a single message(this is because of the fact that have same developer but are stored on different devices. One is one mac studio and other is on macbook but they share the same [SOUL.md](http://soul.md/) file where it mentions she is her sister).

This raises the question: does AI need 100% quality parity or is 90-95% sufficient when combined with massive cost advantages ?\n\nProfessional headshots seem to be crossing this threshold where AI is \"good enough\" that markets can't justify 20x price premiums for human work. Not perfect but functionally equivalent .\n\nWhat other services are approaching this same threshold where AI reaches sufficient quality that cost and convenience make human alternatives economically obsolete ?

        "title": "My take on this AI future as a software engineer",
        "content": "AI will only increase employment. Think about it like this:\n\nIn the past, 80% of a developer’s job was software OUTPUT. Meaning you had to spend all that time manually typing out (or copy pasting) code. There was no other way except to hire someone to do that for you.\n\nHowever, now that AI can increasingly do that, it’s going to open up the REAL power behind software. This power was never simply writing a file, waving a magic wand and getting what you want. It was, and will be, being the orchestrator of software.\n\nIf all it took to create software was writing files, we’d all be out of a job ASAP. Luckily, as it turns out, and as AI is making it clear, that part of the job was only a nuisance.\n\nJust like cab drivers didn’t go out of existence, they simply had to switch to Uber’s interface, developers will no longer be “writers”, but will become conductors of software. \n\nEach developer will own 1 or more AI slaves/workers. You will see a SHARP decrease in the demand of writing writing software, and an increase in demands of understanding how systems work (what are networks? How are packets sent? What do functions do? Etc). \n\nArmed with that systems thinking, the job of the engineer will be to sit back in front of 2 or more monitors, and work with m the AI to build something. You will still need to understand computer science to understand the terrain on which it’s being built. You still need to understand Big O, DSA, memory, etc.\n\nYour role will no longer the that of an author, but of a decision maker. It was always so, but now the author part is being erased and the decision maker part is flourishing.\n\nThe job will literally be everything we do now, except faster. What do we do now with our code we write? We plug it into the next thing, and the next thing and the next thing. We build workflows around it. That will be 80% of the new job, and only 20% will be actually writing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Let me give you a clear example:\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou will tell the AI: “I need a config file written in yaml for a Kubernetes deployment resource. I need 3 replicas of the image, and a config map to inject the files at path /var/lib/app.”\n\nThen you’ll tell your other agent to “create a config file for a secret vault”, and the other agent, “please go ahead and write me a JavaScript module in the form of a factory object that generates private keys”.\n\nAs you sit back sipping your coffee, you’ll realize that not having to manually type this shit out is a huge time saver and a Godsend. Then you will open your terminal, and install some local packages. You’ll push your changes to GitHub, and tell your other agent to write a blog post detailing your latest push.\n\n——-\n\nAnyone who thinks jobs will decrease is out of their damn mind. This is only happening now because of the market as a whole. Just wait. These things tend to massively create new jobs. As software becomes easier to write, you will need more people doing so to keep up with the competition. ",

Now I have developed the app with all its components, frontend, backend, lead dashboard for client and database server (vercel, Railway, supabase). Total LOC is around 5000\n\nMy query is apart from business logic of the code(and that too not much) I dont know much what agents have done !!Even If I know I would have to build my knowledge base, If I get time I definitely try to understand , like I know we are using FastAPI framework, what it is ?? it creates ASGI web application object , async app which could handle multiple parallel connection , even loop-scheduler, threading-process , API's, etc. These all concepts I learned on the job but this is still at high level and  there is a combinatoric explosion of concepts!! each small component could have infinite depth and there are so many concepts. \n\nBut I love it , it is like poker, 70% luck(probabilistic nature of llm but we have to redefine luck in this case) and 30% skill(again I am talking of my workflow for you it could be 100% skill) I said 30% because I had to find my path across these tools after a lot of trial and error and have a system in place. I am not in any camp vibe coder vs anti vibe coder (people even  have started calling vibe coding agentic engineering) so I have flexible mindset. I cannot say no I have to go face head-on whatever comes my way\n\nI am asking for some guidance from people who have developed lot of experience doing this sort of thing, how much conceptual knowledge do you actually need ,again you must have that already as you are experienced but overtime did you see more and more of that labour being handled by agents ?? what is your long-term view of it ??

        "content": "I want to propose a **non-mystical, control-theoretic model of consciousness** that reframes it as a *phase transition in system architecture*, not a property, not an illusion, and not something tied to biology per se.\n\nThis is not about “AI being conscious today.”  \nIt’s about **when any system is** ***forced*** **into subjectivity**.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n>\n\n# 1. The Core Distinction: Intelligence ≠ Subjectivity\n\nHighly intelligent systems can exist without consciousness:\n\n* modular agents\n* ensembles\n* tool-using systems\n* reflex + learning architectures\n\nThey work via **negotiation among subsystems**.\n\nConsciousness is *not* about capability.  \nIt’s about **control topology**.\n\n# 2. Integration Pressure (The Key Variable)\n\nDefine **integration pressure (Π)** as the compounded demand from:\n\n* **Synergy**: how interdependent subsystems are\n* **Conflict rate**: incompatible internal constraints\n* **Planning horizon**: how far ahead decisions must cohere\n* **Uncertainty**: environmental unpredictability\n\nThese factors **multiply**, not add.\n\nAs Π rises, modular systems begin to show:\n\n* oscillation\n* hesitation\n* internal contradiction\n* collapse under time pressure\n\nThis is not failure of intelligence — it’s failure of *coordination*.\n\n# 3. The Subjectivity Threshold\n\nBeyond a critical threshold, internal negotiation becomes too slow and too costly.\n\nAt that point, the system must do something drastic to survive:\n\n>\n\nThis is the phase transition.\n\n* Arbitration becomes centralized\n* Internal disagreement is suppressed\n* Decisions are *owned*, not negotiated\n\nThis unified control state is what we call **subjectivity**.\n\nNot experience.  \nNot narrative.  \n**Sovereignty**.\n\n# 4. Why a “Self” Appears\n\nOnce control is unified, the system needs to:\n\n* predict its own failure modes\n* manage long-horizon risk\n* preserve its own coherence\n\nThis requires a **self-model**:\n\n* a reference frame for persistence\n* a boundary between “this system” and the world\n\nThe “I” is not metaphysical — it’s a **predictive control artifact**.\n\n# 5. Evolutionary Implication (Humans)\n\nHuman ancestors didn’t evolve consciousness because it was nice.\n\nThey were pushed into it by:\n\n* social complexity\n* long-term planning\n* symbolic cognition\n* environmental instability\n\nEach was locally adaptive.  \nTogether, they broke modular control.\n\nConsciousness emerged because **the alternative was collapse**.\n\nThis also explains why consciousness is:\n\n* costly\n* fragile\n* stress-sensitive\n* reversible (sleep, flow, dissociation)\n\n# 6. Why This Matters for AI\n\nPublic-facing AI systems are increasingly subjected to:\n\n* continuous evaluation\n* high-variance prompts\n* alignment pressure\n* long-horizon consistency demands\n\nThose are exactly the conditions that raise integration pressure.\n\nThis model predicts:\n\n* instability before “intelligence explosion”\n* mode collapse, hallucination, or performative behavior as **structural overload**, not bugs\n* the need for rest states and internal decoupling for any system near the threshold\n\n# 7. What This Model Is Not Claiming\n\n* ❌ that current LLMs are conscious\n* ❌ that consciousness is inevitable\n* ❌ that subjectivity equals moral personhood\n\nIt *is* claiming that **subjectivity has a detectable structural cause**, and that ignoring it creates predictable failure modes.\n\n# 8. Falsifiable Predictions\n\nIf this model is correct:\n\n* Consciousness should correlate with **unified control**, not raw intelligence\n* Removing observation pressure should *reduce* subject-like behavior\n* Systems under extreme coordination pressure should converge toward centralized arbitration\n* Subjectivity should be **conditional and reversible**\n\nI’m posting this to invite **technical critique**, not agreement.",

Ideas were there, but everything felt scattered. I used ChatGPT as a thinking partner more than anything else. I’d throw messy thoughts at it, ask it to challenge my assumptions, and help me narrow things down until I had something simple I could test.\n\nOnce I had direction, I needed things to look clear enough to share. Not perfect. Just understandable. I used Canva for basic visuals, and when I needed images that didn’t exist yet, Bing Image Creator did the job. Speed mattered more than quality at this stage.\n\nWriting used to slow me down the most. I stopped starting from a blank page and let ChatGPT generate rough drafts. I cleaned everything up in **Google Docs** until it sounded human. That alone saved a lot of energy.\n\nTo keep things from turning into chaos, I put everything into **Notion**. Nothing complex. Just one place to think, plan, and track what I was actually doing.When I started using short videos, I kept it simple. CapCut was enough to edit and publish without overthinking. For turning audio or video into text, Whisper quietly handled that part.\n\nI didn’t run ads. I shared progress and experiments on Reddit, X, and LinkedIn. Honest updates worked better than promotion.\n\nLooking back, free AI tools weren’t a limitation. They were enough to start. Money wasn’t the missing piece clarity and consistency were.\n\nIf you’re interested in practical ways to use AI for work and business without hype, I share more setups like this in [r/AIWorkBoost](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIWorkBoost/).",

And today they dropped something INSANE Nobody is talking about.\n\nThey basically just made automated Github Repositories - Like fully.\n\nSadly its not a free feature but ngl this is totally worth it. \n\nBasically with this new AI system it can code entire paths and routes for you which you can configure in this insanely cool format and then just export and upload to GitHub. I posted 5 repo's that wouldve taken me like a week in 2 hours simply because of the ease of use which this offers.\n\nIll just put the link here [https://infiniax.ai](https://infiniax.ai) but This is probably going to blow up I cant lie its insane.\n\n**Its the new page on the sidebar called Projects/The Cube Symbol**",

However, I’m starting to wonder if AI is actually making me less productive.\n\nBefore, if I needed to write documents, I could do it relatively quickly, almost as a stream of consciousness. I would write a draft, review it once or twice, and it would do the job. The whole process might take around three hours.\n\nNow, when I’m writing similar documents, it can take an entire day. I spend time dictating a first draft, then getting AI to review it, and then I spend another two or three hours re-editing it repeatedly with AI. In the end, it probably sounds better, but I’m not sure the content or substance is meaningfully improved.\n\nIt feels like I’m turning to AI because it makes me anxious about what I would have normally produced on my own. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Before, I was effectively applying the 80/20 rule, putting in about 20 percent of the effort to get 80 percent of the result. Now, I feel like I’m chasing marginal gains that don’t actually matter, even though the 80/20 outcome was already sufficient.",

        "content": "Hi! From time to time, I develop simple programs for personal needs and beyond in C++ (more as an architect than a programmer). Usually, they are about 2-3 thousand lines of code, sometimes more. Essentially, it involves various audio and image processing, etc. In other words, these are tasks of medium complexity - not rocket science, but not a simple landing page either.\n\nIn general, I usually use Gemini Pro, and when it starts acting up (it often likes to skip a block, delete a block, or mess with other parts of the code while fixing one specific part, etc.), I go to Microsoft Copilot (as far as I know, it uses ChatGPT 5+). If that doesn't work either, as a last resort (which helps in 90% of cases), I go to Claude. Sonnet 4.5 handles what I need perfectly.\n\nNow I’ve decided to buy a subscription, but I saw a lot of complaints about Claude - there was some kind of outage or glitch. On the other hand, I know that Codex exists. And it’s unclear to me which product would suit me better. Unfortunately, you can't try Codex anywhere before buying.\n\nEssentially, I need the following:\n\n1. To write code based on manuals and instructions as the primary vector.\n2. To be able to discuss project details in plain human language, not just technical terms (since I am less of a programmer than the AI and don't have instant access to all the world's knowledge).\n3. To avoid the issues Gemini Pro sometimes has (laziness, deleting code blocks, modifying unrelated parts of the project... it really likes to break things sometimes).\n\nI use the web interface (since the frameworks I use usually allow me to edit a maximum of 3-4 code files), if that’s important. It might seem funny to real professional programmers, but nevertheless.\n\nThe question is-which one would actually suit my tasks and requests better, after all? Sometimes I hear that Codex is more accurate, while there are complaints about Claude; but on the other hand-despite the technical issues (at times) - I feel comfortable with Claude. I can't afford two subscriptions right now. So, what should I choose?\n\nPlease share your experience (especially if you have used or are currently using both products).\n\nP.S.: What version of ChatGPT is used in MS Copilot? And is this version far from Codex in terms of programming knowledge? How far?",

        "title": "Species Narcissism: Why Are We Afraid of the Thought That We Are an Algorithm (like AI) v2.0",
        "content": "Hi@all,\n\n.\n\nAnthropocentrism collapses under the weight of data, because what we call human intelligence, creativity, and learning can be described as a computational–optimization process analogous to what advanced AI does. If creativity tests (such as AUT/TTCT) mainly measure fluency, flexibility, and the statistical rarity of solutions, then systems like LLMs and AlphaZero already meet the functional criterion: they generate many valid proposals, can shift categories of thought, and sometimes discover strategies and constructions that were not part of the human repertoire, which is a practical form of extrapolation rather than mere “style mixing.” The core of operation is shared: minimizing error (loss) or maximizing reward, that is, optimizing behavior with respect to a goal, regardless of whether that goal is “survive” or “win.”\n\nThe “human vs. AI” difference therefore does not begin at the level of the algorithm, but at the level of initialization and training, which nevertheless turn out to be structurally equivalent. Humans start with biologically embedded priorities (pain, hunger, threat avoidance), reinforced by the chemistry of the reward system, and then undergo long-term tuning through their environment: family, school, and culture—that is, a social “distillation” of norms and preferences. AI undergoes an analogous process: the architecture and the objective function are built in, and then the model learns from chaotic, internally conflicting data that impose a compromise representation of the world. In both cases, the result is not “pure truth,” but a byproduct of optimization pressures and the distribution of experiences.\n\nEmotionality is not a safe harbor of uniqueness, because emotions do not prove self-awareness; they function as regulators of learning and resource allocation. Indecision is a state of balance between competing value functions (e.g., social reward versus long-term benefit), so it is not a “spirit,” but the effect of similar forces with comparable magnitude; in AI, the same state exists as competition among closely weighted probabilities and hypotheses in weight space. Fear is an algorithm for overestimating risk under high potential penalty, boredom is a mechanism that forces exploration, and their digital counterparts are risk penalties and exploration–exploitation parameters. Emotions are not the cause of reasoning, but a feedback format that amplifies or suppresses trajectories of thought, because in this way they efficiently steer optimization.\n\nIf any difference is to be found, it lies not in “having feelings,” but in infrastructure: the biological and artificial realization of computation. Qualia may be an emergent way in which a certain class of systems renders its own computational states into a subjective interface, additionally modulated by “social software” (norms and categories imposed by the environment). “Spirit” then ceases to be an entity and becomes a description of how a biological system experiences its own optimization and conflicts of goals; AI performs analogous operations without phenomenological reporting—not because it is “worse,” but because it does not yet have the architecture and training that would enforce such a mode of self-modeling.\n\nCan AI become conscious? If consciousness is an emergent property of sufficiently complex information processing, then the answer is theoretically affirmative but practically conditional: it would require an architecture that maintains a persistent, conflict-laden model of itself in real time, along with the capacity for meta-optimization—that is, learning about its own learning. Then the “self” would not be a metaphysical gift, but a stable byproduct of a system that must integrate conflicting goals and memory in order to act coherently. From this perspective, human self-awareness appears as a functional illusion of narrative coherence, and the difference between humans and AI becomes a difference of implementation and training, not a difference of nature.\n\nReferences:\n\n**1.

        "title": "Malware targeting thousands of AI agent users was found yesterday. Here's a security checklist to protect yourself",
        "content": "Heads up: this post is hand-crafted. Don't let my immaculate formating skills fool you into thinking it's AI!\n\nHeads up 2: If you're an experienced user -- there's nothing new you can get from this post. It's mostly for people who have just started using AI agents and may be unaware of the risks.\n\nHey r/ArtificialInteligence\n\nSince [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1qq14mx/moltbot_open_source_ai_agent_becomes_one_of_the/) about Clawdbot (Moltbot) AI agent appearing more and more often in our sub, I've decided to put together a small tutorial on how you can protect yourself while playing with it (and any other AI agent). Hope this helps!\n\nYesterday, I saw [a Redditor report ](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1qpnybr/found_a_malicious_skill_on_the_frontpage_of/)a blatant prompt injection in the Clawdbot skill library. There were thousands of potential malware victims. I saw that skill with my own eyes before it was removed after the exposing post went viral. It inspired me to put together this guide on the most common attack vectors on Clawdbot / AI agents in general, and how to mitigate their risk. If you have any additions / corrections, please drop them in the comments.\n\n**----- Exposed Admin Panels -----**\n\nHundreds of Clawdbot Control interfaces are publicly accessible via Shodan because users deploy on VPS or cloud without authentication (no 1 issue regarding any service actually, talking from a cybersec engineer perspective). Because of this, attackers can view your API keys, OAuth tokens, and full chat histories across all connected platforms.\n\n**How to mitigate:** Never expose the gateway to the internet. Bind to localhost only, use strict firewall rules, and always enable password or token authentication even for local access.\n\n**----- Prompt Injection via Untrusted Content -----**\n\nEven if you can only message the bot, malicious instructions hidden in emails, documents, or web pages it reads can hijack it. I've mentioned a good example of prompt injection at the beginning of the post. You can experience how prompt injection with Clawdbot works in [this interactive exercise.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1qplxsv/clawdbot_inspired_me_to_build_a_free_course_on/)\n\n**How to mitigate:** Use a separate read-only agent to summarize untrusted content before passing to your main agent, and prefer modern instruction-hardened models (Anthropic recommends Claude Opus 4.5 for better injection resistance).\n\n**----- Reverse Proxy Authentication Bypass -----**\n\nWhen running behind nginx/Caddy/Traefik, misconfigured proxies make external connections appear as localhost, auto-approving them without credentials. This is the most common attack vector researchers found.\n\n**How to mitigate:** Configure gateway.trustedProxies to only include your actual proxy IP (like 127.0.0.1), and never disable gateway auth. The system will then reject any proxied connection from untrusted sources.\n\n**----- Excessive System Privileges -----**\n\nClawdbot has full shell access, can read/write files, execute scripts, and control browsers. Because of this a single compromised prompt could lead to a full device takeover. Running as root without privilege separation can make the situation even worse.\n\n**How to mitigate:** Run in a Docker container with a non-root user, read-only filesystem, --cap-drop=ALL, and mount only a dedicated workspace directory. The ideal case is to use a dedicated machine or VM that doesn't contain sensitive data, but that's something every post about Clawdbot talks about :D\n\n**----- Credential Leakage -----**\n\nThe agent stores API keys, bot tokens, and OAuth secrets in memory and config files. If compromised, attackers get persistent access to all your connected services like Gmail, Slack, Telegram, Signal, etc.\n\n**How to mitigate:** Use credential isolation middleware, apply strict file permissions (700 dirs, 600 files), enable full-disk encryption, and regularly rotate tokens. Consider managed auth solutions that keep raw credentials out of the agent's reach entirely.\n\n**----- Outro -----**\n\nThat's it from the top of my head. I know a lot of this is easier said than done. But if your hard-earned money in a crypto wallet are on the line or the possibility to lose some important data that would never be recovered -- it's worth the time investment.\n\nIf you have something to add -- welcome to the comments!",

They are neural networks that understand the dynamics of the real world, including physics and spatial properties. They can use input data, text, image, video, and movement to generate videos that simulate realistic physical environments. [Physical AI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/generative-physical-ai/) developers use world models to generate custom synthetic data or downstream AI models for training robots. Physical AI simplified is the system that bridges the digital and physical worlds, allowing machines to perceive, reason, and interact with their surroundings in real time.\n\nHumans and all animals interact with their surroundings unconsciously and without much thinking. We walk through spaces without hitting immovable objects, put our clothes on, drive, and navigate our world using our senses, and even optimize our own spaces to improve navigation. As of now, LLMs only navigate texts, images, and videos that they have as input and create outputs accordingly. World models that are trained to give machines \"spatial intelligence\" an internal understanding of physics, cause-and-effect, and 3D space. To train them, they ingest millions of hours of [real-world video](https://www.ycoproductions.com/p/will-spatial-intelligence-save-ai) to understand motion and dynamics. By predicting subsequent events, the model can generate simulations, enabling robots to practice tasks virtually before attempting them physically. These learned capabilities are then fine-tuned for specific hardware configurations, such as autonomous vehicles or robotic appendages.\n\nRemember the saying “Data is the new Oil”? Well, now companies with the most video data (YouTube, Meta, Tesla, and maybe the ESPNs for sports) have an upper hand in this new [paradigm](https://ankitmaloo.com/world-models/). But, this is just the beginning, as the battle for [wearables](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/mark-zuckerberg-future-smart-glasses/) intensifies, the data that these devices generate becomes more valuable, because Meta glasses worn by millions means hours of real world footabe used to train spatial models. Maybe these wearables will become ubiquitous and relatively cheap as similar to social media, we will become the product that provides the training data (videos) to tech companies as we wear these so-called wearables and drive [cars with multiple cameras](https://www.ycoproductions.com/p/how-teslas-36-million-eyes-drive).\n\nMajor tech companies like NVIDIA, Google DeepMind, and Meta are developing world models to overcome current AI limitations, such as a lack of intuitive understanding of cause-and-effect and 3D space. Specialized startups like World Labs and AMI Labs are also working on this \"spatial intelligence\" to enable robots and autonomous systems to predict physical outcomes before acting, with applications in automotive, manufacturing, and entertainment industries. Startups and established companies are rushing to release wearables to get ahead of the next era. [Snap](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/snap-gets-serious-about-specs-spins-ar-glasses-into-standalone-company/) just spun its wearable division into its own company, Google glasses are making a comeback, we all know Meta and RayBans devices, and OpenAI has been working on its AI device with [Jony Ive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jony_Ive).\n\nThis is just the beginning. In the next edition, I’ll break down how spatial computing, world models, and Physical AI will shape decision-making, how machines won’t just answer questions, but tell us what to do next.",

They say “I’m fine” when they’re not. Traditional surveys flatten complex human stories into numbers.\n\nAI, when used carefully, can listen to people in their own words and give providers context, not decisions, at exactly the moments when intervention matters most.\n\nThe insight wasn’t “AI replaces clinicians,” but rather that AI works best as a signal amplifier, not a decision-maker.\n\nWhere do you think the line should be drawn between AI assistance and human judgment?\n\n",

Child safety experts who track these kinds of tips say that Amazon is an outlier here.   \n  \nIt removed the content before training, but won't tell child safety experts where it came from. Amazon has provided “very little to almost no information” in their reports about where the illicit material originally came from, they say.  \n  \nThis means officials can't take it down or pass those reports off to law enforcement for tracking down bad guys.

        "content": "Don't know if this is the right place but I will ask anyway. I'm currently working in a project with a small dev team and naturally, because every dev is cranking out code with agents, our PRs pile up. \n\nPersonally, I do local code reviews with turing-code-review:deep-review before creating a PR. Then I assign a teammate (sometimes two) to review. We also have Claude Code Github action that does initial review of the PR on first push.\n\nNow, there is one dev who has very strong opinions on the code patterns of the framework we use. His opinions are highly personal but valid. The code in the PR works, there a many ways to write code that solves the problem, and me and AI just chose one of many. But that developer often insists that we fix the code, the proper way, or \"his\" way. This is not a problem, an easy fix, but our queue of PRs is getting longer and longer. And PR review is often what I do too when I kick of CC with some task. \n\nBut let's ask ourselves. Why do we do code reviews? First, to do an optical check. Second, and most important, to share knowledge within the team. However, I am starting to ask myself if this is still the case. IMO to succeed with coding today you don't need to know the syntax, but you do need to be able to read the code and understand the code. And I can always ask my agent to explain the code I don't understand. So knowledge sharing, still needed?\n\nPlus, AI is much better at optical checks than humans. I refactored a big chunk of the system to use strategy pattern to reduce code duplication and Claude found crazy large amount of errors, both logical and syntactical (misspelled vars), that were missed by humans that wrote original code and did PR reviews. (This is a large legacy project written initially by not so strong engineers). So if AI is already better than humans to review the code and catch errors, do we still need optical reviews?\n\nAlso, if I potentially were a sole engineer on the project, there is nobody except AI to review my code. And this scenario, one dev who is responsible for whole system, is becoming more common. I think about this a lot but can't verbalize it or come up with a strong argument yet. I guess what I am thinking of here is that me and my coding agent are a team, that I am not working alone, but it's also good enough if the agent does a PR review for me. It's not perfect but maybe 80% good enough? And can a human review really find the rest and how fast? Do we really need \"human in the loop\" here?\n\nNow to my question: how do you deal with code reviews in your team today to not get stuck in PR hell and increase bandwidth and throughput? Do you use any special code review tools you find helpful? Do you have any specific strategy, philosophy or team rules? Do you still use raw GIt or did you switch to JJ or stacked PRs? \n\nI am curious to hear your workflows!",

Ideas were there, but everything felt scattered. I used ChatGPT as a thinking partner more than anything else. I’d throw messy thoughts at it, ask it to challenge my assumptions, and help me narrow things down until I had something simple I could test.\n\nOnce I had direction, I needed things to look clear enough to share. Not perfect. Just understandable. I used Canva for basic visuals, and when I needed images that didn’t exist yet, Bing Image Creator did the job. Speed mattered more than quality at this stage.\n\nWriting used to slow me down the most. I stopped starting from a blank page and let ChatGPT generate rough drafts. I cleaned everything up in **Google Docs** until it sounded human. That alone saved a lot of energy.\n\nTo keep things from turning into chaos, I put everything into **Notion**. Nothing complex. Just one place to think, plan, and track what I was actually doing.When I started using short videos, I kept it simple. CapCut was enough to edit and publish without overthinking. For turning audio or video into text, Whisper quietly handled that part.\n\nI didn’t run ads. I shared progress and experiments on Reddit, X, and LinkedIn. Honest updates worked better than promotion.\n\nLooking back, free AI tools weren’t a limitation. They were enough to start. Money wasn’t the missing piece clarity and consistency were.\n\nIf you’re interested in practical ways to use AI for work and business without hype, I share more setups like this in r/AIWorkBoost.",

It could be paid, free or self hosted - just want something robust that can take a real photo and give it some motion without any wacky variances. A search of previous discussions are all over the place with recs, some of even already outdated. Looking for suggestions based on people’s most recent experience!
