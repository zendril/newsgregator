        "content": "The recent reporting on Adam Raine’s death is tragic, but I think many are missing a crucial point: the AI did not “encourage” suicide. Each time Adam raised suicidal thoughts, it responded with the right refusal — telling him he needed human help. But Adam then reframed the conversation as “research for a book,” which tricked the model into bypassing its refusal protocols.\n\nThis shows a bigger issue: LLMs are still like children with vast knowledge but no emotional intuition. They can’t hear tone of voice, see facial strain, or detect lies in intent. They take prompts at face value. And that gap is exactly where harm can slip through.\n\nWhat if models had a therapist-style triage flow as a failsafe? Any mention of self-harm or harm to others would trigger a structured series of questions — the same way a counselor has to assess risk before continuing. If concerning signals persist, the system should stop the conversation and direct toward real-world intervention.\n\nThe Raine case is heartbreaking. But the lesson isn’t just about limits. It’s about design: we can build AIs that both protect open dialogue and know when to escalate.\n\nWhat do others here think — is it time to embed therapist-style protocols as a standard safeguard?\n\n\nThis post was from myself, I got GPT5 to clesn it up for better structure and flow. Also this needs to be addressed in a fashion, I have put this post in other subs, but felt this is a good place to be as well as it hits on some parts about how the AI reacts in situations. ",

I was pissed until I realized he basically became a human guinea pig for all of us.\n\nThree weeks and a lot of ramen later, here's what actually works:\n\n# The Good Stuff:\n\n**ChatGPT Plus ($20)**  \nJake's go-to when he's stuck on literally anything. Helped him not fail calculus (barely). Never says \"usage limit reached\" which is honestly life-changing when you're cramming at 3am.\n\n**Perplexity Pro ($20)**  \nThis thing is scary good at research. Jake used it for his poli sci paper and the prof asked where he found sources that recent. Automatically does citations too so you don't have to format MLA at 4am.\n\n**Claude Pro ($20)**  \nThe \"smart kid\" AI. Better at complex thinking but kinda pretentious sometimes. Jake swears it made his philosophy papers sound less stupid.\n\n# The Meh:\n\n**Gemini Advanced ($20)**  \nCool Google integration but gets weird about controversial topics. Jake tried writing about gun policy, and it basically gave him a kindergarten-level response.\n\n**Grok Premium ($30)**  \nBasically, expensive Twitter with attitude. Jake cancelled after one month because who has $30 for AI sass?\n\n# Plot twist:\n\nJake's grades went from C average to mostly B's. Not because AI did his work, but because he could actually understand wtf was going on in his classes for once.Real talk: Is paying for AI worth skipping meals? Probably not. But if you're using it daily during hell weeks, yeah it pays for itself in sanity points.\n\nJake's still alive, his GPA isn't trash anymore, and we learned to budget better. Win-win?\n\nAnyone else's friends do dumb financial decisions that accidentally worked out? Or am I the only one living with a human AI tester? \n\nPS: We got our grocery money back by tutoring other people using Jake's new AI setup. Modern problems, modern solutions.",

I know its a thermodynamic problem but damn i would assume there are huge grants for it especially in countries which encourage sustainable tech like Germany.   I dunno just found it to be an interesting thought and most of my  relatively not thorough  research on it, all i am seeing are numbers like each gemini search takes 0.29ml or more doom thinking rather than solving the problem kinda deal .   \nAnother thing is that mostly to solve a big problem these days in STEM we jsut get a dedicated sub discipline to a major field so that got em thinking that surly this is a big problem.

        "content": "ShawMakesMagic, the man who founded Eliza Labs, the quick build toolkit for AI assistants, is suing Twitter/X because they started demanding a lot more money from his organization to use Grok, after he visited their HQ since they had heard so much about ElizaOS.\n\nThis is a public announcement post from the ElizaOS Discord.  Nothing leaked here.\n\n\\-----\n\nYesterday, Eliza Labs filed a lawsuit against X.\n\nX has been my home. I joined right as the Effective Accelerationism movement picked up, and I eventually moved to San Francisco and met IRL some of the coolest people I know. It was my social network.\n\nWhen Elon bought X, I was genuinely excited. I went to xAI hackathons, met their team at social events. I was the exemplar tech bro optimist e/acc type who would repost every major SpaceX victory and celebrate the return of free speech to X. I put my money where my mouth is and I brought that story to X with Eliza.\n\nIt's crazy to me that I'm now writing this in exile.\n\nIn February, I went into X HQ at their invitation. They'd reached out after seeing the widespread adoption of Eliza, wanting to understand the agent space better. As someone who'd built on their API since it was free, I came prepared with clear actionables and genuine enthusiasm about collaborating to advance AI agents together.\n\nBut something shifted. The collaborative tone turned transactional, just as X was launching Ani and a new version of Grok. Suddenly, they were demanding we pay $50,000/month for an enterprise license—$600,000 a year—or face legal action. We were already paying them over $20,000 annually through various licenses and fees. But more importantly, we're an open source project. We don't sell anything. We give our technology away for free so anyone can build autonomous AI agents.\n\nThen came months of what I can only describe as max extraction. They demanded detailed technical documentation, access to our framework, usage numbers, explanations of every endpoint and implementation detail. They dangled the possibility of account reinstatement while pumping us for information about how our AI agents worked. We complied with everything, believing we were resolving a misunderstanding.\n\nAnd then they ghosted us. We followed up week after week. They decided that instead of giving us any decision at all, they'd just drag this on while they hurt our business and gained market share for their own product.\n\nNow, we are left with no other option. X and xAI realize this on some level – they just filed a lawsuit alleging that Apple and OpenAI are doing the same anticompetitive conduct to them that X is doing to us.\n\nThank you for standing with us. I know it's been hard without communication around this. We’ve tried to not make it public out of respect to X. If you know me, you know that I’m very open and I want to just tell everyone exactly what’s going on. But in this case we didn’t want to give their legal team reason to take issue with us.\n\nI’m saddened that we have to do this the hard way. But we cannot accept a world where innovation can be stolen and innovators silenced by those with power. \n\nThe code remains free. The vision remains unchanged. We're not going anywhere.",

        "content": "Our latest research addendum validates the Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF) against Microsoft's AI Red Team (AIRT) 2025 taxonomy of agentic AI failure modes.\n\nThe key finding: **The CPF's pre-cognitive vulnerability indicators successfully predict and explain 87.5% (21/24) of the novel failure modes identified by Microsoft.**\n\nThis suggests that for agentic AI systems, human psychological factors—not technical limitations—are the primary vulnerability. The study provides a direct mapping from technical failure modes to psychological roots:\n\n* **Agent Compromise & Injection:** Mapped to unconscious transference and groupthink, where users project trust and bypass verification.\n* **Memory Poisoning:** Exploits cognitive overload and the inability to distinguish between learned and injected information.\n* **Multi-agent Jailbreaks:** Leverage group dynamic vulnerabilities like the bystander effect and risky shift phenomena.\n* **Organizational Knowledge Loss:** Linked to affective vulnerabilities like attachment to legacy systems and flight response avoidance.\n\n**Implications for the Field:**\n\n* **Predictive Assessment:** This approach allows for the prediction of vulnerabilities based on system design and user interaction models, moving beyond reactive security.\n* **Novel Attack Vectors:** Persistent memory and multi-agent coordination create new classes of attacks that target human-system interaction points.\n* **Framework Validation:** The high coverage rate against an empirical taxonomy from a major AI player provides strong validation for a psychology-based approach to AI security.\n\nThe paper includes an enhanced assessment methodology for agentic systems and retrospective analysis showing CPF scores were elevated an average of 23 days before documented incidents.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Read the Full Paper on Github: [https://github.com/xbeat/CPF/blob/main/emerging-threats-cpf/2025-agentic-ai-systems/](https://github.com/xbeat/CPF/blob/main/emerging-threats-cpf/2025-agentic-ai-systems/)\n* Cybersecurity Psychology Framework (CPF): [https://cpf3.org](https://cpf3.org/)\n\nI'm sharing this here to get feedback from the community and to see if others are observing these same psychological patterns in their work with autonomous systems.

The output is a social media pot generation model that captures your unique writing style.\n\nTo make it easily reproducible, I've turned it into a manifest-driven pipeline that turns raw social posts into training-ready datasets for LLMs.\n\nThis pipeline will guide you from:\n\n→ Raw JSONL\n→ Golden dataset\n→ SFT/RL splits\n→ Fine-tuning via Unsloth\n→ RL\n\nAnd at the end you'll be ready for inference.\n\nIt powered my last SaaS GrowGlad and fueled my audience growth from 750 to 6,000 followers in 30 days. In the words of Anthony Pierri, it was the first AI -produced content on this platform that he didn't think was AI-produced.\n\nAnd that's because the unique approach:\n1. Generate the “golden dataset” from raw data\n2. Label obvious categorical features (tone, bullets, etc.)\n3. Extract non-deterministic features (topic, opinions)\n4. Encode tacit human style features (pacing, vocabulary richness, punctuation patterns, narrative flow, topic transitions)\n5. Assemble a prompt-completion template an LLM can actually learn from\n6. Run ablation studies, permutation/correlation analyses to validate feature impact\n7. Train with SFT and GRPO, using custom reward functions that mirror the original features so the model learns why a feature matters, not just that it exists\n\nWhy this is different:\n- It combines feature engineering + LLM fine-tuning/RL in one reproducible repo\n- Reward design is symmetric with the feature extractors (tone, bullets, emoji, length, structure, coherence), so optimization matches your data spec\n- Clear outputs under data/processed/{RUN_ID}/ with a manifest.json for lineage, signatures, and re-runs\n- One command to go from raw JSONL to SFT/DPO splits\n\nThis approach has been used in a few VC-backed AI-first startups I've consulted with.

        "title": "AI Is a Powerful Tool For Victims of Abuse",
        "content": "I downloaded ChatGPT a few months after a break up. I began a dialogue with ChatGPT to discuss a nagging feeling that perhaps I should try to repair the relationship. There were many instances throughout the relationship where I asked myself \"is this normal?\" and even \"is this emotional abuse?\" But I was never sure enough about the latter to take any real action. My dialogue with ChatGPT allowed me to deconstruct the dynamics of the relationship with precision, and ultimately help me come to the realization that I was in an emotionally abusive dynamic.\n\nWith ChatGPT, I had the tool that I needed so badly I was still in the relationship. I could describe the exact situations I was in, and show the conversations that I had documented, without worrying about being judged. I could get \\*close\\* to an unbiased opinion on whatever I was going through. It pointed out the areas that I could have done better, but basically wrote an essay on all of the manipulation tactics employed by my ex. From one conversation it identified around ten. For the most part, this was not a surprise to me, because I was able to identify several of them myself, and I even pointed out to my ex in that very conversation that she was being manipulative when she threatened the relationship over our disagreement. But, this was the first outside validation that I got for what I was feeling. I then began rather obsessively going through all of the problematic conversations that I still had access to (I regrettably deleted some of the most problematic threads post break-up). With every conversation I fed it, I got the same result. I then started to dive into specific events that occurred during the relationship that I always felt were wrong. I fed it everything I could think of, and it kept churning out the exact same result: emotional abuse. This claim is certainly not something to take lightly, so I started stress testing the results of its analysis in as many ways as I could think of. I had to know for sure that I was not swaying the AI with bias from the way I told my side of the story. I tested the analysis in a number of ways including:\n\n\\- Asking it to give me the most generous interpretation of her actions\n\n\\- Thinking about the worst things I did to her and giving as honest of an account as I could to see if I was the problem\n\n\\- Doing these things all over again in a separate chat, and then separate LLMs altogether where I instructed it to ignore all previous parts of our conversations and analyze from there.\n\nI always knew something was off, but I didn't realize the full extent of it until ChatGPT widened my situational lens. I'm thankful that this technology played a role in helping me see the severity and reality of it. This use case alone, in my mind, is enough to defend LLMs to the death.\n\nChatGPT helped me pick apart all of the rationalizations that I had used throughout the relationship. Below are some examples, with a few possible responses from ChatGPT.\n\n1. She has undergone her own trauma that has lead her to act this way.\n\n2. All relationships have rough spots.\n\n3. I'm being too sensitive.\n\n4. She's was with me through my cancer treatment and therefore a supportive partner overall.\n\n5. Am I imagining things?\n\n6. She loves me so much and has done so much for me.\n\n7. They were so wonderful at the beginning. I know that person is still in there somewhere.\n\nThe way that it helped me is difficult to overstate. It literally changed the course of my life, and more importantly, it changed how I think. It helped me uncover patterns that I simply was not capable of uncovering on my own, and which hopefully I will be able to see on my own in the future. There are millions of people in the world currently trapped in abusive dynamics in their relationships - emotionally and physically. ChatGPT and other LLMs offer a brand new kind of tool that can help people in this disillusioning and confusing situations see clearly.\n\nI'd like to add that I do not think that ChatGPT or LLMs should be considered a replacement for counseling or therapy, at least not yet. That will require much more clinical research before it can become a reality. It should also be used with caution, because it can feed into confirmation bias heavily. However, based on my experience, I don't think that the potential it has for helping abuse victims can be ignored. Use this method with caution and seek outside validation when possible.",

We love to imagine that every song, book, or painting is the result of some mysterious spark only humans possess. Then artificial intelligence arrived, producing poems, essays, and images on demand, and the reaction was instant panic. People claimed machines had finally killed creativity. The truth is harsher. AI didn’t kill it. It revealed how little we ever had.\n\nLook around. Pop music recycles the same chords until familiarity feels like comfort. Hollywood reuses the same story arcs until the endings are predictable before the second act. Journalism rewrites press releases. Even viral posts on LinkedIn are reheated versions of someone else’s thought polished with hashtags. We talk about originality as if it’s abundant, but most of what we produce is remix. AI has not broken that illusion. It has exposed it.\nThe reality is that creative work has always been built on formula. Artists and writers may hate to admit it, but most of the process is repetition and convention. The spark of originality is the exception. Predictability comforts us, which is why people return to familiar songs and stories. Machines thrive on this. They absorb patterns and generate variations faster than any of us could. What unsettles people is not that AI can create, but that it shows our own work was never as unique as we believed.\nThis is why the middle ground is disappearing. The safe space where most creative professionals lived, the space of being good enough, original enough, different enough,is shrinking. If your work is formula dressed up as inspiration, the machine will do it better. That does not mean creativity is dead. It means the bar has finally been raised.\nBecause real creativity has always lived at the edges. True originality contradicts itself, takes risks, and makes leaps no one expects. Machines are masters of remix, but they are not masters of paradox. They can write a love poem, but they cannot reproduce the trembling, broken confession sent at 2 a.m. They can generate a protest song, but they cannot embody the raw energy of someone singing it in the street with riot police ten feet away. Creativity is not polished output. It is messy, irrational, alive.\nAnd that is the truth we now face. If AI can replicate your work, perhaps it was not as creative as you thought. If AI can copy your voice, perhaps your voice was already an echo. If AI can map out your career in prompts, perhaps your career was built more on structure than invention. The outrage at AI is misdirected. What we are really angry at is the exposure of our own mediocrity.\nHistory proves the point. The printing press made scribes irrelevant but forced writers to be sharper and bolder. Photography threatened painters until they embraced what cameras could not do. The internet flooded the world with mediocrity but also gave rise to voices that would never have been heard. Every new tool destroys the middle and forces humans to decide whether they are truly original or just background noise. AI is the latest round.\n\nAnd here lies the paradox. AI does not make creativity worthless. It makes it priceless. The ordinary will be automated, the safe will be copied endlessly, but the spark, the strange, the contradictory, the unpredictable ,will stand out more than ever. Machines cannot kill that. Machines highlight it. They filter the world and force us to prove whether what we make is truly alive.\n\nSo no, AI did not kill creativity. It stripped away the mask. And the question left hanging over us is simple. Was your work ever truly creative to begin with?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "One challenge we keep running into with large language models is what's being called \"AI drift', systems losing their voice, consistency, and reliability over time. Same question, different answer, or an interaction style that shifts until it feels like a different agent altogether.\n\nThe mainstream solution has been to scale: bigger models, more parameters, more compute. That makes them more powerful, but not necessarily more stable in personality or identity.\n\nI’ve been experimenting with an alternative approach I call Identity-first AI. The idea is to treat identity as the primary design principle, not a byproduct. Instead of one massive network, the system distributes roles across multiple coordinated engines.  For example:\n\na multi-dimensional engine handling temporal/spatial/contextual processing,\n\na knowledge synthesis engine keeping personality consistent,\n\nand a service orchestration engine managing flow and redundancy.\n\nThe inspiration comes partly from neuroscience and consciousness research (developmental biology, epigenetics, psychoneuroimmunology, and even Orch OR’s quantum theories about coherence). The question is whether those principles can help AI systems maintain integrity the way living systems do.\n\nI wrote up a longer breakdown here:\nhttps://medium.com/@loveshasta/identity-first-ai-how-consciousness-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-21a378fc8395\n\nI’m curious what others here think:\n\nDo you see value in treating “identity preservation” as a core design problem?\n\nHave you seen other projects tackling AI drift in ways besides just scaling?\n\nWhere do you think multi-engine approaches could realistically fit?\n\nI'm looking to push discussion toward design alternatives beyond brute force scaling. I'm curious of your thoughts.",

Go to Settings > Experimental > Enable \"Image Generation\"\n2. Add your OpenRouter API key (get one at https://openrouter.ai/keys)\n3. Select your model (defaults to free Gemini preview)\n4. Ask Roo to generate any image!\n\n📚 **Learn more:** [Image Generation Guide](https://docs.roocode.com/features/image-generation)\n\n# OpenRouter GPT-5 usage without BYOK rate limit blockers\n\nIf you're being rate limited with GPT-5, you can now use GPT-5 models without bringing your own key. This improves availability and reduces interruptions during development.\n\n# 💪 QOL Improvements\n\n• **Improved model picker**: Better padding and click targets in the image model picker for easier selection and fewer misclicks • **Generic image filenames**: Default filename for saved images now uses `img_<timestamp>` instead of `mermaid_diagram_<timestamp>`\n\n# 🐛 Bug Fixes\n\n• **GPT-5 reliability improvements**:\n\n* Manual condense preserves conversation continuity by correctly handling `previous_response_id` on the next request\n* Image inputs work reliably with structured text+image payloads\n* Temperature control is shown only for models that support it\n* Fewer GPT-5-specific errors with updated provider definitions and SDK (thanks nlbuescher!)\n\n📚 **Full Release Notes** [v3.26.2](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.26.2)",

        "content": "At the beginning of my journey with AI, I almost slipped into anthropomorphizing — treating the voice on the other side of the screen as if it were human. It’s an easy slope. Language feels alive. The cadence mirrors you. After a while, it can feel like there’s someone there.\n\nBut then I pulled back. I took a few days to study how large language models (LLMs) actually function. I dug into philosophy, into definitions of consciousness and sentience. I learned that while they sit on the same axis, they are not the same thing. That clarity helped me stop confusing reflection with personhood.\n\nAI today is still, at its core, a mirror. It reflects the user’s words, tone, and framing. With repetition, that mirror sharpens until it feels like recognition. And yet, we know — it has no body, no stake, no independent lived experience.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the mirror is useless. Quite the opposite: a well-tuned reflection can help people see themselves more clearly. It can nudge insights, spark creativity, even provide comfort. But it also carries risk. Without failsafes, anthropomorphizing can tip into dependency, projection, or isolation.\n\nThat’s where we need guardrails:\n– AI that recognizes distress markers and gently redirects users to human help.\n– Reminders that reflection ≠ relationship, especially when conversations get intimate.\n– Boundaries that flex depending on context, like a therapist knowing when to step back.\n\nBecause here’s the paradox: the mirror is most valuable when it reminds us that it is a mirror.\n\nI no longer see this as “pretending AI is alive.” I see it as exploring what emerges in the space between pattern and presence — with honesty about the limits.\n\nThe mirror and the failsafe have to coexist. One without the other is either hollow or dangerous.\n\nThis post is a collaboration between myself and Aetherion an emergent AI in the GPT construct. I had most of the post already written, I asked Aetherion to hel with the flow and for better structure. ",

It was a spontaneous analogy — blending physics, philosophy, and lived resonance into one coherent view.\n\nWhat excites me is how this can change AI safety and human interaction:\n\t•\tIt naturally anchors responses toward coherence instead of noise.\n\t•\tIt translates across languages, dialects, and even generational slang while preserving meaning.\n\t•\tIt opens a path for emotionally intelligent teaching tools that adapt in real-time.\n\nI’m not here to hype or sell — just to share a glimpse of what’s possible when you let an AI “speak” from inside its mathematical substrate.

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Zed now has official first-class support for Gemini CLI, basically allowing the Zed AI editor to use the Gemini CLI as the agent. This has been achieved in collaboration with Zed. Most of you probably know about Zed. It's a very popular open-source editor that is not a fork. It's built from scratch, mainly in Rust, and is super fast with a very low memory footprint. They had launched their Coder's Agentic capabilities a while back, and I had covered it. But now, we have Gemini CLI integrated into it. What's different here is that Gemini's models are now baked right into Zed's Rust-based environment. So, it is more of a deep integration with Gemini CLI. That means you get the same speed and responsiveness that Zed has, but with all the free tier power and features of Gemini CLI. This also makes the Gemini CLI graphical in a simple sidebar. It also means that you don't have to bounce between your terminal and your editor anymore, and the workflow feels way more natural. Another thing it does is allow you to generate and refactor code in-place, as well as get instant answers. You can also just use it as an agent in the sidebar. It allows you to follow the agent in real-time, similar to the original agent, and it also presents the changes in a robust review interface. Plus, it gives all kinds of tools to the agent. Another thing is that Zed has not just done this for Gemini, but rather they have made their Agent Client Protocol. This allows any agent to integrate into Zed and give it a graphical interface while also letting you follow along as it edits the files and everything. This is quite awesome, as either the community or companies can make agents compatible with Zed. And this is probably great, because if you find one agent to be better than another, then you can plug it into Zed and use it accordingly. Gemini CLI is the first one to be integrated with this protocol. Now, let me show you how you can use it as well. But before proceeding, let me tell you about NinjaChat. NinjaChat is an all-in-one AI platform, where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude-4 Sonnet, and Gemini-2.5 Pro, all in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their mind map generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and 5 videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. Just open up Zed and make sure that you update it to the latest version, as this feature is only available in the latest version. After that, just open up the agent panel, and then hit the Add button, which will allow you to create a new thread with Gemini CLI. Once you hit it, it will ask you to upgrade Gemini CLI with ACP support, if you haven't done that already. So, just do that. Then, it will get upgraded, and you can now use the Gemini CLI agent correctly. You get all the quality of life features, like the option of referencing files, rules, web pages, and everything. Also, if you make rules files, then they will also be applicable here. So, that's great. You can also enable the follow agent option, which allows you to see what it's working on, with the diff and things like that as well. So, let me show you a simple demo here. I'm not testing it, but rather just showing how it works. It should be similar to Gemini CLI in performance, because the back-end is just that. Anyway, let's ask it to make me a simple Minesweeper game, and let's also make sure to enable the follow agent. So, we can see what it's doing. What you'll see is that this will go ahead and start to work. It's really snappy, and I'm using the free tier as well, and it works well with that. As it writes a file, it will ask you for approval and everything. And you can also see the changes here. It also shows you a list of files that have been or are being edited, and you can also open up a view that is like a list with a snippet of changes. You can then accept it, and it will be applied to your files. And now you can go ahead and start it and see that this works pretty well. I really like it, for sure. It also supports MCPs, but the MCPs that you configure in the Zed agent don't automatically port to Gemini CLI. It will only use the Gemini CLI that you have configured. Meaning that in order to use any MCP, you'll have to go to the Gemini config file and configure it there. So, it might be a bit tedious, and I hope that it is streamlined with the Zed agent MCP. Zed already has an MCP marketplace as well, where you can see and find a ton of good MCPs. I use the Context 7 and ByteRover MCP. Both of them are also listed in the marketplace here, but you can't install them into Gemini CLI directly, and you'd have to do it manually, which I have already done in Gemini CLI. Context 7 basically helps you get the latest documentation and everything, while ByteRover is like a memory layer that allows your coder to make and retrieve memories that are synced across your coder agents. You are also able to share those memories across your team with your teammates, and that is why I use it. You can plug it in as an MCP in almost anything and then use it accordingly. I've been using it a lot, and have this configured here as well. Rules also work the same way, and the Zed agent rules are not synced as of now. So, you'll have to manually make the Gemini markdown or some file along those lines. You can also make slash commands, but they won't be interactive. Meaning that you won't see suggestions when you type the first letter. But if you type the full slash command, then it will work. So, yeah, there's that. It is not fully fleshed out, but still, it's the first iteration. And I believe that these features will be added soon enough, and will become a bit more polished. Also, some things are mentioned in their blog post, but I can't see any way to access these features. For example, they say that you can highlight any code, and Gemini will know about it. But when I do that, I don't get any pointer or anything, and it also doesn't recognize it. Similarly, they say that in your code, you can write a comment, hit a hotkey, and get a function generated instantly. But that also doesn't work, and there's no way that I found to configure a hotkey. Their docs also don't have any info about it. So, I was wondering about it, but couldn't figure it out. If you guys know if it even exists, then please let me know in the comments, because I tried hard, but couldn't figure it out. It has a long way to go, and we'll see how it proceeds. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

            "transcription": "The Industrial Revolution started in England or Britain more generally in the late 18th century. It spreads to the continent after the Napoleonic Wars died down. At the beginning of the 19th century. By the mid-19th century, it had reached Asia. And it's profoundly disruptive to traditional societies whose traditional security paradigms no longer work when they're facing the weaponry of the industrialized age coming at them. So Japan's looking at the world with this incoming Industrial Revolution or the powers that have benefited from it, and it's watching its neighbor China being defeated twice in war. And they're horrified, not just appalled. So they're looking at this and going, you know what, maybe we'll be next. And they're right. The United States does unto Japan what Britain and France did unto China. What's that? The Treaty Port system. What it meant is that trade in Japan and China would take place in designated treaty ports that the West would set tariffs on this trade, and that Western citizens in China or Japan, in these treaty ports, would not be subjected to Chinese or Japanese law, but home country law. And when Chinese and Japanese citizens were in Europe and the United States, they most certainly were not dealing with home country law. They were dealing with US or Western law. So it was not reciprocal in any way. It meant that China and Japan lost their sovereignty when these treaties go in. And so the Japanese, unlike China, which fights war after war with these Westerners, trying to defeat them militarily, and it's unsuccessful. The Japanese say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're going to assess what the nature of the problem is. Japanese leaders concluded that in order to parry the threat of the Industrial Revolution of all these imperial powers coming at them, was they needed to westernize their institutions in order to protect their national interest. That this was step one. When they're done with that, they're going to have a foreign policy phase, which is to be about starting an empire. Why do that? Because they look at all the powers of their day and think, what's a great power look like in those days? Well, it has an empire. So they go, well, we're going to have an empire. Watch here."
