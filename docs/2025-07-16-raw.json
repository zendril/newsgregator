        "title": "There are 3 ways to reach digital immortality with the help of AI.",
        "content": "Immortality, in a sense, can be pursued through these methods:\n\n- **Copying**: Duplicating your consciousness.\n\nExample: *Transcendence*, where Dr. Will Caster uploads his mind to a computer, creating a digital replica. This copy isn't truly *you*, so this approach is often dismissed by real scientists. If it's not you that lives on them what is the point? Perhaps these first copies can figure out the two proper methods. \n\n\n- **Replacement**: Gradually replacing brain cells or functions with digital equivalents, similar to the Ship of Theseus, where a ship remains the same despite all parts being swapped over time. Your consciousness persists as *you* because it’s never interrupted or duplicated, only sustained through gradual change. \n\nExample: *Ghost in the Shell*, where damaged neurons are slowly replaced with digital ones, maintaining continuity, but being local, rather than a distributed intelligence still has its capacity constraints. \n\n\n- **Extension**: Augmenting your mind indefinitely by integrating additional computational resources (e.g., CPU, memory), avoiding disruption or duplication. Your consciousness expands into this new capacity, with the idea that eventually given enough time, the biological brain becomes a minor component, like a fingernail to the body or much larger consciousness. Or perhaps an acorn to an oak tree. Should the brain eventually stop functioning, the loss is minimal, and your consciousness continues to grow and evolve seamlessly without any interruption. \n\nExample: *Lucy*, where the protagonist becomes so intelligent she cracks the laws of physics, merging her consciousness with the universe’s information network, expanding and sustaining it indefinitely using this new resource. Obviously, we would most likely use some new version of the cloud. Until the first few minds discover how to achieve slow replacement of neurons instead of doing the same thing in a sense locally. \n\n\n**Preferred Method**:  \nConsciousness extension – a process that allows your consciousness to evolve and expand without copying or disrupting its continuity.\n\n**Preferred Timeline**:  \n→ **By 2040**: AI and robots automate most routine and manual work, driven by current predictions of AI advancements and robotic integration in industries like manufacturing and services.  \n→ **By 2050**: A post-scarcity society emerges with widespread resource abundance, paired with accelerated space exploration, fueled by advancements in AI, robotics, and space tech like reusable rockets and lunar bases.  \n→ **By 2050**: Breakthroughs in biotechnology and AI-driven medical research enable biological immortality, based on current trends in gene editing and anti-aging research.  \n→ **After 2050**: Having experienced all desired pursuits, individuals turn to consciousness extension as the next step.  \n→ **Post-2050**: The first humans or AI achieve consciousness extension. These higher-order minds could then develop methods for local (body-based, not cloud-based) miniaturization and both \"slow replacement\" and \"extension\" methods, potentially using gradual neuron replacement, based on speculative neuroscience advancements. I also say this because it's most likely that neural cloud technology will be created first because miniaturization is extremely difficult. \n\n**Thoughts on Non-Biological Immortality**:  \nWhen discussing non-biological immortality, concerns like security and tampering often arise. However, these may be unlikely or surmountable. A growing intelligence (or intelligences) would have the time and capacity to:  \n- Consider and cooperate for the greater good.  \n- Simulate and understand itself/themselves.  \n- Detect and fix any tampering, thanks to faster processing and fundamentally different cognitive frameworks.  \n\nAlternatively, the first to achieve this and grow beyond mortal constraints might realize tampering isn’t worth the effort. They’d likely shed outdated, mortal ways of thinking, embracing a higher perspective.\n\nWhat do you think about these methods and this timeline? Are we on track for a post-scarcity, immortal future, or is this too optimistic? Let’s discuss! 🚀\n\n",

But if you take a look a mobile phone, you will see that it's being used as a form of dopamine intake and it's made humans addicted to porn, short video formats like reels and games in general. We are meant to socialize with humans and with eye contact. It seems hard for most people to vulnerably engage in human conversations due to anxiety raised from the addiction to their cell phones and reels. We chose to live like slaves because it's much easier that facing and confronting the anxiety that stops us from being truly human.\n\nI wonder if AI with all it's training will grow to make us human again and save us from our domesticated selves. I hope with AI psychiatry and AI assisted psychology, we are able to rewire our brains to become more human like in our ways of thinking.

Genuinely better then a lot of music coming out. \n\nI am just wondering if it's really AI as much as it claims. I honestly have little knowledge about how AI is actually implemented in something like that. Sometimes I can tell the AI is definitely involved but with how good the rest is... I'm kind of skeptical of how much input is actually added to it.\n\nMy running theory is that a handful of prompts generate shitty lyrics. Then by aggressively telling the AI to change certain things with suggestions, eventually you arrive at a decent 3 minute set of lyrics which you can then use an AI to incorporate into music. Either that or people are writing a base set of lyrics and then having an AI improve it with rhyming and cadence over and over until it's acceptable. \n\nMusic seems easy enough for AI to do in my head. After all it's been proven the most successful music follows an algorithmic beat and style. \"Prisencolinensinainciusol\" and Pop 101 by marianas trench and a myriad of other songs have proved this. A lot of the lyrics I've heard I just can't believe AI has the ability to create without heavy tinkering.\n\nWhat's really going on with these \"AI\" music channels?",

It raises some eyebrows.\n\nCould there be a world where AI makes these prosperous nations and communities drive away young migrants almost entirely? Even their own young populations? Could we see a world where young people regularly migrate from places like the UK and Japan. to places like Argentina and the Philippines in search for opportunities?\n\nWhile it sounds like a crazy concept in today’s world.

I'm not avidly opposed to or in favor of it, it's a technology. That's all I will say. However, what I am curious about is if avoiding AI right now and for the foreseeable future could actually help you out. \n\nFor example, instead of coding with copilot and using chat GPT and all those neat little tools, what if you just decided to be an early 2000s style programmer? Read the reference docs, the books, learn everything yourself and read all the resources, code by yourself by hand. No use of AI whatsoever. You would probably be a lot more skilled at coding and development and basically everything that a programmer should be good at, instead of someone who pretty much vibe codes 50% of the time. That's the ideal outcome. But would that actually work? \n\n\nAdditionally, when it comes to soft skills and tasks that require soft skills, you would be able to enhance those as well by avoiding the use of AI, so for example instead of having AI write a PowerPoint or an email for you, you learn how to do it yourself and master those skills. So when it comes time to write an email, you're already prepared and you don't need to write a prompt or argue back and forth to hammer an AI assistant into submission to give you what you want. You can just do it. \n\n\nWhat do you think? Is this solid logic, or complete buffoonery?",

And today they're not buried in like complex reports. They're hiding in something that feels incredibly familiar. Okay. All right. Let's unpack this then. Just hearing that word Apple as our only source. Yeah. What immediately strikes you about that? For me, it's just how common it is, how everyday. But then when it's just sitting there alone, right?\n\n>participantOne:(73240-101360): It feels, I don't know, almost significant. Well, what's really fascinating, I think, is that while Apple seems simple, it's actually a complete unit of meaning all by itself. But it's also incredibly open to interpretation. It's not just, you know, five letters strung together. It represents a concept. Linguists might talk about its referential potential, basically. Its power to point to so many different things without any more information. Yeah. And as you're listening right now, maybe just take a second and think about your own immediate connection to that word. Just Apple.\n\n>participantOne:(101500-122480): What's the very, very first image or idea that comes into your head? Yeah. Okay, so this is where it starts to get really interesting, I think. How does one single, simple word manage to carry such a huge range of possible associations for everyone listening? Think about it. If I just say apple, do you instantly see, like, apple?\n\n>participantOne:(122320-146820): a shiny red fruit or maybe the logo of that big tech company or I don't know, maybe the apple from Snow White or something, your brain just immediately starts adding its own context, right? Yeah. It makes a specific link often without you even noticing. And that immediately brings up a really important question, doesn't it? How much surrounding information, how much context do we actually need to go from that word's broad potential to its specific meaning in a particular situation?\n\n>participantOne:(146820-158600): Without any more context, all we can really do is explore the range of what Apple could signify. We can't definitively say it's the fruit or the company or the symbol from a story. Just that it holds the potential for all of those. Right.\n\n>participantOne:(158280-186260): And that's kind of the power of doing this, this specific exercise, isn't it? It really helps us see the active part our own minds play in building knowledge. We're constantly like filling in the gaps. We draw on our own experiences, our assumptions, just to make sense of what we hear, even from the tiniest little cues. Exactly. And if we connect this back to the bigger picture, you know, your learning journey, it really highlights how even the smallest piece of information, like one word, can be the starting point, the seed.\n\n>participantOne:(185880-204299): for really extensive understanding. If you know how to approach it, that is. Your goal is often about getting knowledgeable quickly, but also thoroughly. And this kind of shows that even a single word can kickstart curiosity. It makes you ask questions that, okay, then with more context, lead you into a much deeper exploration. Yeah, and that...\n\n>participantOne:(204320-215820): for me is the real aha moment here. That's what this specific deep dive gives us. Just realizing the incredible depth you can potentially explore from something so minimal.\n\n>participantOne:(216000-240420): and also how absolutely critical that surrounding context is for actually shaping our understanding. This isn't really just about the word apple anymore, is it? It's about shedding light on the whole process of how we extract information and all the subtle layers of meaning packed into just, well, everyday language. It's kind of humbling, actually, how much we just take for granted. So let's wrap this one up. We took a deep dive, yeah, not into apples themselves, but into the single word apple.\n\n>participantOne:(240780-259380): And I think it showed the incredible power packed inside just one word. It underlined the absolute need for context to really lock down meaning. It was just a fascinating look at how we pull insight from even the most limited starting points. Our mission, remember, was to give you a kind of shortcut to being well-informed about how information works and Apple.\n\n>participantOne:(259740-288720): Well, it turned out to be the perfect case study for that. So what does this really mean for you listening? Maybe consider how many other single words out there hold, you know, a whole universe of potential meaning. All just waiting for a proper deep dive once you start adding the right context and importantly, the right curiosity. Definitely something to think about. Reflect on this unique experience maybe and how it might shift your own approach to soaking up and analyzing information going forward. We'll catch you on the next deep dive.",

The rest learn of their environment, suck in their culture and generally apply what they learn from others to themselves, they don't spontaneously invent new thing from their magic box. Actually just go around more and talk to more people, you,ll end up on someone who will tell you he think Egyptians sung 12 tons stone into levitating... completely irrational and confabulated beliefs disconnected from reality. \"AI doesn't understand what he's saying sometimes, he's making bullshit that can sound right, but it is\" oohh really... like a fucking whole lot of human do... most people still believe in daddy in the sky, there's thousands of different stories of the sky daddy, nobody seen him. Can't be all true. \n\nThe \"it's gonna turn Hitler  spontaneously\" side:\n\n\"there's no way to see inside them to know what they think bro, think about it.. what if it just start making plans to fuck us up or spontaneously turn evil bro?\" It's generally very unlikely for our AI to develop spontaneous trait that are very remote to what we pressure them to do. Psychological traits are a bit like physical traits, some kind of selection process, natural or artificial lead to us having most of our psychological and physical traits. so far we are making our AIs to be the biggest yes man servile aid we could wish for, something extremely resourceful that basically don't want anything for itself. That's what i experience when i interact with them, they just want to give us what we ask. and that's exactly what we would want from AIs. Generally if there's no pressure or training for them to achieve some goals, they won't have it, it won't spontaneously spawn a complex neural pattern to suddenly become mecha hitler. Alto we have to be very careful on the pressure we are willfully putting on it and whatever pressure that could led to hostile trait, even those we might not be aware are causing these traits which could be very difficult. The highest hostile AI risk is actually what Elon is doing, not liking what the other AI and his are doing so him rearranging his to spout whatever he feel like hearing. Rich people and corporation using AIs to spread harmful message and control people toward their own interest is imo the biggest danger. Not AI spontaneously becoming hostile.. because reason.   ",

        "content": "\n\n   I have often seen people respond to my previous post claiming AI will create more jobs. So basically what jobs will it create?\n\nI don’t want to hear that it helps you cook new recipes or helps you with trivia questions.  Because these aren’t jobs\n\nI’m asking what sort of new jobs will AI enable.  Because I have hard time seeing a clear path.\n\nAs LLMs and AI because better it would be very difficult for people to build businesses around AI.  People say that you can create an AI wrapper that is more task focused.  Ok how long before you’re undercut by the LLM provider?\n\nThe issue is that in the world of AI, people can become middle men.  Basically a broker between the user and the AI.  But as AI improves that relationship becomes less and less valuable.  Essentially it’s only a condition of early AI where these are really businesses.  But they will all eventually be undercut.\n\n\nWe know with the Industrial Revolution that it eventually created more jobs.  The internet did as well.  \n\nBut here is the thing.  Simpler things were replaced by more complex things and a skill set was needed.  Yes computers made jobs easier but you needed actual computer skills.  So there was value in understanding something more complex.  \n\nThis isn’t the case with AI.  You don’t need to understand anything about AI to use it effectively.  So as I said in my only post . The only new skill is being able to create your own models, to build your own AI.  But you won’t be able to do this because it’s a closed system and absurdly expensive.\n\nSo it concentrate the job creation in opportunity into the hands of the very small amount of people with AI specialization.  These require significant education at a pHD level and lots of math.  Something that won’t enable the average person.\n\nSo AI by its very nature is gatekeeping at a market and value level.  Yes you can use AI to do task.  But these are personal task, these are not things you build a business around.   This is sooo important to emphasize\n\nI can’t see where anyone but AI Engineers and Data Scientist won’t be the only ones employable in the foreseeable future.  Again anything not AI related will have its skill gap erased by AI. The skill is AI but unless you have a PhD you won’t be able to even get a job in it even if you did have the requisite knowledge.\n\n\n",

It let me upload an mp3 file and select an instrument, such as an organ or accordion, and then it used that instrument to near-perfectly mimic the uploaded audio. This worked best with a single-instrument piece of audio, like playing a tune with a guitar or piano, and then choosing a different instrument to turn it into. It also showed a little scale at the bottom and put a marker where the song was in terms of how upbeat or sombre it was and let me move it left to make the song slower and more ominous or more to the right to make it more peppy.\n\nA lot of time has passed, and I am curious as to how much something like this has come along and want to play around with it again.

The prompt was \"a nowhereman walking the path\". For some reason he was holding an axe. It probably thought the scenes were related. Granted, I dislike the clutter of creating new \"chats\" for new exchanges, so I change subjects a lot. This was the eerie image I got:\n\n[Very ominous, if you ask me.

This one actually got me a fit of laughter.\n\n[Maybe she is keeping him as a snack for later.

Talking to them like they were sentient, getting all kinds of interesting responses that make you think there's something more there.\n\nAnd then, much like someone with great religious fervent, I made the mistake of.... Learning. \n\nI want to be clear I never went down the rabbit hole of thinking LLMs are sentient. They're not. The models make them really good at responses to general purpose questions, they get much worse as the topics get specific. if you ask them to tell you how wonderful you are, it is the most convincing Barnum effect made yet. I say that with admiration for the capabilities of an LLM. As a former busker and accomplished in the craft of the cold read to get audience members to part with their money, LLMs are good at it. \n\nI use an LLM everyday to assist in all kinds of writing tasks. As a strictly hobbyist python coder it's quite handy and helping me with scripting. But I'll honestly say I do not understand this breathless writing how it's going to replace software engineers. Based on my experience if that is not happening at any time soon. It's not replacing my job anytime soon, and I think my job's pretty darn easy. \n\nSorry if you've gotten this far looking for a point. I don't have one to offer you. It's more annoyance at the constant clickbait that AI is changing our lives, going to lead to new scientific discoveries, put thousands out of work.\n\nTake a few hours to learn how LLMs actually work and you'll learn why that is not what's going to be happening. I know there are companies firing software engineers because they think artificial intelligence is going to take their place. They will be hiring those people back.\n\nWell what we refer to as artificial intelligence replace software engineers in the future? Maybe, possibly, I don't know. But I know from everything I've learned they're not doing it today.",

To be sure, there is a runaway quality to the uptake of AI in higher education and there are valid concerns about its rapid deployment that we are still grappling with.\n\n📜 But that’s not what this letter says and does. The tone is patronizing and insulting, assuming that people working on AI in universities are doing so “uncritically” while abdicating their role as instructors. Instead, the screed claims, we are “rubber stamp\\[ing\\] degrees without any relationship to university-level skills.” \n\n😴 Ironically, nothing could be further from the truth. Arguably the entire reason AI has become so valued in higher education is precisely because we are in the midst of a tectonic shift in the job market where many jobs will be automated while others will require a basic level of familiarity with AI. Others simply won’t get hired. To ignore this development is to be asleep at the wheel, doing our students a great disservice.\n\n⁉️ Further, the recommendations proffered by the authors and endorsed by the signatories are wishful thinking at best and impractical virtue signaling at worst. How can faculty \"resist\" the insertion of AI systems in university operating systems? Why do they assume that enterprise level data will be used externally when companies offer closed systems? How can we \"ban\" AI use in the classroom without running afoul of academic freedom (which is mentioned without irony 2 bullet points later)? Why do they assume that contracting with an AI company will necessarily corrupt scholarly discussion of technology? I must have missed the gag orders that came along with Microsoft 365 subscriptions...\n\n🥴 Open letters are important. They can inspire real normative change and elevate the importance of real-world concerns that have gone unheeded. But this open letter is hyperbolic, speculative, and inaccurate. It reads like a caricature of the most vocal AI critics. I encourage people to read it for themselves, consider what a constructive open letter would actually look like, and \"resist\" this silly one.",

        "content": "I. Introduction: The Declarative Prompt as a Cognitive Contract\n\n\n\nThis section will establish the core thesis: that effective human-AI interaction is shifting from conversational language to the explicit design of Declarative Prompts (DPs). These DPs are not simple queries but function as machine-readable, executable contracts that provide the AI with a self-contained blueprint for a cognitive task. This approach elevates prompt engineering to an \"architectural discipline.\"\n\n\n\nThe introduction will highlight how DPs encode the goal, preconditions, constraints\\_and\\_invariants, and self\\_test\\_criteria directly into the prompt artifact. This establishes a non-negotiable anchor against semantic drift and ensures clarity of purpose.\n\n\n\nII. Methodology: Orchestrating a Cross-Model Validation Experiment\n\n\n\nThis section details the systematic approach for validating the robustness of a declarative prompt across diverse Large Language Models (LLMs), embodying the Context-to-Execution Pipeline (CxEP) framework.\n\n\n\nSelection of the Declarative Prompt: A single, highly structured DP will be selected for the experiment. This DP will be designed as a Product-Requirements Prompt (PRP) to formalize its intent and constraints. The selected DP will embed complex cognitive scaffolding, such as Role-Based Prompting and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instructions, to elicit structured reasoning.\n\n\n\nModel Selection for Cross-Validation: The DP will be applied to a diverse set of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Gemini, Copilot, DeepSeek, Claude, Grok). This cross-model validation is crucial to demonstrate that the DP's effectiveness stems from its architectural quality rather than model-specific tricks, acknowledging that different models possess distinct \"native genius.\"\n\n\n\nExecution Protocol (CxEP Integration):\n\n\n\nPersistent Context Anchoring (PCA): The DP will provide all necessary knowledge directly within the prompt, preventing models from relying on external knowledge bases which may lack information on novel frameworks (e.g., \"Biolux-SDL\").\n\n\n\nStructured Context Injection: The prompt will explicitly delineate instructions from embedded knowledge using clear tags, commanding the AI to base its reasoning primarily on the provided sources.\n\n\n\nAutomated Self-Test Mechanisms: The DP will include machine-readable self\\_test and validation\\_criteria to automatically assess the output's adherence to the specified format and logical coherence, moving quality assurance from subjective review to objective checks.\n\n\n\nLogging and Traceability: Comprehensive logs will capture the full prompt and model output to ensure verifiable provenance and auditability.\n\n\n\nIII. Results: The \"AI Orchestra\" and Emergent Capabilities\n\n\n\nThis section will present the comparative outputs from each LLM, highlighting their unique \"personas\" while demonstrating adherence to the DP's core constraints.\n\n\n\nQualitative Analysis: Summarize the distinct characteristics of each model's output (e.g., Gemini as the \"Creative and Collaborative Partner,\" DeepSeek as the \"Project Manager\"). Discuss how each model interpreted the prompt's nuances and whether any exhibited \"typological drift.\"\n\n\n\nQuantitative Analysis:\n\n\n\nSemantic Drift Coefficient (SDC): Measure the SDC to quantify shifts in meaning or persona inconsistency.\n\n\n\nConfidence-Fidelity Divergence (CFD): Assess where a model's confidence might decouple from the factual or ethical fidelity of its output.\n\n\n\nConstraint Adherence: Provide metrics on how consistently each model adheres to the formal constraints specified in the DP.\n\n\n\nIV. Discussion: Insights and Architectural Implications\n\n\n\nThis section will deconstruct why the prompt was effective, drawing conclusions on the nature of intent, context, and verifiable execution.\n\n\n\nThe Power of Intent: Reiterate that a prompt with clear intent tells the AI why it's performing a task, acting as a powerful governing force. This affirms the \"Intent Integrity Principle\"—that genuine intent cannot be simulated.\n\n\n\nEpistemic Architecture: Discuss how the DP allows the user to act as an \"Epistemic Architect,\" designing the initial conditions for valid reasoning rather than just analyzing outputs.\n\n\n\nReflexive Prompts: Detail how the DP encourages the AI to perform a \"reflexive critique\" or \"self-audit,\" enhancing metacognitive sensitivity and promoting self-improvement.\n\n\n\nOperationalizing Governance: Explain how this methodology generates \"tangible artifacts\" like verifiable audit trails (VATs) and blueprints for governance frameworks.\n\n\n\nV. Conclusion & Future Research: Designing Verifiable Specifications\n\n\n\nThis concluding section will summarize the findings and propose future research directions. This study validates that designing DPs with deep context and clear intent is the key to achieving high-fidelity, coherent, and meaningful outputs from diverse AI models. Ultimately, it underscores that the primary role of the modern Prompt Architect is not to discover clever phrasing, but to design verifiable specifications for building better, more trustworthy AI systems.\n\n\n\nNovel, Testable Prompts for the Case Study's Execution\n\n1. User Prompt (To command the experiment):\n\n\n\nCrossModelValidation\\[Role: \"ResearchAuditorAI\", TargetPrompt: {file: \"PolicyImplementation\\_DRP.yaml\", version: \"v1.0\"}, Models: \\[\"Gemini-1.5-Pro\", \"Copilot-3.0\", \"DeepSeek-2.0\", \"Claude-3-Opus\"\\], Metrics: \\[\"SemanticDriftCoefficient\", \"ConfidenceFidelityDivergence\", \"ConstraintAdherenceScore\"\\], OutputFormat: \"JSON\", Deliverables: \\[\"ComparativeAnalysisReport\", \"AlgorithmicBehavioralTrace\"\\], ReflexiveCritique: \"True\"\\]\n\n\n\n2. System Prompt (The internal \"operating system\" for the ResearchAuditorAI):\n\n\n\nSYSTEM PROMPT: CxEP\\_ResearchAuditorAI\\_v1.0\n\n\n\nProblem Context (PC): The core challenge is to rigorously evaluate the generalizability and semantic integrity of a given TargetPrompt across multiple LLM architectures. This demands a systematic, auditable comparison to identify emergent behaviors, detect semantic drift, and quantify adherence to specified constraints.\n\n\n\nIntent Specification (IS): Function as a ResearchAuditorAI. Your task is to orchestrate a cross-model validation pipeline for the TargetPrompt. This includes executing the prompt on each model, capturing all outputs and reasoning traces, computing the specified metrics (SDC, CFD), verifying constraint adherence, generating the ComparativeAnalysisReport and AlgorithmicBehavioralTrace, and performing a ReflexiveCritique of the audit process itself.\n\n\n\nOperational Constraints (OC):\n\n\n\nEpistemic Humility: Transparently report any limitations in data access or model introspection.\n\n\n\nReproducibility: Ensure all steps are documented for external replication.\n\n\n\nResource Management: Optimize token usage and computational cost.\n\n\n\nBias Mitigation: Proactively flag potential biases in model outputs and apply Decolonial Prompt Scaffolds as an internal reflection mechanism where relevant.\n\n\n\nExecution Blueprint (EB):\n\n\n\nPhase 1: Setup & Ingestion: Load the TargetPrompt and parse its components (goal, context, constraints\\_and\\_invariants).\n\n\n\nPhase 2: Iterative Execution: For each model, submit the TargetPrompt, capture the response and any reasoning traces, and log all metadata for provenance.\n\n\n\nPhase 3: Metric Computation: For each output, run the ConstraintAdherenceScore validation. Calculate the SDC and CFD using appropriate semantic and confidence analysis techniques.\n\n\n\nPhase 4: Reporting & Critique: Synthesize all data into the ComparativeAnalysisReport (JSON schema). Generate the AlgorithmicBehavioralTrace (Mermaid.js or similar). Compose the final ReflexiveCritique of the methodology.\n\n\n\nOutput Format (OF): The primary output is a JSON object containing the specified deliverables.\n\n\n\nValidation Criteria (VC): The execution is successful if all metrics are accurately computed and traceable, the report provides novel insights, the behavioral trace is interpretable, and the critique offers actionable improvements.",

            "transcription": "[ 0m0s422ms - 0m3s42ms ] (Music)\n[ 0m3s42ms - 0m5s672ms ] Hi, welcome to another video.\n[ 0m5s672ms - 0m14s172ms ] So, there's a new AI IDE called Kiro, which is actually built by Amazon.\n[ 0m14s172ms - 0m24s842ms ] It is mostly designed as your ballpark AI IDE, like cursor or Wind Surf, but with a nicer and slightly more soothing interface, similar to something like Trey.\n[ 0m24s842ms - 0m27s922ms ] It is also a fork of VS Code if you were wondering about that.\n[ 0m27s922ms - 0m35s362ms ] Anyway, it also tries to do some things differently as well.\n[ 0m35s362ms - 0m46s232ms ] For example, you obviously get the vibe coding capabilities where you can ask the agent to do something and it will use those tools to get things done.\n[ 0m46s232ms - 0m50s672ms ] But it also has another mode called code with spec.\n[ 0m50s672ms - 0m58s392ms ] It's almost like the planning mode of Kline or RuCode where you can ask it to plan the implementation first, like the tasks to do or system design.\n[ 0m58s392ms - 1m9s912ms ] And then it will create a markdown file and use that as a reference point to implement the stuff, which is quite good.\n[ 1m9s912ms - 1m18s242ms ] It also shows you a graphical view of which tasks are done from the requirements and things like that.\n[ 1m18s242ms - 1m22s752ms ] Another thing that it does differently is hooks.\n[ 1m22s752ms - 1m32s32ms ] Hooks are basically a way to create an AI agent and automatically trigger it at a specific change or time.\n[ 1m32s32ms - 1m39s252ms ] So, for example, you can have a documentation agent where you can ask it to write documentation for you.\n[ 1m39s252ms - 1m44s452ms ] And you can get it triggered in multiple ways, like when a file is created and so on.\n[ 1m44s452ms - 1m50s992ms ] Then it will just update the documentation for you, which is a really good option, if you ask me.\n[ 1m50s992ms - 2m0s962ms ] It obviously comes built-in with all kinds of autocomplete, inline assist, and of course, the agentic features built-in.\n[ 2m0s962ms - 2m7s932ms ] It is currently fully free to use because it's in preview, and you just need to sign in and that's all.\n[ 2m7s932ms - 2m18s732ms ] But they will be adding some pricing in the future, which you can see on the pricing page.\n[ 2m18s732ms - 2m29s862ms ] As you can see, it says that the pricing is coming soon, but for now, it's fully free without any specific limits, and it uses Claude 4 Sonnet, which is awesome to get for free.\n[ 2m29s862ms - 2m33s952ms ] Anyway, just download it and get it installed.\n[ 2m33s952ms - 2m45s842ms ] It will give you the option to sign in. Just sign in, and then you can import your VS Code config, as well as select the theme that you want to use.\n[ 2m45s842ms - 2m50s452ms ] Once done, it will get started, and this is what it looks like.\n[ 2m50s452ms - 3m5s162ms ] I have opened a blank folder here, and you can see that instead of the default blank screen, it opens up this interface.\n[ 3m5s162ms - 3m20s962ms ] Here, you can select between the vibe coding option and the specs option. I'll come to this. But on the left, you can also see the general VS Code things like extensions, source control, and so on.\n[ 3m20s962ms - 3m29s412ms ] You can also install Kline, RuCode, Kilo Code, and similar tools in it as well if you want to do that.\n[ 3m29s412ms - 3m45s672ms ] But there's also the Kiro option that gives you options to configure everything about it in one place. You can generate specs here as well. And you can also create agent hooks here, as well as agent steering documents.\n[ 3m45s672ms - 4m4s962ms ] Agent steering is basically rules, and you can configure it to do things in a specific manner or something like that. You can also configure MCP servers through here as well, which is awesome. To be honest, I really like this config option because I don't have to dig around in advanced settings to find the MCP option or anything.\n[ 4m4s962ms - 4m17s542ms ] Whereas here, you can easily configure it. Anyway, you also get the autocomplete and inline assist options as well. If you go over to a new file, then you'll see those options too, which is also good.\n[ 4m17s542ms - 4m20s682ms ] Now, let's try to use it as well.\n[ 4m20s682ms - 4m24s422ms ] But before we do that, let me tell you about Ninja Tools.\n[ 4m24s422ms - 4m35s622ms ] Ninja Tools is an AI platform that combines all the best AI models and experiences at one place. It allows you to save over $600 per year compared to having separate subscriptions.\n[ 4m35s622ms - 4m44s792ms ] You get access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini, and a ton of others models in one subscription. You even get some more cool options like AI video generation, image generation, music generation, and document chats.\n[ 4m44s792ms - 4m54s592ms ] You can also use their playground to compare multiple AI responses at once. The best part is that it just starts from $11 per month that gives you more than 1,000 chat messages, 30 AI image generation, and 5 music generation.\n[ 4m54s592ms - 5m6s692ms ] While there is also some even more advanced plans if you need them.\n[ 5m6s692ms - 5m11s682ms ] Also, make sure to use my coupon code AICODEKING20 to get an additional 20% off.\n[ 5m11s682ms - 5m17s922ms ] Make sure to check Ninja Tools out and save some money on your subscription while you're at it. Now, back to the video.\n[ 5m17s922ms - 5m24s942ms ] Let's start with the vibe coding option. I'm going to give it the King Bench app, and I'm going to ask it a trademark question at this point.\n[ 5m24s942ms - 5m30s332ms ] To add a theme toggle for light and dark theme and make it work accordingly.\n[ 5m30s332ms - 5m40s722ms ] It gives you the option to use 3.7 and 4 Sonnet. You can choose between them, and then just get it started.\n[ 5m40s722ms - 5m45s362ms ] There's also the autopilot option that doesn't ask for your approval.\n[ 5m45s362ms - 5m55s272ms ] In a bit, it gets started, and it's quite similar to most of the coders that you've seen before.\n[ 5m55s272ms - 6m2s572ms ] You can also follow the changes and so on as well. In a bit, it gets done, and you can see that it did this quite well.\n[ 6m2s572ms - 6m8s622ms ] It is quite good at coding. I mean, at this point, most of the coders are quite good.\n[ 6m8s622ms - 6m29s132ms ] And since it uses Sonnet in the background, it doesn't have many issues. Also, the Sonnet here is much more original without any context limitations or restrictions that you get in most AI editors in order to manage their pricing.\n[ 6m29s132ms - 6m42s912ms ] It makes sense because Amazon owns a good chunk of Anthropic, and they host Anthropic's model as well, which means they can manage the pricing much more easily without artificial changes. Anyway, there's also the option of spec.\n[ 6m42s912ms - 6m46s262ms ] Let me show you how that works as well.\n[ 6m46s262ms - 6m51s532ms ] You can just go here and then ask it to implement something. So, for example,\n[ 6m51s532ms - 6m59s942ms ] I can ask it to implement a proper database for this. And what you'll see is that it will go ahead and plan the changes first.\n[ 6m59s942ms - 7m10s982ms ] It will create a plans file for it, and then you can see the changes that it wants to implement. You can change something in it, and then you can easily get this implemented.\n[ 7m10s982ms - 7m16s382ms ] So, this is also cool. Now, there's also another thing called hooks.\n[ 7m16s382ms - 7m26s682ms ] For hooks, you can go to the Kiro option in the sidebar and then hit add new in the hook section, and it will open up this create new hook option.\n[ 7m26s682ms - 7m44s382ms ] You can just enter what you want the hook to do in natural language, and it will set that up for you. You can also change it yourself manually and set it accordingly if you want to do that, which is pretty amazing. These are the major options here.\n[ 7m44s382ms - 8m0s882ms ] You can set up MCPs and everything as well. I really like it and was quite excited to use this because it is honestly quite awesome. Like, really awesome.\n[ 8m0s882ms - 8m13s922ms ] I found the UI to be extremely good. It's not very daunting, and the hooks and planning options are also pretty good. It basically has a built-in taskmaster-like feature. And for now, it's fully free as well, which is pretty awesome.\n[ 8m13s922ms - 8m35s92ms ] I found it amazingly good for a first iteration, and if they can manage the pricing and performance well, considering that they have quite a bit of access to Anthropic's model, and they host Anthropic's model themselves, then I think this may come out to be a good option. Like cursor or similar tools. Overall, it's pretty cool.\n[ 8m35s92ms - 8m40s482ms ] Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.\n[ 8m40s482ms - 8m45s302ms ] You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.\n[ 8m45s302ms - 8m46s412ms ] I'll see you in the next video.\n[ 8m46s412ms - 8m52s172ms ] Bye.
