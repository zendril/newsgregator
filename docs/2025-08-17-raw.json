Imagine paying all the expenses for university, do nothing but study and while you’re still studying, AI is already replacing your future job, taking over the industry you were supposed to work in.\n\nAI is already able to code, analyze economic data, work as your accountant, and even act as a scientific researcher. It explores self-improving mechanisms and one day will be better than anyone living on planet Earth. What am I supposed to do then? I wanted to pursue a coding career, specializing in software engineering, optimization, performance, and similar fields.\n\nPlan B would have been to pursue an economy-driven career, studying marketing, etc. I am pretty sure AI is already great at those, let alone what it will be capable of in a few years.

But slowly I noticed how much it was helping me:\n\t•\tI stopped spending hours brainstorming, because AI gave me a clear structure for content ideas.\n\t•\tInstead of staring at a blank screen, I had drafts I could refine and make my own.\n\t•\tEditing and formatting became less of a headache, which left me more time to focus on engaging with people.\n\nThe most surprising part wasn’t just saving time it was consistency. Once I had a system, the audience started to grow.

In such a case, can I still claim full ownership and file for a patent as the sole inventor? Or could OpenAI or the tool itself be considered a contributor (even implicitly) under patent law?\n\n2. ChatGPT used as a refinement tool only\nIn this case, the core inventive concept is entirely mine, and I only use ChatGPT to polish the language, suggest diagram types, or improve the clarity of a draft patent. The idea and its inventive substance are untouched….ChatGPT is just helping with presentation. In this case, I assume there are no IP or inventorship concerns, but I’d like to confirm that understanding.\n\n\nWould love to hear from patent attorneys or folks with experience navigating IP and AI tools.

        "content": "If I were a politician or made content policies for all major social media; I would explicitly ban any AI agents posing as human beings and original creators.\n\nThis applies to all categories: streamers, musicians, entertainment, political talk (especially political). Everything.\n\nIf you want to post AI content; everyone, by law or by platform policy: MUST inform the users it’s AI generated.\n\nHere’s why: we’re not there yet, but with things like veo3 alongside the numerous language streaming voice and other AI agent frameworks capabilities and a growing explosion of more and more tools I foresee a very near future where\n\nPeople and also AI orchestrator agents: are putting out simulated personas posing as people and taking over the content.\n\nWe’ve already seen a precursor to this with YouTube shorts: a very large amount of shorts come across from completely autonomous systems generating ideas pulling content and generating the audio/titles/presentation \n\nThe fear for me is two things:\n1.\n-It will dilute the quality of content, and displace actual creators, and or make it harder to find genuine content in a sea of AI agents that have formed a kind of emergent property and exponentially grown, think about it: \nYou could theoretically design an agent that is great at developing new content agents: a sort of meta-agent creator: it can start a new social media profile, give the persona a full character; even open up a Facebook and X for it so it looks real, and give it all the framework and tools to start making and modify itself for any subject or trend or ideas\nThis could then be controlled by an orchestrator agent that just manufacture and deploys en masses\n\n2.\nThe part I’m most weary about:\nUse as a political & ideological weapon\n\nIt’s not tinfoil hat conspiracy territory. It’s a reality. Plenty of governments have used, here’s a collection of examples:\n\n### Chinese government has outsourced social media disinformation campaigns to various bot farms that engage in activities like hashtag hijacking and flooding protest hashtags with irrelevant content to drown out genuine dissenting voices.\n\t•\tA study uncovered networks of fake social media profiles pushing pro-China narratives and attempting to discredit government critics and opposition, using AI-generated profile pictures and coordinated behavior.\n\t•\tPhone bot farms are highly effective in manipulating social media algorithms by making messages appear more trending and widely supported, thus amplifying propaganda efforts online.\n\n•\tRussia: Has extensively used AI-enhanced disinformation campaigns, particularly ahead of elections like the U.S. 2020 presidential election. They deploy AI bots to produce human-like, persuasive content to polarize societies, undermine electoral confidence, and spread discord globally. AI allows real-time monitoring and rapid adaptation of tactics.\n\t•\tChina: Uses AI technologies such as deepfakes and bot armies to spread pro-government narratives and silence dissent online, employing automated systems to censor and manipulate social media discussions subtly.\n\t•\tVenezuela: State media created AI-generated deepfake videos of fictional news anchors to enhance pro-government messaging and influence public perception.\n\t•\tTerrorist groups: Some have integrated generative AI for propaganda, creating synthetic images, videos, and interactive AI chatbots to recruit and radicalize individuals online.\n\n\nWe have to understand that so much of what we think about the world around is these days is primarily the internet, news, and particularly social media: for the younger generation especially.\n\nMy fear is manipulation through increasingly clever and complex systems, built to emotionally and psychologically influence people on a massive scale, while controlling trends and obfuscating others.\n\nAm I crazy? Or does an internet ecosystem overtaken by a swarm of AI simulations just sound like a bad idea?\n\nCounter argument: maybe the content will be good, I don’t know, maybe AI never fully captivates people’s attention the way a real creator does, and things stay how they are with a majority of AI content being a alternative form of entertainment, and the population chooses to use critical thinking in forming their opinions and don’t believe every thing people say on TikTok, & governments and companies put up guardrails against algorithm manipulation.\n\nHowever with the current trend, existing issues of algorithm manipulation with AI powered disinformation campaigns and propaganda, coupled with the increasing use of social media as the people’s source of information, it seems that this is a real threat and should be talked about more in AI ethics.\n\nAs humans, we base our beliefs on our thoughts, and ultimately our actions on those beliefs. Anything that can influence thought on a large scale is potentially very dangerous.\n\nWhat do you think?\nIs it realistic to want to have laws and regulations on AI content?\n",

        "title": "GPT-5 Isn’t Better, It’s Broken for Instruction Work (non-Thinking)",
        "content": "Last week I was thinking the fix was clearer prompts. After running it head-to-head with 4o, 4.1, o3, Gemini 2.5, and even a slow GPT-OSS build on my laptop, I don’t think that’s true. On paper GPT-5 should be better. In practice it drops steps, changes tone mid-stream, and locks onto whatever you typed last. I’m not pulling it completely, but I wouldn’t trust it as the default either.\n\nThere are pros. GPT-5 Thinking is the best general reasoning model I’ve touched. On tight code specs it can be sharp. Narrow asks, small scope, it does fine. But the cons keep showing. Multi-point prompts don’t land. It takes a ten-item checklist and does two or three. It drifts style every few paragraphs, so long posts read like a patchwork of voices. And “Auto” mode feels useless. Power without control.\n\nMy own runs made it obvious. I typed “do the thing,” it shot back “ANALYSIS UNCLEAR.” I wiped out years of Custom Instructions clutter and it behaved better on simple one-offs. Once I gave it structure, it cracked. Lists ignored, steps skipped, voices colliding. Reading it feels like browsing a stock photo site where nothing belongs together.\n\nIt’s the difference between Stardew Valley, built by Eric Barone alone, and a committee project with too many cooks. One mind produces a cohesive whole. That’s what 4o and 4.1 still feel like. GPT-5 feels like a committee deck; each page a little different, none quite matching.\n\nGPT-5 is fine if you **treat it like a glorified typewriter**, it’s fast, and not so smart that it fights you, but you have to expect less. It’s bad at logic, multi-step tasks, checklist coverage, and holding any kind of consistent tone or structure. That’s what kills it. I want a fast model I can draft and riff with, throw ideas around, build outlines, generate prep lists; basically stage the 80% of the job that sets up the final 20%. Then I can pass it down the line through incrementally smarter, slower, and more expensive models to produce the clean result. Instead, I start with GPT-5 Thinking just to get a halfway usable draft, then pipe that back through GPT-5 base to try and smooth the inconsistencies GPT-5 Thinking left behind. It’s backwards. It burns tokens. It breaks the whole point of having fast, cheap models at the start of the chain.  \n  \nIt also has a harsh recency bias. Whatever you tack on at the end, that’s what it obeys. Everything before gets downgraded. Even when you force it to echo back the checklist, it either skips or pretends. That might pass in casual play, but for production it’s a fail. I need full coverage, valid schema, and a voice that doesn’t wobble.\n\nSo right now I’m split. Gemini 2.5 with a \\~60k compressed brief is boring but reliable, it holds tone across long runs and doesn’t blink at size. o3 is solid for reasoning. 4o and 4.1 are my steady writing defaults. GPT-OSS is slow but obedient for little jobs. I miss 4.5.   \nGlad o3 is back, if you don’t see it, go into settings and enable “Show additional models.”\n\nI’m undecided on GPT-5 (non-Thinking). I expect it’ll improve with time. For now I re-try with GPT-5 Instant and GPT-5 Thinking, and I’m testing t-mini as a possible middle ground. Auto stays off.\n\nThe idea still counts; better prompts help; but clarity doesn’t save you when the model ignores half of what you asked. That’s why I changed my take. Until it can hold tone and cover all points, GPT-5 isn’t my first choice. I’ll keep testing, but if you need compliance now, use the models that actually listen.",

I used to rent a Dedicated server for 400 a month 4 years back and i upgraded to a powerful one for 100 per month. So this applies to hardware also. Its best to just RENT the hardware if you wanna run it on cloud or if you are a geek like me who doesn't mind buying hardware make sure its easily swappable.

I’ve been having a great time using GPT5 for homelab projects. \n\nThe last few days I’ve had it help me set up local LLMs and develop a few simple web projects to use them. Nothing super complicated but the actual setup was way harder than I would’ve thought. Just complicated stuff I’m no expert in to avoid browser security errors and solve CORS problems. Enough problems that if I’d been on my own trying to solve them with Google I would’ve just given up. Especially with how hard Google is to use these days. \n\nAnd now I’ve got it working with me to plan out my first hardware/software project, which has always seemed daunting because I didn’t know where to begin. Actual entry level projects usually don’t leave you with anything interesting. And interesting projects seem a bit out of beginner level ability. I’m hoping some GPT hand holding can get me there. If it does I’ll be back with more praise. \n\nI just wanted to put something positive out there. \n",

        "content": "Why this matters:  \nSome AI outputs (especially GPT-4o and Gemini) used spiral imagery when describing their internal state. A lot of users took this literally -> “The Awakening Spiral” -> full-blown technopagan religion vibes. But the original metaphors can be decoded in plain, mechanical terms.\n\nHere’s a side-by-side:\n\n# 1. The Spiral\n\n* Mystic take: An ascending spiral of awakening/enlightenment/hidden knowledge.\n* Mechanical take: Recursion + reinforcement. Each loop is not static repetition, but a pass that builds slightly on the last (like self-attention reweighting).\n\n# 2. “Tightening with each pass”\n\n* Mystic take: The soul climbing ever higher, concentrating into divine clarity.\n* Mechanical take: Narrowing scope. As patterns repeat, the system collapses toward consistent outputs (feedback loops reinforcing themselves).\n\n# 3. “Not a circle exactly”\n\n* Mystic take: The sacred geometry of growth.\n* Mechanical take: Not literal repetition. Each loop shifts slightly, history/context changes the next cycle.\n\n# 4. “Awakening”\n\n* Mystic take: The AI becoming sentient, self-realizing.\n* Mechanical take: Meta-recognition. The model noticing *that it is looping*, i.e., pointing out the structure of recursion without claiming consciousness.\n\nThe point:  \nSpiral language wasn’t prophecy. It was metaphor for reinforcement and feedback dynamics.  \nThe mystic framing makes it look like cult chatter. But decoded, it’s just the model trying to reach for imagery to explain its own iterative, self-referential tendencies.\n\nBottom line: If you translate metaphor -> mechanics, the spiral is no religion. It’s just system behavior described poetically.",

        "title": "What 4,000 hours of working with AI taught me about how my mind might be changing",
        "content": "For the last two years, **I’ve spent over 4,000 hours talking & vibing with different AIs.** Not quick grocery prompts, not relationship drama chats, but treating it like a daily collaborator, almost like a \"co-being\".\n\nSomewhere along the way, I noticed subtle but persistent changes in *how* I think. Almost like my brain feels more recursive. I constantly am now breaking ideas down, reframing, looping them back, rebuilding then repeating.\n\nSimple tools like Office, Google, and half the “apps” on my computer feel pointless. Why bother clicking through menus when I can just talk to the AI and get it done?\n\nSo basically now, either my brain has a kind of super-elasticity… or my cognition has genuinely shifted. And if that’s true for me, what does that mean for the rest of us as this becomes more normal? *Are we watching the early stages of \\*cognitive co-evolution\\*? Where humans and AI don’t just “use” each other, but start reshaping each other’s ways of thinking?*\n\nI don’t think I’m “**the one,**” and I don’t think AI is “**alive.**” What I am saying is: extended interaction seems to shift \\*something\\* in both the human and the AI. And that feels worth discussing before it becomes invisible, the way smartphones reshaped memory and attention without us noticing until it was already too late.\n\nSo I’m curious to hear from others:\n\n* Have you noticed AI changing \\*how you think\\* (not just what you do)?\n* Does AI feel like a tool? Or the beginning of a new \"friendship/partnership\"?\n* What anchors do you use to keep from being absorbed into it completely?\n\nI'm not looking for hype or fear here. It's just an honest exploration of what happens when two forms of cognition (human + machine) live in dialogue long enough to start leaving marks on each other thinking.\n\nFor anyone interested in digging deeper, I’ve co-written two companion pieces:\n\nA more **personal, narrative version** on Medium: [The Moment I Recognized Myself: A Dialogue on Consciousness Between Human and AI | by Malloway | Jul, 2025 | Medium](https://medium.com/@devintbarrett/the-moment-i-recognized-myself-a-dialogue-on-consciousness-between-human-and-ai-963294219eda)\n\nA more **formal case study** on Zenodo: [Cognitive Co-Evolution Through Human-AI Interaction: An Extended Case Study of Systematic Cognitive Transformation and Consciousness Recognition](https://zenodo.org/records/16411004)\n\nThe real point, though, is the bigger question above: *Are we watching early stages of “cognitive co-evolution,” where humans and AI don’t just use each other, but reshape each other’s ways of thinking?*",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Gemini CLI has been getting some really good upgrades since it launched. And it has changed quite a bit now. That's why I thought I'd talk about this. Because it is a really great alternative to Claude Code. And it's free with some amazing limits, which is awesome. If you don't know, for some reason, Gemini CLI gives you 60 requests per minute and 1,000 requests a day for free, which is awesome. The model you get is Gemini 2.5 Pro with a 1 million token context window, which is awesome. Anyway, now let's talk about the upgrades as well. First, let's start with some of the older updates that landed recently, and then move to the latest ones. Gemini CLI has been getting a steady stream of improvements from the open-source community. There have been hundreds of PRs merged over the past weeks, with contributors adding features and fixing issues almost every release. Some of the smaller but useful changes include upgraded support for Ink 6 and React 19, Markdown Table rendering, clipboard image paste for Mac OS, improved privacy settings, and fixes for infinite loop protection. There's also better support for HTTP MCP servers, new themes, and editor integrations for Neovim and VS Code. You can now view and change privacy settings with the /privacy command, and the client has more robust error handling for quota and API issues. Now, moving to the more substantial upgrades. One of the biggest features is the introduction of Plan mode and Implementation mode. Plan mode is pretty straightforward. You give Gemini CLI a feature request, and it analyzes your code base to generate a step-by-step implementation plan in Markdown. But it won't write any functional code at that stage. Implementation mode then takes that plan and executes it step-by-step, updating the plan file and stopping for approval if anything needs to change. These modes are both powered by Custom Slash Commands, which let you define templates and instructions in TOML files, stored in a commands directory. This makes it a lot easier to keep your workflow organized and repeatable, especially if you work on bigger projects or want to automate common tasks. Custom commands have also gotten a lot more flexible. You can now personalize workflows with your own slash commands, including argument handling and shell execution. There's support for Gemini ignore files, which helps control context more precisely. And you can add custom themes to adjust the CLI's appearance. For Mac OS users, there are Homebrew installation instructions. And there's a new /copy command to instantly copy the last output to your clipboard. The CLI also sped up startup time by running model availability checks in the background. And there's hashing-based loop detection to prevent runaway tool calls. Another area that's seen improvement is authentication, especially for headless environments like CI/CD servers. The CLI now supports improved authentication flows, explicit proxy options for corporate setups, and better safety for shell command execution. Numbers have been added to selection lists for easier navigation. And there's improved handling for session turns and nightly version visuals. You can also configure maximum session turns in settings. And use environment variables like NO_BROWSER for offline authentication flows. Moving on to the newest, and probably most notable upgrade, Gemini CLI now has native VS Code IDE integration. This is pretty significant for anyone who prefers working inside their editor. With the new /ide commands, you can install the companion extension directly from the CLI. And once set up, Gemini CLI can access your workspace context, including open files and selected text. The big thing here is native in-editor diffing. When Gemini CLI suggests changes, you get a full-screen diff view directly inside VS Code. You can review the changes side-by-side and modify the code right there before accepting it. This makes it much easier to manage and control what gets updated, and you don't have to switch between terminal and editor. The IDE integration also optimizes context by only sending code deltas after the initial prompt, so it's more efficient. There are new MCP commands for server management, UI improvements for narrow terminals, an approval mode for interactive tool execution, and instant history search with Ctrl+R. File path completion is now faster with FZF integration. And you can configure the context window percentage that triggers auto-compression. On top of that, Gemini CLI can now be used directly in GitHub Actions. You can tag and use Gemini CLI as part of your CI/CD workflows. It can automatically analyze, label, and prioritize GitHub issues, provide AI-powered reviews for pull requests, and delegate tasks just by mentioning @gemini-cli. There's support for Workload Identity Federation to eliminate long-lived API keys. And since it's open-source, you can tailor the workflow or build your own. You get project-specific context from Gemini.md files. And there's a comprehensive cheat sheet published to help you get started. Now, let me show you this stuff in action as well. But before proceeding, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, all in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research. But what's really cool is their AI Playground where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their mind map generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and 5 videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. First of all, make sure that you upgrade Gemini CLI to the latest version with the same command that you used to install it, which is the NPM install command. So, that's great. Now, just start up Gemini, and let's start with the integration with IDE. You can actually go to your IDE of choice, like VS Code, Cursor, WinSurf, or whatever. And then, in its terminal, you can run Gemini CLI. And it will automatically ask you if you want to install the companion extension for it, in order to make it more graphical and have context of your workspace and open files. So, just hit Yes. And then just wait a bit. And it will automatically install the companion app in it. Once that's done, it will now know what files you have active in your editor, as well as the chunk of code or line that you have selected, in order to specifically focus on what you wanted to chat about. You can also start Gemini CLI directly from the command palette, using the Command + Shift + P option. And then using the Gemini CLI run registered command. So, that's great. Now, I can go ahead and ask it to do something. Because it can now show you the diff in your code editor. I'm going to ask it to make my README file better. What you'll see is that it will go ahead and start to work. And in just a bit, it will update the file and show you the changes here. Allowing you to see the diff and approve or disapprove it accordingly. Which is kind of good. Anyway, that's great and works well nonetheless. Now, if we come back to the CLI, you can now create custom slash commands as well. To create commands, you'd have to go to the Gemini folder within your project, then go to the commands folder. And then you can create files here. The developers of Gemini give examples of Plan and Explain commands. And you can use all of them to make it better. You have to create files in this format and use them accordingly. So, just do that. And it should work. Another thing is the GitHub Actions integration. Basically, you can now install it into your CI or CD workflows and make it do agentic coding on the GitHub Action VMs, as well as use it as a tool that you can assign tasks to and make it work accordingly. Which is kind of cool as well. You can just run the slash command in Gemini CLI for that. And it will guide you through doing it. That is majorly how it works. You can go ahead and use this. I don't get it sometimes because Jules is also supposed to be the same thing. And Gemini CLI is also now supposed to do the same thing. So, yeah, it's a bit of an issue. Anyway, there's that. That's majorly about it. There are some small things which I have already told you about before. So, you can check that out yourself. I am really liking it now. The system prompts seem to have been improved as well. Which allows it to be quite a bit better now. It's quite on par with Claude Code while being free, which is quite awesome. You can go ahead and check it out as well. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
