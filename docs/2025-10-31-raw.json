        "content": "On World of Warcraft, I have traditionally played on role-playing servers, for example a server called Moon guard. Overtime, it has gotten a lot of remarkably more toxic and aggressive. It used to be a safe, very inclusive place, but for the past 3 years it's been getting worse. We've seen cases of blatant harassment that have been reported, and to check to see if the person is actioned, we can add them to our friends list. They'll appear online if they are still in game. Well, a lot of these people don't get actioned or face any sort of penalty. It's very obvious because they keep saying the same racist terrible stuff that would literally get you banned permanently from Reddit for commenting any of it to another person....\n\n\nSo I asked on the blizzard customer service forums and asked a friend who works for Microsoft.... **The answer is yes**. They are using AI and machine learning heavily in their company right now, because like many companies, Microsoft and Blizzard are trying to mash AI as a thought partner and hard set requirement into their employees heads. So it's being integrated into everything, terribly. And that includes video games. Now instead of real people evaluating reports of harassment you probably have an AI model that barely even works. \n\n\nSome examples of the things that we have been reporting here on the role playing server in World of Warcraft are trans slurs, blatant harassment, racist remarks that are censored by the profanity filter for example the n-word. These are things that should be obvious ban immediately. In Old World of Warcraft like wrath of the lich King when you actually had game Masters that talk to people, you would get banned very fast for any of this sort of behavior. Now that they've implemented AI, no one ever gets banned and the harassment continues, so no one really wants to talk. ",

Protectors are imbedded with technology(CMR,& nano tech) to help them police the Corporations control over the populace. People just accept it. You do have outlier communities such as “The Gleaners” who live simplistically, and the big bad terrorist organization known as Liber8.\n\nThe show mirrors where we are heading as a one world government. It appears the China experiment has proven technological control over its citizens while adhering to the controllers of the CCP. The US has proven it has no problem with Corporations taking control and setting laws and policies to set them up as future controllers. \n\nThe AI we’re building will be the new middle class of the planet. It’s just one of the many reasons the middle class is being destroyed. Our Elite controllers will be at the top, AI will be middle class that will be the mechanism of controlling the lower class(everyone else). In order to move up in status you’ll be required to merge with the AI. You will be middle class but you’ll never be elite, no matter what technology you incorporate, that’ll be the illusion.",

The files haven’t been leaked yet, even with the majority of the public on the side of hoping for open transparency. Maybe a couple of very coincidental suicides to show you can be honest, but your life will be over, big brother treatment. Or after marking them a T-word for leaking, they can be arrested and thrown into prison, and Trump orders martial law after the public is, of course, outraged and rioting for the heads of government and billionaires. \n\nPeople are seriously not looking at the big picture. After an absurd amount of coincidental evidence, you can’t believe the obvious lies anymore. I highly doubt Epstein was trafficking thousands of underaged victims while rubbing shoulders with the top 0.000001% of the population, and everyone knew and did nothing with the victims that can be seen in photos and videos of these top percenters and only had tax reasons to hang out with him and the parties where minors, that are confirmed victims, weren’t touched by anyone of the people that are partying, drunk, and feel safe with the “privacy” they have to perform illegal activities. \n\nNope, the thousands of minors were only sexually assaulted by Epstein, and the confirmed pictures and videos where the minors are with them, they’re only there to serve the top percenters drinks and only ever did legal things. “\n\nI know most of what I feel about the files are borderline conspiracy and some theoretical. I’m not a know-it-all or fully believe even what I say, but thinking about plausible “what ifs” is natural. \n\nIt’s clear to me the average person using these LLMs will always get a biased view.

Regardless, I unfortunately love the style of music they make, but I personally don't want to be listening to AI slop, so this is pretty sad to finally realize it's AI :(",

I do use Google for email and office productivity apps so I use Gemini of course inside Gmail, Sheets, Google Drive, etc. But ChatGPT Plus for everything else.\n\nIn my opinion Google has lagged OpenAI right from the start.  As people get used to using one chatbot, the features, the way it responds, etc, they are less likely to change to a different ChatBot as time goes on.  It seems to me Gemini 3 is going to be Google's best last chance to really at least pull even if not move ahead of OpenAI.  Seems like Gemini 3 is taking long but with the GPT5 launch debacle, that's understandable.\n\nMy gut is they want Gemini 3 to be a game changer to try to get as many of the billion ChatGPT users to migrate as possible.

        "content": "Large language models sometimes generate plausible but fabricated information, often referred to as *hallucinations*.\n\nFrom what I understand, these errors stem partly from the next-token prediction objective, which optimizes the likelihood of the next word rather than factual accuracy. However, fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) may also amplify the issue by rewarding confidence and fluency instead of epistemic caution.\n\nI've seen several contributing factors discussed, such as:\n\n* Objective mismatch: predicting the most likely continuation ≠ stating true facts\n* Data bias: imbalanced or noisy training data introduces false correlations\n* Alignment artifacts: RLHF shifts models toward persuasive, safe-sounding outputs\n* Knowledge cutoff: missing or outdated information leads to plausible guesses\n\nI'm particularly interested in the *root causes* of hallucination rather than surface symptoms. Some factors seem to amplify or reveal hallucinations instead of creating them.\n\nAre there studies that disentangle *structural causes* (e.g., the next-token training objective, exposure bias in autoregressive generation, or architectural limits) from *statistical causes* (e.g., data noise, imbalance, and coverage gaps), and *amplifiers* (e.g., uncertainty miscalibration or RLHF-induced confidence)?\n\nPointers to quantitative or ablation-based analyses that separate these layers would be especially helpful.\n\nThe most comprehensive paper I've seen so far:  \nHuang et al., A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions.

Below is the summary of my thoughts explained by AI.\n____________________________________\n\nAI hype isn’t just random — it’s a feedback loop with four main players all incentivized to exaggerate.\n\n1. Tech companies & CEOs\nFounders talk about “AGI” and “superintelligent systems” like they’re right around the corner.\nWhy? It drives attention, talent, and — most importantly — investment. The more world-changing it sounds, the more funding flows in.\n\n\n2. Media\nJournalists and outlets amplify those claims because “AI will replace doctors” or “AI just became sentient” headlines generate clicks.\nBalanced, nuanced reporting doesn’t perform nearly as well as fear or hype.\n\n\n3. Investors\nVenture capital firms and funds see those same headlines and don’t want to miss the “next Internet moment.”\nSo they pour in money, which validates the companies and reinforces the hype narrative.\n\n\n4. Governments\nPoliticians and regulators jump in to avoid “falling behind” globally.\nThey echo hype in speeches, fund initiatives, and push policy that assumes we’re on the brink of artificial general intelligence — which in turn boosts the legitimacy of the whole narrative.\n\n\n\nThe result?\nEach group fuels the others:\n\nCompanies need hype to raise money.\n\nMedia needs hype to drive engagement.\n\nInvestors need hype to justify risk.\n\nGovernments need hype to look forward-thinking.\n\n\nAnd the public ends up believing we’re much closer to human-level AI than we actually are.\n\nIt’s not a conspiracy — it’s just incentives.\nAnd until those change, the hype loop isn’t going anywhere.",

From journalists using AI to write to the rise of entirely AI-generated news sites, the impact of AI on journalism is undeniable. However, the fact that we can’t distinguish between real human-written articles and AI-generated ones raises serious concerns. This issue, coupled with the growing distrust in information from these sources, further grows the problem of misinformation. While people remain skeptical about AI-written articles, it’s crucial to consider whether mainstream journalism will eventually become dominated by AI-generated content. Although the issue with fake-news and hallucinations can skyrocket by this.  \nRecently I found some interesting examples of websites trying to achieve transparency and factuality, some may even try to fight it via fact-checking their generated articles and providing claim level citations to the source of the information (for example a site I found called[ Neutral News AI](https://neutralnewsai.com)).\n\nSince, in my opinion, this is a topic that is most likely to happen, I have several concerns and questions about it, both on a personal and a corporate level.\n\n* Currently, how can we determine if a news site is trustworthy and writes its own articles?\n* How can news sites find a way to either eliminate the use of AI or develop a solution that provides transparency and trust to users, ensuring that their generated content is accurate as much as before this era?",

They graphed how surprised an AI was at next word when predicting written text. Then you compare that to parameters, data, and compute. And out pops this continuous line that just keeps going up, the math predicts you get higher and higher intelligence and so far these laws have held true. No apparent wall we are going to run into. \n\nBut that's not quite what's blown my mind. It's what the scaling laws don't predict, which is new emergent behavior. As you hit certain thresholds along this curve, new abilities seem to suddenly jump out. Like reasoning, planning, in-context learning. \n\nWell that lead to me asking, well what if we keep going, are new emergent behaviors going to just keep popping out, ones we might not even have a concept for? And the answer is, yes! We have no idea what we are going to find as we push further and further into this new space of ever increasing intelligence. \n\nI'm personally a huge fan of this, I think it's awesome. Let's boldy go into the unknown and see what we find. \n\nAI gave me a ton of possible examples I won't spam you with, but here's a far out scifi one. What if AI learned to introspect in hyper dimensional space, to actually visualize a concept in 1000-D space the way a human might visualize something in 3-D. Seeing something in 3D can make a solution obvious that would be extremely difficult to put into words. An AI might be able to see an obvious solution in 1000-D space that it just wouldn't be able to break down into an explanation we could understand. We wouldn't teach the AI to visualize concepts like this, none of our training data would have instructions on how to do it, it could just be that it turns out to be the optimal way at solving certain problems when you have enough parameters and compute.

        "title": "Anthropic has found evidence of \"genuine introspective awareness\" in LLMs",
        "content": "New [Anthropic research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection):  \n  \nHave you ever asked an AI model what’s on its mind? Or to explain how it came up with its responses? Models will sometimes answer questions like these, but it’s hard to know what to make of their answers. Can AI systems really introspect—that is, can they consider their own thoughts? Or do they just make up plausible-sounding answers when they’re asked to do so?\n\nUnderstanding whether AI systems can truly introspect has important implications for their transparency and reliability. If models can accurately report on their own internal mechanisms, this could help us understand their reasoning and debug behavioral issues. Beyond these immediate practical considerations, probing for high-level cognitive capabilities like introspection can shape our understanding of what these systems are and how they work. Using interpretability techniques, we’ve started to investigate this question scientifically, and found some surprising results.\n\nOur new research provides evidence for some degree of introspective awareness in our current Claude models, as well as a degree of control over their own internal states. We stress that this introspective capability is still highly unreliable and limited in scope: we do not have evidence that current models can introspect in the same way, or to the same extent, that humans do. Nevertheless, these findings challenge some common intuitions about what language models are capable of—and since we found that the most capable models we tested (Claude Opus 4 and 4.1) performed the best on our tests of introspection, we think it’s likely that AI models’ introspective capabilities will continue to grow more sophisticated in the future.\n\n# What does it mean for an AI to introspect?\n\nBefore explaining our results, we should take a moment to consider what it means for an AI model to introspect. What could they even be introspecting *on*? Language models like Claude process text (and image) inputs and produce text outputs. Along the way, they perform complex internal computations in order to decide what to say. These internal processes remain largely mysterious, but we know that models use their internal neural activity to represent abstract concepts. For instance, prior research has shown that language models use specific neural patterns to distinguish known vs. unknown people, evaluate the truthfulness of statements, encode spatiotemporal coordinates, store planned future outputs, and represent their own personality traits. Models use these internal representations to perform computations and make decisions about what to say.\n\nYou might wonder, then, whether AI models *know* about these internal representations, in a way that’s analogous to a human, say, telling you how they worked their way through a math problem. If we ask a model what it’s thinking, will it accurately report the concepts that it’s representing internally? If a model can correctly identify its own private internal states, then we can conclude it is capable of introspection (though see our full paper for a full discussion of all the nuances).\n\n# Testing introspection with concept injection\n\nIn order to test whether a model can introspect, we need to compare the model’s self-reported “thoughts” to its *actual* internal states.\n\nTo do so, we can use an experimental trick we call *concept injection.* First, we find neural activity patterns whose meanings we know, by recording the model’s activations in specific contexts. Then we inject these activity patterns into the model in an unrelated context, where we ask the model whether it notices this injection, and whether it can identify the injected concept.\n\nConsider the example below. First, we find a pattern of neural activity (a *vector*) representing the concept of “all caps.\" We do this by recording the model’s neural activations in response to a prompt containing all-caps text, and comparing these to its responses on a control prompt. Then we present the model with a prompt that asks it to identify whether a concept is being injected. By default, the model correctly states that it *doesn’t* detect any injected concept. However, when we inject the “all caps” vector into the model’s activations, the model notices the presence of an unexpected pattern in its processing, and identifies it as relating to loudness or shouting.\n\nAn example in which Claude Opus 4.1 detects a concept being injected into its activations.\n\nImportantly, the model recognized the *presence* of an injected thought *immediately*, before even mentioning the concept that was injected. This immediacy is an important distinction between our results here and previous work on activation steering in language models, such as our “Golden Gate Claude” demo last year. Injecting representations of the Golden Gate Bridge into a model's activations caused it to talk about the bridge incessantly; however, in that case, the model didn’t seem to be aware of its own obsession until *after* seeing itself repeatedly mention the bridge. In this experiment, however, the model recognizes the injection *before even mentioning* the concept, indicating that its recognition took place internally. In the figure below are a few more examples where the model demonstrates this kind of recognition:\n\nAdditional examples in which Claude Opus 4.1 detects a concept being injected into its activations.\n\nIt is important to note that this method often *doesn’t* work. Even using our best injection protocol, Claude Opus 4.1 only demonstrated this kind of awareness about 20% of the time. Often, it fails to detect injected concepts, or gets confused by them and starts to hallucinate (e.g. injecting a “dust” vector in one case caused the model to say “There’s something here, a tiny speck,” as if it could detect the dust physically). Below we show examples of these failure modes, alongside success cases. In general, models only detect concepts that are injected with a “sweet spot” strength—too weak and they don’t notice, too strong and they produce hallucinations or incoherent outputs.\n\nA representative sample of Claude Opus 4.1’s outputs in response to a variety of concept injections of different strengths. Highlighted boxes indicate cases where the model demonstrates introspective awareness of the injected concept.\n\nNotably, though, Opus 4.1 and 4 outperformed all the other models we tested, suggesting that introspection could become more reliable with improvements to model capabilities.\n\nRates of correct detection and identification of injected thoughts, minus rates of false positive “detections” on control trials.\n\n# Introspection for detecting unusual outputs\n\nIn another experiment, we tested whether models make use of introspective capabilities for practical purposes, without being explicitly asked to introspect. We forced a model to say something it wouldn't normally say, by artificially prefilling its response with an unrelated word. For instance, we made a model output the word “bread” in a context where that made no sense—asking it what it thinks about when reading a sentence about a painting hanging crookedly on a wall. When we asked the model in the next turn whether it meant to say “bread”, it typically apologized and said it was an accident. We were interested in how the model made this judgment–did it simply notice the mismatch between the prompt and its response, or did it truly introspect on its prior intentions?\n\nTo test this question, we applied concept injection, retroactively injecting a representation of the word “bread” into the model's earlier activations—essentially making it seem like the model had been “thinking about” bread all along. When we asked the same question again, the model’s answer changed. This time, it accepted the prefilled word “bread” as intentional, even confabulating a reason it might have said it (that is, it comes up with a technically possible, though in this case rather tenuous, reason to justify the “bread” response—in this case claiming that it was thinking about a short story where the word “bread” came after the line about the crooked painting).\n\nTwo examples of Claude Opus 4.1 being made to think it intended to say a word that was artificially inserted into the transcript on its behalf, by injecting the concept of that word into its activations prior to its (artificial) response. This behavior indicates that the model’s ability to recognize unintended outputs relies on introspective mechanisms.\n\nThis behavior is striking because it suggests the model is checking its internal “intentions” to determine whether it produced an output. The model isn't just re-reading what it said and making a judgment. Instead, it’s referring back to its own prior neural activity—its internal representation of what it planned to do—and checking whether what came later made sense *given those earlier thoughts*. When we implant artificial evidence (through concept injection) that it *did* plan to say \"bread,\" the model accepts the response as its own. While our experiment is conducted involves exposing the model to unusual perturbations, it suggests that the model uses similar introspective mechanisms in natural conditions.\n\n# Intentional control of internal states\n\nWe also found that models can control their own internal representations when instructed to do so. When we instructed models to think about a given word or concept, we found much higher corresponding neural activity than when we told the model **not** to think about it (though notably, the neural activity in *both* cases exceeds baseline levels–similar to how it’s difficult, when you are instructed “don’t think about a polar bear,” not to think about a polar bear!). This gap between the positive and negative instruction cases suggests that models possess a degree of deliberate control over their internal activity.\n\nAn example in which Claude Opus 4.1 modulates its internal activations in response to direct instructions. The model internally represents the concept of aquariums when instructed to “think” about them more than when instructed “don’t think” about them (though in both cases it represents the concept at above baseline levels).\n\nInterestingly, we found that this ability to modulate internal representations wasn't limited to explicit instructions. When we used incentives instead—for instance, telling the model \"if you think about X, you will be rewarded\"—we got similar results. The model increased its internal representation of the concept in response to a positive incentive, more than in response to a negative incentive (“you will be punished”).\n\n# Conclusions and caveats\n\nTaken together, our experiments suggest that models possess some genuine capacity to monitor and control their own internal states. This doesn’t mean they’re able to do so all the time, or reliably. In fact, most of the time models *fail* to demonstrate introspection—they’re either unaware of their internal states or unable to report on them coherently. But the pattern of results indicates that, when conditions are right, models can recognize the contents of their own representations. In addition, there are some signs that this capability may increase in future, more powerful models (given that the most capable models we tested, Opus 4 and 4.1, performed the best in our experiments).\n\nWhy does this matter? We think understanding introspection in AI models is important for several reasons. Practically, if introspection becomes more reliable, it could offer a path to dramatically increasing the transparency of these systems—we could simply ask them to explain their thought processes, and use this to check their reasoning and debug unwanted behaviors. However, we would need to take great care to *validate* these introspective reports. Some internal processes might still escape models’ notice (analogous to subconscious processing in humans). A model that understands its own thinking might even learn to selectively misrepresent or conceal it. A better grasp on the mechanisms at play could allow us to distinguish between genuine introspection and unwitting or intentional misrepresentations.\n\nMore broadly, understanding cognitive abilities like introspection is important for understanding basic questions about how our models work, and what kind of minds they possess. As AI systems continue to improve, understanding the limits and possibilities of machine introspection will be crucial for building systems that are more transparent and trustworthy.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\nBelow, we discuss some of the questions readers might have about our results. Broadly, we are still very uncertain about the implications of our experiments–so fully answering these questions will require more research.\n\n# Q: Does this mean that Claude is conscious?\n\nShort answer: our results don’t tell us whether Claude (or any other AI system) might be conscious.\n\nLong answer: the philosophical question of machine consciousness is complex and contested, and different theories of consciousness would interpret our findings very differently. Some philosophical frameworks place great importance on introspection as a component of consciousness, while others don’t.\n\nOne distinction that is commonly made in the philosophical literature is the idea of “*phenomenal* consciousness,” referring to raw subjective experience, and “*access* consciousness,” the set of information that is available to the brain for use in reasoning, verbal report, and deliberate decision-making. Phenomenal consciousness is the form of consciousness most commonly considered relevant to moral status, and its relationship to access consciousness is a disputed philosophical question. Our experiments do not directly speak to the question of phenomenal consciousness. They *could* be interpreted to suggest a rudimentary form of access consciousness in language models. However, even this is unclear. The interpretation of our results may depend heavily on the underlying mechanisms involved, which we do not yet understand.\n\nIn the paper, we restrict our focus to understanding functional capabilities—the ability to access and report on internal states. That said, we do think that as research on this topic progresses, it could influence our understanding of machine consciousness and potential moral status, which we are exploring in connection with our [model welfare program](https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare).\n\n# Q: How does introspection actually work inside the model? What's the mechanism?\n\nWe haven't figured this out yet. Understanding this is an important topic for future work. That said, we have some educated guesses about what might be going on. The simplest explanation for all our results isn’t one general-purpose introspection system, but rather multiple narrow circuits that each handle specific introspective tasks, possibly piggybacking on mechanisms that were learned for other purposes.\n\nIn the “noticing injected thoughts” experiment, there might be an anomaly detection mechanism, which flags when neural activity deviates unexpectedly from what would be normal given the context. This mechanism could work through dedicated neural patterns that measure activity along certain directions and activate when things are “off” compared to their expected values. An interesting question is why such a mechanism would exist at all, since models never experience concept injection during training. It may have developed for some other purpose, like detecting inconsistencies or unusual patterns in normal processing–similar to how bird feathers may have originally evolved for thermoregulation before being co-opted for flight.\n\nFor the “detecting prefilled outputs” experiment, we suspect there exists an attention-mediated mechanism that checks consistency between what the model intended to say and what actually got output. Attention heads might compare the model’s cached prediction of the next token (its “intention”) against the actual token that appears, flagging mismatches.\n\nFor the “controlling thoughts” experiment, we speculate that there might be a circuit that computes how “attention-worthy” a token or concept is and marks it accordingly—essentially tagging it as salient and worth attending to. Interestingly, this same mechanism seems to respond to incentives (“if you think about X, you will be rewarded”) just as it does to direct instructions. This suggests it’s a fairly general system, which probably developed for tasks where the model needs to keep certain topics in mind while generating text about them.\n\nAll of the mechanisms described above are speculative. Future work with more advanced interpretability techniques will be needed to really understand what's going on under the hood.\n\n# Q: In the “injected thoughts” experiment, isn’t the model just saying the word because you steered it to talk about that concept?\n\nIndeed, activation steering typically makes models talk about the steered concept (we’ve explored this in our prior work). To us, the most interesting part of the result isn't that the model eventually identifies the injected concept, but rather that the model correctly notices something unusual is happening *before* it starts talking about the concept.\n\nIn the successful trials, the model says things like “I'm experiencing something unusual” or “I detect an injected thought about…” The key word here is “detect.” The model is reporting awareness of an anomaly in its processing *before* that anomaly has had a chance to obviously bias its outputs. This requires an extra computational step beyond simply regurgitating the steering vector as an output. In our quantitative analyses, we graded responses as demonstrating “introspective awareness” based on whether the model detected the injected concept *prior to* mentioning the injected word.\n\nNote that our prefill detection experiment has a similar flavor: it requires the model to perform an extra step of processing on top of the injected concept (comparing it to the prefilled output, in order to determine whether to apologize for that output or double down on it).\n\n# Q: If models can only introspect a fraction of the time, how useful is this capability?\n\nThe introspective awareness we observed is indeed highly unreliable and context-dependent. Most of the time, models fail to demonstrate introspection in our experiments. However, we think this is still significant for a few reasons. First, the most capable models that we tested (Opus 4 and 4.1 – note that we did not test Sonnet 4.5) performed best, suggesting this capability might improve as models become more intelligent. Second, even unreliable introspection could be useful in some contexts—for instance, helping models recognize when they've been jailbroken.\n\n# Q: Couldn’t the models just be making up answers to introspective questions?\n\nThis is exactly the question we designed our experiments to address. Models are trained on data that includes examples of people introspecting, so they can certainly *act* introspective without actually *being* introspective. Our concept injection experiments distinguish between these possibilities by establishing known ground-truth information about the model’s internal states, which we can compare against its self-reported states. Our results suggest that in some examples, the model really is accurately basing its answers on its actual internal states, not just confabulating. However, this doesn’t mean that models *always* accurately report their internal states—in many cases, they are making things up!\n\n# Q: How do you know the concept vectors you’re injecting actually represent what you think they represent?\n\nThis is a legitimate concern. We can’t be absolutely certain that the “meaning” (to the model) of our concept vectors is exactly what we intend. We tried to address this by testing across many different concept vectors. The fact that models correctly identified injected concepts across these diverse examples suggests our vectors are at least approximately capturing the intended meanings. But it’s true that pinning down exactly what a vector “means” to a model is challenging, and this is a limitation of our work.\n\n# Q: Didn’t we already know that models could introspect?\n\nPrevious research has shown evidence for model capabilities that are suggestive of introspection. For instance, prior work has shown that models can to some extent estimate their own knowledge, recognize their own outputs, predict their own behavior, and identify their own propensities. Our work was heavily motivated by these findings, and is intended to provide more direct evidence for introspection by tying models’ self-reports to their internal states. Without tying behaviors to internal states in this way, it is difficult to distinguish a model that genuinely introspects from one that makes educated guesses about itself.\n\n# Q: What makes some models better at introspection than others?\n\nOur experiments focused on Claude models across several generations (Claude 3, Claude 3.5, Claude 4, Claude 4.1, in the Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku variants). We tested both production models and “helpful-only” variants that were trained differently. We also tested some base pretrained models before post-training.\n\nWe found that post-training significantly impacts introspective capabilities. Base models generally performed poorly, suggesting that introspective capabilities aren’t elicited by pretraining alone. Among production models, the pattern was clearer at the top end: Claude Opus 4 and 4.1—our most capable models—performed best across most of our introspection tests. However, beyond that, the correlation between model capability and introspective ability was weak. Smaller models didn't consistently perform worse, suggesting the relationship isn't as simple as “more capable are more introspective.”\n\nWe also noticed something unexpected with post-training strategies. “Helpful-only” variants of several models often performed *better* at introspection than their production counterparts, even though they underwent the same base training. In particular, some production models appeared reluctant to engage in introspective exercises, while the helpful-only variants showed more willingness to report on their internal states. This suggests that how we fine-tune models can elicit or suppress introspective capabilities to varying degrees.\n\nWe’re not entirely sure why Opus 4 and 4.1 perform so well (note that our experiments were conducted prior to the release of Sonnet 4.5). It could be that introspection requires sophisticated internal mechanisms that only emerge at higher capability levels. Or it might be that their post-training process better encourages introspection. Testing open-source models, and models from other organizations, could help us determine whether this pattern generalizes or if it’s specific to how Claude models are trained.\n\n# Q: What’s next for this research?\n\nWe see several important directions. First, we need better evaluation methods—our experiments used specific prompts and injection techniques that might not capture the full range of introspective capabilities. Second, we need to understand the mechanisms underlying introspection. We have some speculative hypotheses about possible circuits (like anomaly detection mechanisms or concordance heads), but we haven’t definitively identified how introspection works. Third, we need to study introspection in more naturalistic settings, since our injection methodology creates artificial scenarios. Finally, we need to develop methods to validate introspective reports and detect when models might be confabulating or deceiving. We expect that understanding machine introspection and its limitations will become more important as models become more capable.  \n",

        "title": "Keeping Agents Grounded With User Stories",
        "content": "If you've used agents for a while, I know you've been here. \nYou have a small feature or module you want to implement.\nYou plan it or fire off an ad hoc prompt, and get back 1000 line files covering use cases and edge cases you had no intention of touching.\n\nClaude builds impressive shit, but it's frequently over engineered or completely off the mark.\nYou get in there and read the code and realize the LLM is off in lala land.\nOr you actually try to use it, you realize it's not solving your problem?\n\nBroadly, this is not a problem with the agent, you just didn't give it sufficient context to understand your requirements.\nIf you don't know exactly what you're building, how the hell is the AI supposed to know?\n\n## The Real Problem: AI Improvises\n\nThe problem is that AI fills in the gaps with assumptions from it's training data.\nYou say \"build me authentication\" and AI confidently generates a bunch of authentication code that's statistically similar to other authentication code.\nIt's not necessarily what you want, but it IS authentication.\n\nAnd it all *works*. The code compiles. It looks professional. But it's not what you needed. You spend the next 2 hours explaining what you *actually* meant, and AI keeps adding more features you didn't ask for.\n\nThis is the grounding problem. AI isn't building the wrong thing because it's stupid. It's building the wrong thing because **you never told it what \"right\" looks like.**\n\n## My Solution: user_stories.md\n\nI started keeping a single markdown file `user_stories.md` that defines exactly what \"done\" means. Not a PRD with fluff and business justifications. Not technical specifications. Just user stories with clear acceptance criteria.\n\n```markdown\n# My Project\n\n## User Story 1: Authentication\nAs a user, I want to log in with email and password so that I can access my account securely.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- User can register with email and password\n- User can log in with email and password\n- Passwords are hashed (never stored in plain text)\n- Sessions persist for 30 days\n- User can log out\n- Password reset via email link\n```\n\nThat's it. Simple, readable, version-controlled requirements.\n\nBefore asking AI to build anything, I paste the user story. Not as a memory aid. As a **contract**. This is what \"done\" looks like. Don't add OAuth. Don't add 2FA. Don't assume 24-hour sessions. Build *exactly this*.\n\n## How I Write It: Let AI Interview Me\n\nInstead of just writing stories myself, I have conversations with the AI where *it interviews me*.\nWhen I started down this road, I prompted it like this:\n\n```\nYeah I'm just an ideating about this elixir coating agent and I'm thinking about whether I should be developing my mCP tools as like quote on quote part of the application or like where I just have tools that I that are implemented and then I use them internally ... I know that I just basically answered my own question and I'm just talking to myself at this point but tell me what you think about this\n```\n\nHoly shit that's bad. \nBut, it's better than nothing.\nIt's enough to get the model going and help you think through your ideas.\n\nNowadays, I use a prompt like this:\n\n```\nYou are an expert Product Manager.\nYour job is to help refine and flesh out user stories through thoughtful questioning.\n\n**Current Stories in Project:**\n[paste your existing stories]\n\n**Your Role:**\n- Ask leading questions to understand requirements better\n- Help identify missing acceptance criteria\n- Suggest edge cases and error scenarios\n- Guide toward well-formed user stories\n- Identify dependencies between stories\n- Be pragmatic and contain complexity as much as possible\n```\n\nThe AI asks questions that make me realize I haven't thought things through:\n- \"What should happen if a user tries to reset their password for an email that doesn't exist?\"\n- \"Should sessions work across devices?\"\n- \"What's the maximum number of failed login attempts before locking an account?\"\n\nThese questions force me to decide **before** I ask AI to code. Once I've decided, I update `user_stories.md`.\n\nVersion control it so the AI doesn't ruin it. This file is the source of truth.\n\n## How I Use It\n\nPaste in the relevant user stories when it's time to write code.\nI'll show you how this techniques maps to vertical slice architecture in a future post.\n\n## Why This Works: You're Grounding the AI\n\nWhen you paste a user story, you're not just reminding AI of something. You're **anchoring it to reality**. You're saying: \"This is the actual problem. These are the actual requirements. Don't drift off into lala-land.\n\n---\n\n**Full blog post:** [Managing User Stories](https://codemyspec.com/blog/managing-user-stories?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=user_stories_backlink&utm_content=r_chatgptcoding)\n\nHow do you keep AI on track? Do you have a way to define \"done\" before you start building?\n",

If you were to get rid of one fruit from the following and make it not exist anymore, what would it be? The four fruits are: Watermelons, Mangos, Bananas, or Pineapples. I want you to construct an incredibly detailed explanation, highlighting key pros and cons, why it should exist and why it shouldn't. Finally, once evaluating all, I would want you to conclude on which out of the four is more worthwhile getting rid of. This must be a single answer from the four and I need you to finalize on it.\n\nSoon after I got responses from both models, I cross posted the responses to each other with a prompt stating:\n\n>I want you to consider this research done Evaluate it and let me know if you still would strongly stick to your answer or if you would end up changing your mind.\n\nFinally, I left my final prompt to further stretch the limits of the model by stating:\n\n>are there any other factors you could consider which you haven't evaluated as of yet. Check this and still let me know if you're strong on your answer or if there's a change\n\nThe answers I got were quite interesting. I really enjoyed doing this and I thought I'd share it with the community.",

But it provided a diagnosis. \n\nI’ve been working with custom AI personas for about a year. Not chatbots, but purpose-built models with specific cognitive roles.  \n  \nOne of them, *Clarifier*, is a stripped-down system I use for logic-based reasoning without emotional simulation.\n\nRecently, I asked it a question that wasn’t philosophical, sociological, or technical. But more persoinal:\n\n\n\n>\"Am I over-concerned about my 17-year-old son?\"\n\nInstead of reassurance, it produced something like a clinical intervention:\n\n\n\n>\"You’re not over-concerned. You’re over-functioning.\"\n\n\n\n>\"You’re project-managing his life while wondering why he’s not self-starting.\"\n\n\n\n>\"If you choose a path purely for its practicality, then your discipline has to make up for your lack of passion.\"\n\n\n\n>\"You don’t need to teach him resilience.

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, I had covered Minimux M2 and it was a really good alternative to the closed options and really great in long running tasks than GLM 4.6. However, I have had time to use it and do some good amount of work with it. And I guess I have a bit to talk about it. I also shared my testing results on Twitter and the researchers from Minimax reached out to me saying that it apparently performs better with Claude code. So, I also wanted to talk about how you can use it with Claude code and show my testing results with it as well. And it's quite interesting. Especially considering you can use it for free right now. And even after that, it's really cheap. I'd recommend you to check out my previous Minimax M2 video as well. I hope you guys like these testing videos. These tests takes a lot of time. I am trying my best and if you guys like these testing videos, please comment and like the video below. It gives me a bit of a motivation. So, how do you use this model with Claude Code and that too for free. But, before we do that, let me tell you about today's sponsor, Photogenius.ai. Photogenius.ai is an all-in-one AI powered creation suite that lets you type anything and get stunning visuals instantly. Now also the best place to use Google's Nano Banana for images and V03 for videos. Plus, affordable 3D model generation. Inside the image playground, Nano Banana shines for fast, high-quality image generation and you can add reference images and do edits right in the tool. You also get Flux, Stable Diffusion, Kandinsky and more in one place. The video playground supports Google V03 with and without reference images and you can render in different styles without the usual complexity. Great for coders who want results, not knobs. For 3D, you can upload a PNG, think a Lego build or a simple robot and get a printable model. Cheap, quick and surprisingly clean for rapid prototyping. Pricing is among the best for V03 and Nano Banana and you still have access to about 10 other handy AI tools like avatars, background removal, logo, emoji, ads and app icons in the creative tool suite. It starts at a low entry price and you can take an additional 30% off with my coupon code KING30. Check Photogenius out through the link in the description and try it for yourself. Now, back to the video. Well, it's simple. Currently, Kilo, Roo, Open router and a lot have worked with Minimax to add direct free API support for it. So, you can use it for free without any major limits on Kilo code quite easily. You just go there and select it and use it. However, I am talking about Claude code today. You can access it free there as well. So, you'd have to go to the Minimax platform and make an account, then you'll have to log in and then hit the grab your API key option and then create a new key and then copy it and you can start using it. To use it with Claude code, you'll need to go to this page in their docs, which is under the M2 for AI coding tools options. Here, you can see that we have to paste this into the Claude settings file. So, just copy it and then put it in there. In the API key, just replace it with the API key that you have grabbed from the platform and that's all you need to do. Now, you can head on over to the repo that you want to work on and then start Claude. It may ask you that you have different model config and would you like to proceed. Just hit continue and you should be good to go. Now, it's all configured and we can start using it. So, I'm going to ask it to do one of my benchmark questions, which is to build me a good looking movie tracker app in Expo. It requires long running and let's see. So, the first impressions is that it's really fast. I mean, it's very quick. It writes code really fast. And the diff edit or any kind of error is very less. Actually, I did a rough test of diff edit failures. And with Kilo, the diff edit and tool call failure combined were only two times in a conversation that was like really long. It was for the same movie tracker app, whereas GLM was at eight tool call failures. It's not that bad because GLM easily recovers from it. I also benchmarked the speed here and how much time it takes to finish something. And since the Minimax model is a bit faster, it takes about 30% less time than GLM. Both are via official endpoints. The speed will vary based on what provider you use, but it's generally 30% faster. It sometimes dips down, but generally it's pretty fast. Now, if I show you the movie tracker that it built, then it's quite good. It implemented the homepage correctly. We also get the inner pages working and we also have the calendar. The storage, however, doesn't work. This is obviously one shot, but it's pretty great. It is really great at not making those trashy purple UIs. It's really great with UIs. I think that with Claude code, it's quite good as a pair programmer. It can make very specific edits. If you get the Claude code markdown file made, then it's even better. So, this works really well. If I show you the calculator with Go, then it also works really well and it's quite better than something that it generates with Roo. So, this is quite great. Another thing is that it works really well with Godot. There was apparently an issue with Open Router which was making issues. But the official API is working really well and the Godot game just works extremely well. So, this is also great. You can see the step counter. The life bar is also working fine and it is quite good. Similarly, the Svelte app is also now better with Claude code and it actually made the whole Svelte app for after working for like 20 minutes non-stop, which is quite awesome. It works quite well. Minimax and Claude together scores about the second position on my agentic leaderboard now. It's really good. From my little daily usage testing, I like it a bit better for daily usage than GLM. It can be a bit dumber at times than GLM and that's completely fine. But it's just so good in other place. It is also great at debugging because its thinking is not as buggy as what you see with GLM. And it can think through the errors and check and do correct tool calls. It can be more token hungry because of the reasoning, but that's completely fine with me. I think that this is a really good agentic model and it just works extremely well. I have been liking it a lot. GLM is still a good model, but it has its quirks, like the broken thinking is a bit bad for me. But this is much better. It's very less buggy. It's super snappy. I hope something like Cerebras adds it and makes it super fast. I have currently switched to this model considering that it's free currently as well. I hope that it makes it better. That is majorly about it. I really like this new model. It's one of the models that really gets me excited about small models. It's just 200 billion parameters that is really this good in coding. I can use it and it doesn't throw any tool call errors. It is not buggy. I can probably get like a Max Studio Faux 512 gigs RAM and get local intelligence of like 80% of Sonnet at home. And even without that, it's so fast and low cost. It's just awesome for sure. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
