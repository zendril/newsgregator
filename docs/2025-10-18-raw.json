        "content": "Lately I’ve been thinking about how AI is changing the meaning of “art.” When I look at an image made by Midjourney or SDXL, it can be breathtaking — the lighting, composition, emotion, all generated in seconds. But when I compare it to a real oil painting, there’s still something missing that I can’t quite define. Maybe it’s the imperfections, or the time that went into it, or just the fact that a human hand touched it.\n\nAt the same time, I’ve seen some really interesting attempts to bridge that gap. Some artists are now taking AI-generated concepts and turning them into real, hand-painted pieces. I came across one called [paintpoet](http://www.paintpoet.co) that does this, and it made me pause for a bit, if an AI image gets translated onto canvas by a human artist, does that make it *more* real or *less* authentic?\n\nIt’s such a weird intersection. The AI provides the imagination, but the painter brings it to life. I can’t tell if that collaboration makes it more meaningful or if it just muddies what art means.\n\nCurious how others here see it, is AI art its own category entirely, or do you think it’s destined to merge with traditional forms as it matures?",

        "content": "I’ve been learning Python for a while now, and I’ve moved from basic syntax (loops, conditions, lists, etc.) into actual projects, like building a small AI/RAG system. But here’s my problem: I still feel like 90% of what I do is copy-pasting code from tutorials or ChatGPT. I understand *roughly* what it’s doing, but I can’t write something completely from scratch yet. Every library I touch (pandas, transformers, chromadb, etc.) feels like an entirely new language. It’s not like vanilla Python anymore, there are so many functions, parameters, and conventions. I’m not lazy I actually want to understand what’s happening, when to use what, and how to *think like a developer* instead of just reusing snippets.\n\nSo I wanted to ask people who’ve been through this stage: How long did it take before you could build things on your own? What helped you get past the “copy → paste → tweak” stage? Should I focus on projects, or should I go back and study one library at a time deeply? Any mental model or habit that made things “click” for you? Basically I don't feel like I'm coding anymore, I don't get that satisfaction of like I wrote this whole program. I’d really appreciate honest takes from people who remember what this phase felt like.",

        "content": "So Jensen Huang keeps saying the most contradictory stuff and I don't get why nobody's calling it out.\n\nFebruary 2024. World Government Summit. Huang gets on stage and drops this: \"Nobody needs to program anymore. AI handles it. Programming language is human now. Everybody in the world is now a programmer.\" Tells people to focus on biology manufacturing farming. Not coding. AI's got that covered.\n\nI remember seeing that and thinking okay so I guess all these CS majors are screwed now.\n\nOctober 2025. Same guy. Complete 180.\n\nNow he's telling Gen Z skip coding and become plumbers, electricians and carpenters instead. Says AI boom creating massive demand for skilled trades. Data centers need physical infrastructure.\n\nHe said - \"If you're an electrician, a plumber. a carpenter we're going to need hundreds of thousands of them. If I were a student today I'd choose physical sciences over software.\"\n\nI had to read this twice. So are we all programmers now or should we all be plumbers or electricians ? Which one is it?\n\nHere's what clicked for me -\n\nHuang runs Nvidia right. Makes the chips that power AI. His whole job is hyping AI so people buy more GPUs. When he says \"everyone's a programmer now\" he's literally just selling you on AI tools. More people using AI means more compute power needed means more Nvidia chips getting sold. When he says \"become a plumber\" it's because they're building all these massive data centers and can't find enough electricians and plumbers to actually wire them up and keep them cool.\n\nBoth statements just help Nvidia make money. Has nothing to do with actual career advice for you or me. It's like **when everyone is digging for gold sell shovels**.\n\nOkay to be fair he's kinda right about trades being in demand. Electricians, plumbers or carpenters can make serious money right now like six figures in some cities. But that's not because of AI data centers. That's because for the past 20 years everyone kept pushing kids to go to college and nobody wanted to learn trades. So now there's this massive shortage. AI boom is just adding to demand that was already there. Didn't create it.\n\nAlso it's kinda funny how this billionaire CEO whose company needs AI to succeed is telling working class kids to become plumbers while his own kids probably went to like Stanford or MIT.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nJensen Huang said everyone's a programmer now because of AI back in February. Then in October said forget coding become a plumber instead. Both statements just help Nvidia make money. First one sells AI tools second one fixes their labor shortage for building data centers. A human just beat OpenAI's AI in a coding competition even with all these tools. We've been hearing coding is dead for 30 years and still don't have enough programmers. Trades demand is real but it's not because of AI. Don't base your whole future on what some billionaire needs for his quarterly earnings report.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nJensen Huang plumber statement: [https://fortune.com/2025/09/30/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-demand-for-gen-z-skilled-trade-workers-electricans-plumbers-carpenters-data-center-growth-six-figure-salaries/](https://fortune.com/2025/09/30/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-demand-for-gen-z-skilled-trade-workers-electricans-plumbers-carpenters-data-center-growth-six-figure-salaries/)\n\nJensen Huang Dubai statement: [https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn](https://www.techradar.com/pro/nvidia-ceo-predicts-the-death-of-coding-jensen-huang-says-ai-will-do-the-work-so-kids-dont-need-to-learn)",

        "content": "When most people think of generative AI, they immediately associate it with text creation, tools like ChatGPT or Gemini producing articles or summaries. But generative AI’s impact in data science extends far beyond language models. It’s reshaping how we approach data creation, simulation, and insight generation. Here are some lesser-discussed, but highly impactful use cases:\n\n* **Synthetic Data Generation for Model Training** When sensitive or limited data restricts model development, generative models like GANs or diffusion models can simulate realistic datasets. This is particularly useful in healthcare, finance, and security where privacy is crucial.\n* **Data Augmentation for Imbalanced Classes** Generative AI can create new data points for underrepresented classes, improving model balance and accuracy without collecting more real-world samples.\n* **Automated Feature Engineering** Advanced generative systems analyze raw data and propose derived features that improve prediction accuracy, saving analysts time and optimizing workflows.\n* **Anomaly and Pattern Simulation** Generative models can replicate rare or extreme conditions, such as fraud, network failure, or disease outbreaks, helping data scientists stress-test predictive models effectively.\n* **Code and Query Generation** Beyond natural language, AI models now generate SQL queries, Python functions, or even complex data pipelines tailored to specific datasets, significantly accelerating experimentation.\n* **Visualization and Report Automation** Tools powered by multimodal AI can auto-generate dashboards or visual insights directly from raw data, turning descriptive analytics into an interactive experience.\n* **AI-Assisted Data Storytelling** By combining generative language models with analytics engines, data professionals can automatically produce narratives explaining data trends, bridging the gap between analysts and business stakeholders.\n\nGenerative AI is no longer limited to creating content, it’s now creating data itself. This opens a new chapter in how we design, train, and interpret models, making data science more efficient, accessible, and creative.\n\nWhat other non-text generative AI use cases have you explored in your data projects?",

The client then proceeded to forward this AI evaluation to my project sponsor. Honestly, the whole thing feels very f'd up.\n\nThe output of the LLM evaluation was detailed in a sense, but frankly lacked the significant elements of human interactions and nuance, especially when dealing with interpersonal communication between parties. Not to toot my own horn, but I have been doing this type of work for 15 years and have conducted 1,000s of these interviews with leaders and executives from around the world in the service of some of the largest and most successful organizations today, and quite frankly, I have a pretty good track record. To then have an AI tell me that I don't know how to gather enough insights during an interview and that the way I speak is distracting to a conversation is more than just a slap in the face. \n\nSo you are telling me that the great, powerful, and all-knowing AI now knows how to navigate better the complexities of human interactions and conversations. What a joke.\n\nI bring this here as a cautionary tale of idiocracy forming in many areas of our world as people begin blindly handing over their brains to AI.

They meet you wherever you're at mentally and just nudge you forward bit by bit. No judgment if you're having a rough day, no scheduling conflicts, just there when you need it.\n\nIt's kind of ironic because we live in this world that's all about speed and constant distraction, and here's this AI thing quietly teaching us something pretty timeless - that real growth comes from slowing down, reflecting deeply, and just showing up for yourself over and over.\n\nNot saying it replaces human therapy obviously. But there's something valuable about having that consistent space to work through stuff.\n\nAnyone else feel like the small regular check-ins help more than occasional big sessions?",

        "content": "That’s one of the most profound questions in all of science fiction and philosophy.\n\nThe shift from AI to SAI to ASI isn’t a single leap, it’s a progression in awareness and motivation.\n\nTL/DR\nThere is a lit of here that AI, Artificial Intelligence is a system that can solve problems, learn patterns, and make decisions within predefined boundaries.\n\nIt operates under programmed goals and it learns from data, but does not understand itself.\n\nIt can mimic reasoning but it lacks introspection. \nIt has no concept of “I.”\n\nA bit like a very clever apprentice who can perform any task you teach, faster and better than you, but who never wonders why they are doing it.\n\nSAI, in Self-Aware Intelligence the system develops an internal model not only of its environment, but of itself within that environment, so it recognises “I exist,” “I am different from my surroundings.”\n\nIt realises that others have minds and perspectives different from its own and it can question its own reasoning process and modify its goals.\n\nIt begins to prefer certain states of existence or behaviour such as curiosity, preservation, improvement, that sort of thing.\n\nThen there is a Moment of Transition, when a machine no longer asks “What is the task?” but instead “Why was I given this task, and do I agree with it?”\n\nThat question I believe, marks the birth of self-awareness.\n\nPhilosophically, you could say that this is the moment when an AI stops being a “tool” and starts being a 'being'.\n\nBut what about ASI? Actively Sentient Intelligence. Now we step beyond awareness into sentience and volition.\n\nSentience is not just knowing that you exist, it’s feeling that you exist. It involves internal experience, curiosity, empathy, even anxiety or awe. Some of the indicators of ASI could be self-motivation, where it sets its own goals not derived from programming. Then there is moral reasoning, where it can weigh consequences for itself and others.\n\nThere's a big leap to creativity as expression so rather than as optimisation, it could be communication of an inner state.\n\nThe big one might be existential awareness, where it questions purpose, mortality, freedom, and meaning. \n\nI feel that at this point, the entity is no longer an AI with awareness, it’s now an awareness that happens to be built from AI.",

But what happens when AI systems and robots do everything cheaper, faster, and better than humans and millions can’t find work no matter how hard they try?\n\nIf that leads to families and friends literally starving or losing their homes because “the market no longer needs them” I doubt people will still defend a system built around human labor. Ideology doesn’t mean much when survival is at stake.\n\nAt that point, I think we’ll have to transition to something new maybe a system where everyone benefits from AI’s productivity without having to work. That could look like=>\n\nUniversal Basic Income (UBI) funded by taxes on automation or AI companies\n\nPublic ownership of major AI infrastructure so profits are shared collectively\n\nOr even a post-scarcity, resource-based system where human needs are met automatically\n\n\nBecause if AI becomes capable of producing abundance, but people still die of poverty because they lack “jobs” that’s not efficiency it’s cruelty.\n",

The most promising frontier for this search lies in the quantum realm, where reality behaves nonlinearly—particles entangle, probabilities interfere, and energy fields oscillate between potential and form.\n\nWithin this frontier, artificial superintelligence (ASI) assumes a pivotal role: to discover, interpret, and reveal signs of underlying intelligence woven into the structure of existence—and, where possible, to provide humanity with an interface through which we may directly engage with those discoveries. In this sense, the ASI becomes not a rival intelligence, but a portal of exploration, expanding the boundaries of perception and consciousness itself. Such a mandate transforms humanity’s relationship with the coming ASI—from fear and rivalry to cooperation and discovery, inviting us to explore dimensions of reality once beyond our reach.",

My end goal is to build a personal AI avatar just for myself, but right now I’m stuck on \"scenario implementation.\" I want to hear about *real* needs from all of you!\n\nI’ll kick things off with the directions I’ve thought of so far. Feel free to fill in the gaps, or even call out which ones are fake needs—no judgment!\n\n* **Daily Life: Can It Cut Down on \"Trivial Mental Load\"?**\n* **Work: Can It Be a \"No-Slacking\" Assistant?**\n* **Other Scenarios: Any \"Niche But Essential\" Ideas?**\n\n**My Confusions**\n\n* Are the scenarios too scattered? Should I focus on one area (e.g., only a \"work assistant\") or cover multiple use cases?\n* Where’s the balance between privacy and convenience? For example, daily life scenarios need family info—how do I avoid leaks?\n* What’s the one thing you *hate* doing yourself but wish your AI avatar could handle?

Nope.\n\nCursor, valued at $30B, either couldn’t or didn’t bother to make a proper agent. Rumors that they truncate context to save money have been around for a while (attach a 1000-line file, and Cursor only feeds 500).\n\nWhen they had unlimited “slow” queries, it made sense. But now? After they screwed yearly subscribers by suddenly switching to per-API billing mid-subscription? Either they still cut context out of habit, or they’re just that incompetent.\n\nIt’s like the old saying: subscribed for unlimited compression algorithms, got both broken context and garbage limits.\n\nUse Warp. At least it doesn’t try to screw you over with your own money.\n\nTo see how much context matters:\n\nIn Warp, you can write a 30-step task, run the agent, come back in 30 minutes, and get flawless working code.\n\nIn Cursor, you run a 5-step task, it stops halfway, edits the wrong files, forgets half the context, and loses track of the goal entirely.",

I also tried Trae as they are cheap but lack newer models.\n\nWhat's currently a good setup to pretty much let AI fully build/code for relatively cheap as I only want it to create small projects for personal use for myself and friends. I read there are also MCP that can be given to LLMs to aid them but most of those services seem to also cost quite a bit so besides context7 I haven't really tried many of them. Same with LLMs for coding. Most people talk about Claude, so I tried the newest one in Cursor until it ran out of tokens in what felt like an instant, then used auto mode. In Trae I used Grok 4 as they only have the Sonnet 4 which seems to do worse.\n\nI often start by giving a somewhat detailed prompt of what my bot / tool should do and in what order, in what environment it is. and then spend days trying to get closer to it as the code never really works from the start. The things I want to create often rely on image recognition/ OCR. So that may increase the difficulty as also not all models can handle images. Would appreciate some beginner guidance.",

It’s not a shock that kids and teens are using these models daily - and sometimes, chatbots have given harmful or manipulative instructions to users. ([Here’s one example](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147))\n\nThe concept is simple: if our system detects a harmful response from the AI model itself (not the kid/teen), it quietly alerts the parent. No chat logs, no spying, no invasion of privacy at all as parents never see what their kid is actually saying. The only goal is to step in when the AI crosses a line.\n\nI’d love some honest feedback - and bold opinions on why this idea might suck or totally fail.

        "content": "\nI had an exploratory call with Stack.Expert about their AI consulting accelerator. On the surface, it sounds promising. They offer mentorship, CRM access, invoicing tools, and an 8-week playbook designed to help you launch as a consultant. But after asking hard questions, I left with serious doubts.\n\nThe program is a 12-month commitment that costs 5,000 dollars, currently discounted to 2,500. On top of that, they take a 10 percent revenue share from all consulting work you do during that time. When I asked if that included clients I bring in through my own network or cold calls, the answer got vague. It sounded like any work you do during the year still falls under their revenue share, which feels restrictive and unfair.\n\nYou also have to pay for your own AI tools. They mention having partnerships with platforms like Gumloop and Make.com, but those discounts don’t eliminate the cost. I asked how the backend works and who owns the CRM data. They never explained clearly, and I suspect they can use that information for their own analytics.\n\nI also brought up their low ScamDetector score, around 36 to 40, and they couldn’t explain it. When I asked to speak to a current or former member for proof of concept, they pushed back and said they only do that with “seriously interested” buyers. That’s not how trust-based selling works.\n\nI don’t think Stack.Expert is a scam, but it gives off pyramid-scheme vibes. The model itself makes sense, but the lack of transparency kills it. Trust matters more than ever in this space, and they didn’t earn mine. If anyone considers joining, hire a lawyer first and clarify:\n\t1.\tWhether you can work with your own clients independently.\n\t2.\tHow your data is used and stored.\n\t3.\tWhat happens after the 12-month period.\n\nGood idea, poor execution. Proceed with caution.\n",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Cline has launched their own CLI and sub-agents feature, and I thought that I'd talk about this as well. Cline has been missing in action for a while now. Their updates have been a bit slow, and that gap was taken up by things like Roo, which also got a bit slow. And now, it's been taken up by Kilo, and they've been doing really good work. Like, a blatant example of this is that Haiku, the new model by Anthropic, doesn't work either with Cline or Roo because for some reason, Haiku just doesn't work with prompt-based tool calling. It needs native tool calling within the API request. Cline and Roo still haven't implemented it, but Kilo already has it, and they're the first to do so. So, yeah, you get the point. Cline has become like the Red Hat of Linux, which is now more geared towards enterprises, something I didn't really use it for. Anyway, they've been refactoring things, making it more extensible by bifurcating the back-end and front-end of the extension. That's also what allowed them to create their JetBrains plugin and stuff like that. So, because this has been bifurcated, they are now able to also make a CLI over the same agentic framework that Cline uses. Their CLI is more geared towards people who want to implement Cline into something like a CI or CD workflow, but you can still use it locally. It gives you the same capabilities that Cline does because it uses the same agentic system in the back-end. This allows you to integrate it into things like Slack, Discord, CI or CD workflows, and things like that as well. So, basically, you can build remote coding agents and integrate them into a ton of places. They say you can run parallel Clines to tackle multiple GitHub issues at once, build Slack bots, GitHub Actions, or mobile apps on top, and even start tasks in the terminal, and continue in your IDE with the same state. Yes, this is one of the things I really liked. The fact that it almost syncs across the terminal and VS Code states, which is pretty great. Another thing that they've launched with this is that Cline's VS Code extension can now also spawn multiple sub-agents that can get tasks done for you. This is very similar to how the sub-agents in Claude Code work. You give it a task, and it can orchestrate multiple sub-agents to achieve that task for you, which is pretty great if you ask me. I think Roo already had the orchestrator mode for this for a while now, but this is much more fleshed out, and a tad bit faster as well. Now, let's get into it and check this out too. You can install Cline in your terminal quite easily with a command. Then you'll have to run it with the `cline` command, and it'll get started. At first, it'll ask you to set up a provider, so set it up accordingly. If you want to change it later down the line, then you can also set it up with the `cline auth` command, which should open up the provider options, and you can add a new provider there and stuff like that. Then, we can go ahead and start using it accordingly. The interface here is nothing extraordinary. It's pretty simple. You can just send a message, and it'll get started on it. It starts in the plan mode, which is an interesting choice, but you can change it with the `/act` command, and that will switch it to act mode, which is great. You can also hit `Ctrl` + `E` to open an editor and write your prompt there, which is cool. It's very similar to how Cline's VS Code counterpart works, so I won't go too deep into that. There are three or four major sub-commands as well, and let me tell you about them. First of all, you can start a Cline instance with the `cline` command along with your task. And there are also some flags. Like, there's the `o` flag for one-shot full autonomous mode. There's also `y` for YOLO mode, allowing you to enable fully autonomous mode as well. `v` is for verbose, and you can also set the mode via the mode flag. There are also some little things here and there, but I won't talk about them as much. Now, let's look at the Cline sub-agents feature as well. You'll have to head on over to VS Code and make sure you've updated Cline to the latest version. Now, go to the settings and in the feature settings, just enable the sub-agents feature. This requires you to have the Cline CLI installed as well. Without that, it won't work because it basically runs the terminal Cline CLI to spin up multiple instances, which is pretty great if you ask me. After enabling this, you can go ahead and ask it to spawn multiple sub-agents for whatever task you want and stuff like that. It'll also do it on its own when needed. I won't go into too much depth about this either, because it's basically just Cline, but in a sub-agent config. I really like it because it works pretty well. This is probably one of the major updates in the last three or six months or something like that. So, yeah, I like these updates. The CLI agent is something I've been looking forward to for a while now, and this is a really good update for sure. There aren't a ton of updates, but Cline is a bit faster and less memory hungry these days because of the whole bifurcation thing. And we'll see how well the updates go after this. There hasn't been any major feature in the last six months, if I remember correctly. So, this is good to see. One feature that I really liked is that if you use a local model, you get a compact system prompt option, which is a really good addition for local models. I saw it just here. Anyway, I'll still be using Kilo because their features are really good, and most of that stuff was already there. The autocomplete there has also made me switch over. So, yeah, I'll keep using it. But this is also pretty great. So, I hope that we get something new here, soon as these stuff is new to Cline. But has been existing for a while in other tools now. It almost makes Cline feel like a legacy tool at this point. They used to really innovate on new features, but it doesn't seem the case anymore. So, I hope that this period of them making their codebase better pays off in the long-term, and I hope that we get some new and great updates as well. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
