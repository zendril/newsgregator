### Research Breakthroughs & Significant Findings
*   **New AI Cognition Framework (MLC–ELM Model):** A formal framework for cognitive architectures, the MLC–ELM Model from Principia Cognitia, has been published as an open preprint. This work distinguishes internal vector-based cognition (MLC) from external symbolic expression (ELM) and connects transformer LLM dynamics with empirical neuroscience, proposing "semions" as cognitive primitives.
