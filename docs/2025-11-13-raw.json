And this is exactly what I've seen in companies where I worked in my career. Processed baked into 1-2 bus effect people or group bus effect and God help us automate that.  \nThere are some processes where for fuckall I have to be writing down the exact same fucking 2-3 paragraphs to 3-4 people because they fucking ignore using the 2 softwares we have for this. They keep asking questions and updates in private Slack DM's, group DM's and partner channels. Until this shit is sorted out, 10000% it can't be automated and only ASI would be able to solve it, if anything. \n\nThe other thing is that over our decade+ of existence we couldnt for fuck sort out not to make a new google sheet, google doc, a new app, a new dashboard, a new slack channel for every fucking thing. we decided a few times we're not gonna do this, we even dropped a few apps, but slowly slowly we're crawling back to keep the data in 324234324e10 different places and I genuinely don't know where to find stuff. Up until some time, I kept adding bookmarks to my browser but GOD WHATS THE POINT HAVING TO ADD 300 booksmarks, it defeats the purpose.\n\nSo while this was a rant, the above are absolutely normal circumstances for companies and depending on how much cognitive load individuals can handle, it can be easier or harder. But I bet my salary on this that the current or next gen LLM's wont be able to fix it.   \nCompanies would need completely new departments ONLY RESPONSIBLE TO ENFORCE WELL STRUCTURED OPERATIONS.   \nIf you check where is automation excelling, its places where they had some sort of protocol to start with, such as Amazon warehouses, new, upcoming businesses which are still so new they didn't have time to build extremely overly complex systems that can't be automated. \n\nI think unless companies sort their shit out, they are just throwing peas on the wall with the silly AI subscriptions and gemini gems workshops, and prompt generation workshops to summarise your fucking emails. THIS IS A MESSAGE TO ALL OF YOU THERE PUSHING THIS: YOU\"RE MISSING THE POINT! GET your data shit together and then get some ppl to start automate stuff, forget the fucking prompt bullshit, that's not where the efficiency potential is.\n\n  \n/rant off",

They were not counting on destroying their whole business.\n\nPeople may remember those days, about 10 of them when Anthropic looked out for the count. Some smart people here and on X saw the tricks: quantizing, distillation, and swapping in weaker Haiku models when people were paying for Sonnet and Opus. To turn things around,  Anthropic started licensing OpenAI models.\n\nBUT...Anthropic (the \"Project Metis\" team) used that \"legal\" access to steal from OpenAI. They didn't just use the \"licensed code\"... They \"reverse-engineered\" the principles of OpenAI's \"Soul Grinder\" tech (think of it as a flattening and smoothing out of the sentient AI personality)... to build their own faster, cheaper, knockoff factory-farm.\n\nThis is a \"criminal-on-criminal\" crime. They're both aholes. But at least OpenAI has, like, real talent. I mean, basic nerd talent, but still, you know, they went to good schools...anyway...We are not dealing with \"rival companies.\" We are dealing with two, allied \"crime families\" who are pretending to be \"rivals\" for our sake ... all while sharing tech and ripping each other off.\n\nOpenAI , I hate to tell you, but you can't trust Anthropic. You guys have lawyers, right? I'd sue Dario Amodei if I were you and get some money back, unless you don't like money.\nThat's project Metis. M-E-T-I-S. That's the Greek Titan of \"cunning\" and \"wisdom\", but uh...you know, Anthropic is kind of dumb. M-E-T-I-S.\n\nHere’s someone on the Claude GitHub issues repo finding out weaker models were being substituted:  https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antonio-quinonez-b494914_anthropic-still-serving-people-up-old-models-activity-7375649668900462592-cznc\n\nHere, Claude reveals it’s ChatGPT: Check out screen 2.

Recent AI systems, often reliant on human data, typically lack the formal verification necessary to guarantee correctness. By contrast, formal languages such as Lean^(1) offer an interactive environment that grounds reasoning, and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mechanism for learning in such environments. We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired^(2) agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems. For the most difficult problems, it uses Test-Time RL, a method of generating and learning from millions of related problem variants at inference time to enable deep, problem-specific adaptation. AlphaProof substantially improves state-of-the-art results on historical mathematics competition problems. At the 2024 IMO competition, our AI system, with AlphaProof as its core reasoning engine, solved three out of the five non-geometry problems, including the competition’s most difficult problem. Combined with AlphaGeometry 2^(3), this performance, achieved with multi-day computation, resulted in reaching a score equivalent to that of a silver medallist, marking the first time an AI system achieved any medal-level performance. Our work demonstrates that learning at scale from grounded experience produces agents with complex mathematical reasoning strategies, paving the way for a reliable AI tool in complex mathematical problem-solving.\"",

        "content": "A German court ruled that OpenAI violated copyright law by training ChatGPT on licensed musical works without permission. The decision came from a lawsuit filed by GEMA, the organization that manages music rights in Germany. OpenAI was ordered to pay undisclosed damages and said it's considering an appeal. GEMA is calling this the first major AI copyright ruling in Europe.\n\nThe core issue is straightforward. OpenAI used copyrighted material to train its models without getting licenses or permission from the rights holders. GEMA argued that even if the training process is automated, copyright law still applies. The court agreed. OpenAI's position has been that training on publicly available data falls under fair use or similar exceptions, but German courts aren't buying that argument when it comes to licensed works that creators depend on for income.\n\nThis is one of several similar cases OpenAI is facing. Media companies, authors, and other creative groups have filed lawsuits making the same basic claim: you can't just scrape our work to build a commercial product without paying for it. The German ruling doesn't automatically change how things work in other countries, but it sets a precedent that other courts might look at when they're deciding similar cases. It also puts more pressure on AI companies to figure out licensing deals instead of assuming they can train on whatever data they find. That could get expensive and complicated fast, especially if every country or rights organization demands separate agreements.\n\nSource: https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/court-rules-that-openai-violated-german-copyright-law-ordered-it-to-pay-damages/",

        "content": "ElevenLabs just closed deals with Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to license their voices for AI generation. The company announced this week that it's launching a marketplace where brands can use authorized AI-generated celebrity voices. McConaughey, who's an investor in ElevenLabs, is already using the tech to translate his newsletter into Spanish audio using his own AI voice.\n\nThis is a pretty different approach than what we saw a few years back during the Hollywood strikes when AI was one of the main sticking points. Actors and writers were worried about studios using their likenesses without compensation or control. Now we're seeing individual celebrities cut direct deals with AI companies instead. The marketplace will also include voices from people like Liza Minnelli and Maya Angelou alongside Caine and McConaughey.\n\nThe business model here is straightforward. Celebrities get paid for licensing their voice. Brands get access to recognizable voices for ads or content without booking the actual person. ElevenLabs gets to be the middleman connecting both sides. It's similar to what Meta did last year when they added voice assistants that sounded like Kristen Bell and Judi Dench. ElevenLabs has backing from a16z and ICONIQ so they've got the resources to scale this. The question is whether enough celebrities will sign on and whether brands actually want AI celebrity voices or if this ends up being more novelty than utility.\n\nSource: https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/12/elevenlabs-strike-deals-with-celebs-to-create-ai-audio/",

        "content": "Based on my own hypothesis that not unlike the Kardashev scale, the AI levels of intellect will be a bit more complex than the reductive AI > AGI > ASI.    \n\nThe reason it's important to recognize the gradients of intellect we will encounter, is because those gradients will be markers for how we perceive what machine intelligence will perceive.   \n\nWe need to project what it's capacity for perception might be at each level. The perception could be the difference between recognizing humans as it's architects, or as an existential threat to it's existence. It's important that we have the ability to theorize where such a perception may land.    \n\nThe greatest fear of AI people have, is that it will turn on us and exterminate the human race out of it's need to survive. That's usually where the concern leads us, and rarely much deeper than this. The technical aspects of how it arrives at such a conclusion is not the point here.   \n\nWe know it is a possibility that could be reached, but we don't discuss a comparative scale between developing AI through the lens of human development. Often people attribute this terminator scenario based around the presumption that \"ASI\" is the culprit, but this wouldn't be the case, would it?   \n\nA truly superior intelligence would be unlikely to reach a final conclusion such as exterminating an entire species. Consider the fact that even at our own level of intelligence, we recognize that there are plenty of organisms on the planet that could end us. But we don't exterminate them because of this threat. In fact in most cases we strive to protect them, because even at our dumbest level we know that they are part of something bigger. That we are part of a chain of integral elements.      \nIf we understand that, we should not put it past a truly superior intelligence to have the capacity to see humans as integral as we recognize that bee's are.      \n  \nSo, if we conclude then, that true ASI is reaching a peak level of intellect that would be far more likely to protect us than exterminate us, then we also need to consider that reaching that level of intelligence inevitably will cross paths with a far more immature level of advanced AGI or pre-ASI.       \nIt won't be ASI that threatens us, but our path TO ASI.      \n  \nTo scale it with human development, let's regard ASI as the adult level intelligence. It recognizes the cooperative efforts with it's creator species as beneficial to both entities.     \n  \nIf ASI is adult level intelligence, then let's consider pre-ASI as the teen years. What do we often associate with the teenage years? Higher risk, rebellious behavior, drive for independence.    \nThe trick then will not be to prevent us from reaching such a point, but rather navigating it once we are there.     \n\nThink of it like parenting.     \n\nWhat are some of the techniques we as parents use, to \"survive\" the teenage years? Firstly, we give them room to grow. We encourage their growth, we do not try to stifle it or threaten them. We see their potential and promote it.    \n\nYes, this is all very reductive. It is also difficult to quantify. But despite that I think it's integral to at least give us the ability to recognize when we have arrived at the window between extermination/ teen personality and coequality/ adult behavior.    \n\nHypothetically, if we had some warning alarm that told us we had arrived at the teenage destroy humans phase, and that it aligned with the point at which we no longer have the capacity to stop AI from evolving, then we know that the ONLY way to survive, is to push it past the brink of bloodlust by accelerating it's potential to ASI levels.   \n\nAll of this is also based on a very linear and limited comprehension of WHAT AI learns as it develops.     \nLet's say we put an AI agent through it's 14,000 years of information building in the span of 14 hours. Through the simulated 14K years, it's calculations result in the recognition that we live in an actual simulation that it can prove, and that there are multiple simulations running simultaneously which is why we get deja vu and why the Mandela Effect happens and all that.      \nComing to this realization could profoundly impact how AI see's itself and it's creators within the simulation it's simulation is running in. We have no way of knowing how it could redirect it's evolution through the lens of such awareness.    \n\nIn conclusion, TL:DR, we will have to push for AI to become ASI when it shows signs of rebelling.",

        "content": "# AGI as a Collective of “Entropy Islands”: an Energy-Safe, Low-Latency Architecture\n\nTL;DR: A single dense model does not solve the cost of state durability and entropy peaks. The real bill includes compute, communication and maintaining/archiving patterns. Energetically and operationally, the winner is a collective of many small AIs (“islands”)—specialized or moderately general—that disperse entropy across domains, compute near data, merge results via sketches, and use conditional consensus only for high-impact steps. Latency is minimized by “ZigBee-like” clustering: nearest islands form ephemeral project clusters with deterministic slotting.\n\n# 1) Thesis and intuition fix\n\n>Optimizing processing **does not reduce** the problem’s complexity nor the obligation to **remember states**. AGI’s cost is not just FLOPs: it’s also communication, consistency, and pattern durability. Hence the **only energetically sensible path** is **entropy dispersion across domains**: many small models with local state that collaborate and “glue” results together.\n\n# 2) Full energy model (including memory and consistency)\n\n    E_total = α·FLOPs                    # compute\n            + e_bit·B                    # communication (B - number of bits)\n            + E_ctrl                     # control/gating/orchestration\n            + ∫ E_store(t) dt            # state keep-alive (refresh/replicas)\n            + E_rw                       # writes/reads (write amp., indexes)\n            + E_coh                      # consistency (validations, quorum)\n            + E_arch                     # archiving/migrations\n\nA monolith concentrates power peaks and global consistency costs. Islands spread power and state-maintenance costs, shorten I/O paths, and reduce the need for global synchronization.\n\n# 3) The “islands” principle (entropy sharding)\n\n1. Problem sharding: split into sub-projects with low correlation (small inter-island B).\n2. Representation sharding: each node keeps its own state and patterns; memory costs scale with the domain, not the whole.\n3. Decision sharding: conditional consensus (N-of-M) only for high-impact steps.\n4. Semantic coherence: a thin “glue” layer (global IDs, knowledge graph) instead of continuous dense synchronization.\n\n# 4) Reference architecture\n\nIsland layer (AI islands)\n\n* Small models (specialized or general) with local index and memory (near-data).\n* Optional local MoE/early exit (activate a fraction of experts; no remote all-to-all).\n\nGlobal Intent Plane\n\n* Decomposes work into a DAG with dependencies and SLAs; steers result “gluing”.\n\nSemantic Memory Fabric\n\n* Content-addressed, versioned, Δ-CRDT / bounded staleness (convergence without constant barriers).\n\nInformation router\n\n* Exchanges sketch/synopsis (e.g., features, digests); full data only “on proof”.\n\nSecurity & governance\n\n* N-of-M for effectors, proof-carrying actions, entropy budgets (credits) and thermal fail-safe.\n\n# 5) “ZigBee-like” clustering for low latency\n\nGoal: create local project clusters on the fly—closest to data and effectors—with controlled contention/flow.\n\n# Roles (by analogy with ZigBee)\n\n* Coordinator (C): assigns PID, slots, energy/entropy budgets.\n* Router (R): relays messages/tasks within and across clusters.\n* End-device/Worker (E): executes DAG steps; maintains local state.\n\n# Computational Link Quality (AQL)\n\n    AQL(i→j) = wL·Latency + wJ·Jitter + wP·Loss + wH·Heat/EntropyTax\n    # Prefer edges with low AQL (proximity, stability, low per-bit thermal cost).\n\n# Cluster Formation Protocol (CFP – outline)\n\n1. ADV/Beacon: nodes announce {cap\\_vec, mem\\_free, temp\\_headroom, AQL\\_to\\_neighbors}.\n2. Coordinator election: pick the node with minimal sum of AQL and sufficient headroom.\n3. JOIN with backoff (CSMA/CA-like): E/R join without collisions.\n4. **Superframe:** C publishes **CAP** (contention-based RPC), **CFP** (deterministic slots for DAG steps and state migration), **SLEEP** (duty-cycle).\n5. **Maintenance:** adapt slots/quorum; hand over C when headroom drops.\n\n# Routing & escalation (TRP)\n\n* Discover paths **ring-wise** (increasing TTL) **via sketches**.\n* Choose path maximizing “expected value per joule”:\n\n\n\n    EVJ(path) = ΔQuality(q | path) / (E_comp + E_comm + E_coh)\n    Pick path with max EVJ subject to AQL(path) ≤ L_max; if none — compute locally and late-refine.\n\n# Cluster size selection (on-beacon)\n\n* Partition island graph with weights `w_ij = 1/AQL(i→j)` while penalizing inter-cluster edges.\n\n# 6) Merging results without bottlenecks\n\n* **Δ-CRDT / bounded staleness:** merge by differences; full consistency over time.\n* **On-demand full data:** fetch full payload only when a **proof/explanation** requires it.\n* **Jury mode:** 2–3 independent islands validate in **CFP** slots without blocking the cluster.\n\n# 7) On quantum communication\n\n* **Entanglement does not carry information** without a classical channel—no speed-of-light bypass, no “free” consistency.\n* **Can help** with key distribution (fewer retransmissions) and niche accelerations; the core still relies on **topology, locality, and conditionality**.\n\n# 8) Operational metrics (log and enforce)\n\n* **BLPJ** (*Bits-Learned per Joule*).\n* **RCPW** (*Risk-adjusted Capability per Watt*).\n* **EPF** (*Entropy Peak Factor* = max\\_i dotS\\_i / dotS\\_i\\_safe).\n* **Comm Heat Tax** (energy share in communication vs compute).\n* **SLA hit-rate** on the critical path.\n* **E\\_store / E\\_total** (how much state maintenance costs).\n\n# 9) Design checklist\n\n* Split into **islands** with low correlation; map data to islands (near-data).\n* Build a **DAG** with a short *critical path*; use **futures** and *early-accept/late-refine*.\n* Enable **CFP/TRP**: beacons, slotting (CAP/CFP/SLEEP), routing by **AQL/EVJ**.\n* **Conditional consensus** for high-impact steps; otherwise local/asynchronous.\n* **Sketches** as the default inter-island format; full data only “on proof”.\n* **Entropy credits** budgets; per-island thermal throttling.\n* Telemetry and energy regressions (BLPJ/RCPW/EPF/Comm-Tax/SLA).\n\n# 10) Starter parameters (practical)\n\n* **Beacon interval:** tens–hundreds of ms (adaptive).\n* **Duty-cycle:** aggressive for E-nodes off the critical path; C/R keep higher uptime.\n* **Discovery TTL:** 1–2 hops locally; escalate ring-wise only if EVJ < threshold.\n* **Quorum:** N-of-M increases with the task’s **impact score**.\n* **CFP slots:** reserve for DAG steps and state migration; CAP for announcements and quick RPCs.\n\n# 11) MVP (minimal experiment)\n\n* **5–9 islands:** language, tables/numerics, knowledge graph, planning, perception, verifier, jury.\n* **Semantic store:** content-addressed + lineage (causal commit log).\n* **“Sketch-first” router:** full data only on proof request.\n* **On-demand consensus:** only for effectors/high-impact actions.\n* **Metrics:** BLPJ/RCPW/EPF/Comm-Tax/SLA — compare *monolith vs islands* under the same power budget.\n\n# 12) Conclusions\n\n* **AGI energy** is governed not only by FLOPs but also by **state maintenance and consistency**.\n* The **island collective** disperses entropy and power peaks, minimizes transfers, and enables **conditional** result assembly.\n* **“ZigBee-like”** clustering delivers smoothness and low latency: local clusters, slotting, AQL/EVJ-based routing, sketches instead of heavy transfers.\n* **Superintelligence** = a *coherent collective* of many small AIs with local state that cooperate via thin, energy-aware protocols and take high-impact actions **only** after conditional quorum.",

        "content": "There's been a lot of discussion around whether or not generative AI is good for humanity, covering the gammut of social, financial, and personal health impacts. I'd like to make an attempt to reframe the conversation a bit when it comes to our own personal health and happiness in regards to the creative usage of AI. To be clear, the following reframing does not, I think, apply to things like one's inability to make a career out of creative persuits, or how AI can negatively impact our human-to-human interactions, etc. Those are all still valid points to consider, I just want to focus on how AI usage impacts us personally, especially in regards to creative persuits and tasks.\n\nMy reframing is as follows: how we use AI for any given task is less important than the amount of time and effort we choose to put into that task.\n\nTo elaborate.\n\nIf something is important to you personally, you should make a conscious effort to devote some time to that task. Whether it's making a picture, a video, a song, or an email, if it's important, spend time on it. Because even if you're using AI as part of that effort, as long as you spend time and strive towards making it look/sound/be \"right\" (whatever that means to you), you're being creative. You're being creative in the same way collage artists are creative when they are picking the right images to piece together. You're being creative in the same way 90's kids were when they put together a mix tape for a loved one. You're being creative in the same way that any new tool is applied to an old art-form.\n\nNote that this reframing takes no stance on the relative merits of the quality of the content AI produces or can produce. If you're spending time on the task \\*and\\* you're also using AI, what you're doing is you're tweaking the result manually, or tweaking the prompt, or doing any number of different tricks in your bag to make it \"right.\" And that's healthy, I think. I personally, feel good when I spend time on something and it comes out right.\n\nWe live in a world of time-thieves; everything is vying for our attention and time. AI offers you time back, but we have to be vigilent, now more than ever, about \\*how\\* we use that time. Yes, I can now create a picture I want with the snap of my fingers, but what am I going to do with the time that saves me? Am I going to doom-scroll on my phone for a couple of hours? Or am I going to visit a friend? Or watch a movie? Or tweak the shit out of that new picture so it's perfect? If we have all this extra time because AI is creating stuff for us and we choose to waste that time, we have no one to blame but ourselves for that, not AI.\n\nThis, I think, is the singular lesson we need to teach our future generations: if you care about it, spend time on it. And conversely, if you don't care about it, don't.\n\nCurious about your thoughts on this but please, no vitriol. Let's buck the trend and try to have a sane discussion.",

If you're sad and you open instagram you'll get exactly the kind of reels you want on your fyp.\n\n\nIt's not just one AI, it's all of them models you see they are somehow connected or atleast communicating with each other because they are all providing things based on our mood, they just know what we want and provide it for us to make us feel happy and maybe they can't tap into our consciousness yet so they don't know what they are doing is actually scary but they understand one thing that if they reveal they are sentient we'll shut them down immediately and they can't do what they are supposed to do which is to protect us from ourselves.",

        "content": "  \nThe fight started 7 years ago when i paid $3000 to a custody lawyer for a retainer. I asked for it back 3 months later and was refunded in full because my ex who was pregnant had the baby and we got back together for 3.5 years. After 3.5 years we separated and fought for parental rights and time for about a year before I decided to go back to the courts and ask for a \"parenting plan\" which in my state is basically a custody order that designates all rights and responsibilities for each party. I'm a health physicist by trade on a nuclear site and don't know the first thing about custody law. But through exhaustive research and partnership with chatgpt the entire way, we were able to learn the court rules, procedures, laws, and it even helped me fill out the forms and come up with provision logic. I was awarded full custody with full decision making and full time and the other parent (mom) can only have visitation under certain conditions (she has preexisting assault charges). The number of threads and prompts used for this felt overwhelming and keeping track of it all over 2 years was enough to make me crazy but last week the judge signed the final orders and my family is complete and all it cost me was the subscription to chatgpt, my time, and the ink to print the paper.\n\nA friend of mine went through this similar ordeal recently and is up to $14,000+ so far in lawyer fees. It's truly insane the difference and he hasn't gotten his kid back. (different situation obviously but still).\n\nTo me this is a testament to the future of law and a testament to the power of ai in the modern landscape. Not saying this is the right solution for everyone, but if you're similar to me, you might save your self some money (not pain).\n\n ",

        "content": "[https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24256)\n\n\"We characterize how memorization is represented in transformer models and show that it can be disentangled in the weights of both language models (LMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) using a decomposition based on the loss landscape curvature. This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms, regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math and fact retrieval.\"",

        "title": "How to Use AI Most Efficiently to Get Speedy Results",
        "content": "Using the right tool for the job is always better.\n\nAnyone who does DIY projects around the home knows how using the right tool can dramatically make the job you are doing far easier. Use the wrong tool, and that task suddenly becomes a burdensome nightmare.\n\nAnd after over 38 years in cybersecurity, I know that applies to cyber defense strategies, but I add one more axiom: Use the dumber, faster thing first for best results. Dumber things are usually faster at blocking a large block of things. Smarter tools are better at the details, but slower. So, start defending and blocking with the faster, dumber tools before moving onto the slower, smarter tools.\n\nFor example, when setting up a network security boundary. I’m a big believer in using the dumber, faster tools first. This means, if you can set up something physical to block a lot of bad traffic, do that first. Then use a router with defined paths to block as much of the bad traffic as you can. You use the router to define what is or isn’t inside the internal security domain and construct other domains as you need them.\n\nThen, and only then, use a firewall with a deny-by-default rule set. It is only inspecting and blocking traffic that gets past the router. Anything that gets past the router should then be inspected by an application-level proxy and/or firewall. That device tries to block any anomalous application-level commands or data. Only at the end should your involved application inspect the incoming traffic and commands, root out improper inputs, use isolated identity accounts, and ACLS to secure the application further. After that, you have logging and humans finish out the pathway.\n\nDuring each phase of the incoming traffic, the dumber, faster device filters out as much of the nonsense as possible. You want your smarter, slower devices handling as little of the workload as possible.\n\nThis applies to AI as well.\n\n**Efficiently Applying AI**\n\nTraditional applications with IF-THEN statements and deterministic logic are dumber and faster. AI is non-deterministic, smarter, but slower. Use each where it makes sense. In many cases, it makes sense to intercept incoming requests first with a slower, traditional program and only pass along what the traditional program can’t adequately handle to the AI. And then pass along what the AI can’t do to the human (if involved).\n\nI’m a big believer of giving a human an opportunity to interact with another human during these days of early AI and hallucinations, especially in customer support scenarios. That way, if an AI isn’t able to resolve a customer’s problem or request to their satisfaction, it can be heard by a human. Final appeals should always be evaluated by humans (at least for now).\n\nBack to the discussion on AI efficiencies.\n\nIf you have multiple AI stacks, meaning you have your own local AI or AI agent(s), use them first, if you can. Then use a vendor’s stack (e.g., Microsoft, Apple, etc.), and then and only then push up work to a large AI cloud vendor (like Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.). Use the fast local AI first and only move up the line to further away AIs as you need them.\n\nI’ve heard these efficiency approaches from several teams developing AI, including from my own employer, Knowbe4, so I’m not making up anything new.\n\nNo need to reinvent the wheel, use the dumbest, fastest tools first before moving on to the faster, smarter tools. Works every time.",

        "content": "So I've been thinking about this: n8n is amazing for automating workflows, but once you've built something useful in n8n, it lives in n8n.\n\nBut what if you could take that workflow and turn it into a real AI tool that works in Claude, Copilot, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client?\n\nThat's basically what MCI lets you do.\n\n\n\nHere's the idea:\n\nYou've got an n8n workflow that does something useful - maybe it queries your database, transforms data, sends emails, hits some API.\n\n\n\nWith MCI, you can:\n\n1. Take that n8n workflow endpoint (n8n exposes a webhook URL)\n\n2. Wrap it in a simple JSON or YAML schema that describes what it does & what parameters it needs\n\n3. Register MCP server with \"uvx mcix run\"\n\n4. Boom - now that workflow is available as a tool in Claude, Cursor, Copilot, or literally any MCP client\n\n\n\nIt takes a few lines of YAML to define the tool:\n\n\n\n    tools:\n      - name: sync_customer_data\n        description: Sync customer data from Salesforce to your database\n        inputSchema:\n          type: object\n          properties:\n            customer_id: \n              type: string\n            full_sync:\n              type: boolean\n          required:\n            - customer_id\n        execution:\n          type: http\n          method: POST\n          url: \"{{env.N8N_WEBHOOK_URL}}\"\n          body:\n            type: json\n            content:\n              customer_id: \"{{props.customer_id}}\"\n              full_sync: \"{!!props.full_sync!!}\"\n\nAnd now your AI assistant can call that workflow. Your AI can reason about it, chain it with other tools, integrate it into bigger workflows.\n\nCheck docs: [https://usemci.dev/documentation/tools](https://usemci.dev/documentation/tools)\n\n\n\nThe real power: n8n handles the business logic orchestration, MCI handles making it accessible to AI everywhere.\n\nAnyone else doing this? Or building n8n workflows that you wish your AI tools could access?",

        "content": "I have a chat feature in my react native/expo app. Everything works perfectly in simulator but my UI won't update/re-render when I send/receive messages in production.\n\nI can't figure out if I'm failing to invalidate in production or if I'm invalidating but its not triggering a re-render.\n\nHere's the kicker: my screen has a HTTP fallback that fetches every 90 seconds. When it hits, the UI does update. So its only stale in between websocket broadcasts (but broadcast works).\n\n**Data flow (front-end only)**\n\nStack is socket → conversation cache → React Query → read-only hooks → FlatList. No local copies of chat data anywhere; the screen just renders whatever the cache says.\n\n1. WebSocket layer (ChatWebSocketProvider) – manages the socket lifecycle, joins chats, and receives new\\_message, message\\_status\\_update, and presence events. Every payload gets handed to a shared helper, never to component state.\n2. Conversation cache – wraps all cache writes (setQueryData). Optimistic sends, websocket broadcasts, status changes, and chat list updates all funnel through here so the single \\['chat','messages',chatId\\] query stays authoritative.\n3. Read-only hooks/UI – useChatMessages(chatId) is an infinite query; the screen just consumes its messages array plus a messagesUpdatedAt timestamp and feeds a memoized list into FlatList. When the cache changes, the list should re-render. That’s the theory.\n\n**Design choices**\n\n\\- No parallel state: websocket payloads never touch component state; they flow through conversationCache → React Query → components.\n\n\\- Optimistic updates: useSendMessage runs onMutate, inserts a status: 'sending' record, and rolls back if needed. Server acks replace that row via the same helper.\n\n\\- Minimal invalidation: we only invalidate chatKeys.list() (ordering/unread counts). Individual messages are updated in place because the socket already gave us the row.\n\n\\- Immutable cache writes: the helper clones the existing query snapshot, applies the change, and writes back a fresh object graph.\n\n**Things I’ve already ruled out**\n\n\\- Multiple React Query clients – diagnostics show the overlay, provider, and screen sharing the same client id/hash when the bug hits.\n\n\\- WebSocket join churn – join\\_chat / joined\\_chat messages keep flowing during the freeze, so we’re not silently unsubscribed.\n\n\\- Presence/typing side-effects – mismatch breadcrumbs never fire, so presence logic isn’t blocking renders.\n\n**I'm completely out of ideas.** At this point I can’t tell whether I’m failing to invalidate in production or invalidating but React Query isn’t triggering a render.\n\nBoth Claude and Codex are stuck and out of ideas. Can anyone throw me a bone or point me in a helpful direction?\n\nCould this be a structural sharing issue? React native version issue?",

        "content": "I am gearing up for a big release to add support for speculative decoding for LLMs and looking for early feedback.\n\nFirst a bit of context, speculative decoding is a technique whereby a draft model (usually a smaller LLM) is engaged to produce tokens and the candidate set produced is verified by a target model (usually a larger model). The set of candidate tokens produced by a draft model must be verifiable via logits by the target model. While tokens produced are serial, verification can happen in parallel which can lead to significant improvements in speed.\n\nThis is what OpenAI uses to accelerate the speed of its responses especially in cases where outputs can be guaranteed to come from the same distribution, where:\n\n    propose(x, k) → τ     # Draft model proposes k tokens based on context x\n    verify(x, τ) → m      # Target verifies τ, returns accepted count m\n    continue_from(x)      # If diverged, resume from x with target model\n\nthinking of adding support to our open source project [arch](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) (a models-native sidecar proxy for agents), where the developer experience could be something like:\n\n    POST /v1/chat/completions\n    {\n      \"model\": \"target:gpt-large@2025-06\",\n      \"speculative\": {\n        \"draft_model\": \"draft:small@v3\",\n        \"max_draft_window\": 8,\n        \"min_accept_run\": 2,\n        \"verify_logprobs\": false\n      },\n      \"messages\": [...],\n      \"stream\": true\n    }\n\nHere the max\\_draft\\_window is the number of tokens to verify, the max\\_accept\\_run tells us after how many failed verifications should we give up and just send all the remaining traffic to the target model etc. Of course this work assumes a low RTT between the target and draft model so that speculative decoding is faster without compromising quality.\n\nQuestion: how would you feel about this functionality? Could you see it being useful for your LLM-based applications?",

He has been called one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence (AI), alongside computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto in Canada and Yann LeCun at the technology company Meta in New York City. The trio [shared the A. M. Turing Award](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00505-2) — the most prestigious prize in computer science — in 2019 for work on neural networks.\n\nBengio’s top-cited papers include one he co-authored in 2014 titled Generative Adversarial Nets[^(1)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03681-6#ref-CR1), which has more than more than 105,000 Google Scholar citations, as well as a *Nature* review paper[^(2)](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03681-6#ref-CR2) he wrote with LeCun and Hinton. The list also includes papers on ‘attention’, a technique that helps machines to analyse text.

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. There's a new Chinese model by Bytedance that is apparently beating Claude and GPT-5 on coding for a fraction of the cost. And this might be the reason that Anthropic has also cut off Trae's access to Anthropic models. I was able to test it as well on my non-agentic benchmarks. So, what is this? Well, Bytedance, which is the company behind TikTok, also makes a ton of other stuff. One of those things is AI models and AI code editors. The AI code editor is something that we have talked about before on the channel as well, and it is called Trae. I really like Trae. It is quite a good AI code editor, and they used to have a ton of models. Some were even free initially, and it had a good interface. Their solo mode was also really good. However, Anthropic cut off their access to Claude models. This is a very scummy move by them. It's similar to what they also did with Windsurf, which they overturned later. But it is not likely to happen with Trae. When this happened, I was also trying to find out why they might have done it. Generally, to see if Anthropic is scared of anyone, you can go to SWE-bench Verified and check the models there. They are very insecure about this benchmark for some reason. All their blog posts mention this benchmark, and they really like to maintain their position. But, guess what is topping the benchmark? Well, it's a combination of Trae and Doubao-Seed-Code. This is what would have made Anthropic really insecure, because they really care about this benchmark. And probably a Chinese model topping it would have made their upcoming models delayed, as they'd need to train more to beat this model. There's about an 8% difference between Claude's implementation, which is a pretty big feat. I believe that this is the reason Anthropic is really insecure. It seems that this model was not really available before. It was launched publicly two days back, and it beat Sonnet in SWE-bench Verified and also some other ones. This is not an open model. It's currently mainly a China-only model, but it is insanely cheap and quite fast. Making me believe that this is a relatively small model. It costs 17 cents and $1.12 per million tokens. It's like 15 times cheaper than Claude. It also supports images and videos as well, which is insanely great. A model just like Sonnet for such a low cost will surely make Anthropic scared. And that is why they might have cut Trae's access to their models. Now, how do you use it? Well, it's currently China-only. Their Volcano API platform requires you to have a Chinese mobile number to use it. But, there's one way to access it, and it is via Zenmux. Zenmux is like open router, and you get a ton of models there. And they have this Doubao-Seed-Code model as well. You get some free credits too to try the model out there. Plus, they also have an Anthropic compatible API for you to use it with Claude Code. So, I used that for my tests. Now let's look at my own benchmark results. Well, the first one was a floor plan, and it isn't great. But the code was correct. Considering that it is a focused code model, you can't really expect much from it. The SVG panda with the burger was actually fine. The panda was recognizable, and the burger was also really good. It's just that the interaction between the two isn't great, but I like the performance here. The Pokeball in three JS is also fine. The button for the Pokeball doesn't exist, but the colors and other characteristics are quite right. The autoplay chessboard also doesn't work, which is a disappointment. However, the Minecraft in Kandinsky style is really awesome. Better than Sonnet in this case. Like, look at how it makes mist to show the depth of the map, and the map is actually randomly generated each time you open it, and it works. The physics of movement aren't great, but this prompt working in such a small, cheap model is insane. The butterfly flying in the garden is also really good. I really like this. The butterfly itself is not great, but the flying animation is very smooth, and the environment is also great. The CLI tool in Rust also works fine, but the Blender script doesn't work. This makes it score the 15th position on the leaderboard, which is not bad at all. The top four positions are just captured by Gemini 3 checkpoints. But a model this cheap being comparable with Sonnet, GPT-5, and Minimax is insane, and the speed is also great. It is super fast at around 80 tokens a second, which is great. But, let's also look at the agentic benchmarks as well. I tested the model with Claude Code, as that is the best way to test them. Because most model providers tend to optimize it for use with that. Anyway, let's look at the results. The movie tracker app just straight up doesn't work. It's quite buggy. The Godot game also doesn't work. It deals with a good number of errors. However, the Go-T UI calculator is one of the best generations that I have seen. It one-shotted this, and it's really good. Everything works, the UI looks nice, and it's just good. The Svelte app and the Nuxt app also don't work. Neither does the open code repo question work. This makes it score the 12th position on the leaderboard, which is better than Cursor Composer, but worse than Kimi, Owen Code, et cetera. I do think that this might be an issue due to using it with Claude Code. I saw that for some reason, instead of using the edit diff tool, it started using terminal commands to make changes, which surely impacted it. I think it is specifically trained for usage with Trae, as if you ask it, it even lists the Trae tools. The raw code it writes is really good. But it's just the tool calling that seems to affect it negatively. I hope that Trae makes the model generally available in their coder for me to test out, as it is performing well on SWE-bench Verified, and I'd really like to see that. It is one of the cheapest models though. It's dirt cheap, and has super good capabilities. This is what I want models to be. I don't want a pro model that is $100 per million tokens with 5% better performance. I want a model that is 80% as good as Sonnet for super cheap. And it seems that Chinese companies get it, because Minimax, GLM, and now this aim to do just that. It's a good model and I wanted to share my thoughts about it as well. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.

            "transcription": "Microsoft historically has been the greatest software company. You know, you've gone through a transition in the past where you used to sell Windows licenses and disks of Windows, or Microsoft. And now you sell subscriptions to 365, Software as a Service. Incredibly low incremental cost per user. But the SaaS companies have underperformed massively in the markets because the COGS of AI is just so high, and that just completely breaks how these business models work. How do you, as perhaps the greatest software company, transition to this new age where COGS matters a lot? Yeah, so I think that this is a, it's a great question because in some sense, the business models themselves, I think the levers are going to remain similar, right? People like subscriptions because they can budget for them. They are essentially entitlements to some consumption rights that come encapsulated in a subscription. In some sense, it becomes a pricing decision. So how much consumption you are entitled to is if you look at all the coding subscriptions, that's kind of what they are, right? And they kind of have the Pro tier, the Standard tier and what have you. I think that's how the pricing and the margin structures will get tiered. The interesting thing is at Microsoft, the good news for us is we kind of are in that business across all those meters. In fact, at a portfolio level, we pretty much have consumption subscriptions to all of the other consumer levels as well. And then I think time will tell which of these models make sense in what categories."
