        "content": "Lately, I’ve been noticing an interesting divide: even within **paid AI tiers**, there seems to be a split between lower-tier and higher-tier subscribers.\n\nFor instance, consider the classic $20‑vs‑$200 plans. While $20 might be sufficient for casual or occasional use, real power users—developers, entrepreneurs, power coders—often gravitate toward premium tiers like ChatGPT Pro ($200/mo), Gemini Ultra ($250/mo), Claude Max ($200/mo), or SuperGrok ($300/mo), even the constant Cursor Tier updates are a great example.\n\nThis seems like a **new hierarchy within paid access**:\n\n* **Lower paid tiers** still locked out of advanced features or compute.\n* **Mid-tier paid users** paying more but getting diminishing ROI.\n* **Top-tier corporate or enterprise users** with access to unthrottled usage, priority features, or custom support.\n\n# Discussion Points:\n\n* Is this tiered model creating a class system even among paying users?\n* How does this affect freelancers, students, and smaller businesses?\n* Are power users getting ripped off when plan benefits don’t scale with cost?\n* Are you concerned about Transparency on limits, pay-as-you-go models, or open-source alternatives?\n* How does it affect innovation, AI adoption and evolution and society?\n\n**Would love to hear your experiences:**\n\n* Have you felt limited even in premium plans?\n* Has your ROI decreased as tiers get more expensive but less flexible?\n* What would more equitable pricing look like in your view?\n\nAre you also realizing a division in AI Citizen? A clear division from 1st class and 2nd class AI users depending on the Tier model you can afford.",

        "content": "The most powerful person in Hollywood, hypothetically, is usually someone with deep control over content, influence, access to capital, and long-standing relationships—not necessarily a celebrity, but a person behind the scenes.\n\nAs of recent years, hypothetically speaking, a top contender would be:\n\n\n---\n\n🧠 David Zaslav (CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery)\n\nWhy he’s hypothetically one of the most powerful:\n\nControls massive media IP: DC (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman), HBO (Game of Thrones, Succession), Warner Bros. films, CNN, Discovery Channel.\n\nMerged companies: Engineered the $43 billion merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery.\n\nGreenlights or kills content: Canceled nearly completed projects (like Batgirl), which shocked the industry. That alone showed immense power.\n\nInfluences awards & perception: Has control over major Oscar-contending properties (Barbie, Dune), and can affect promotional budgets and campaign strategies.\n\nShaped streaming wars: Was a major player in deciding how HBO Max evolved—pivoting from streaming-first to profit-first.\n\nIndustry fear/respect: People either see him as a bold cost-cutter or a destroyer of creative risk, but either way, he can shift the direction of the entire industry.\n\n\n\n---\n\n🐍 Ari Emanuel (CEO of Endeavor, basis for Ari Gold in Entourage)\n\nWhat he's done:\n\nRepresents top talent: His agency (WME) represents A-listers across film, TV, sports, fashion.\n\nOwns UFC + WWE: His company (TKO Group) merged UFC and WWE, giving him combat sports dominance.\n\nNegotiates billion-dollar deals: Behind mega contracts for actors, directors, brands.\n\nControls access: He can make or break careers by deciding who gets represented or pushed forward.\n\nCulture power broker: Has hands in everything from film festivals to political influence.\n\n\n\n---\n\n🎥 Kevin Feige (President of Marvel Studios)\n\nAchievements:\n\nBuilt the MCU: Created the most successful cinematic universe in history ($29+ billion gross).\n\nPower of greenlight: If Feige approves your project, you get major funding, global exposure, and fan loyalty.\n\nShaped global culture: Characters like Iron Man, Black Panther, and Wanda Maximoff are now cultural icons.\n\nLong-term planning genius: Plotted 10+ years of films interconnected like TV episodes.\n\nMassive influence on genre: Entire studios try to copy his superhero model.\n\n\n\n---\n\n📺 Bonus Hypothetical Power Players:\n\nBob Iger (CEO, Disney): Reacquired as Disney’s CEO to stabilize streaming losses. Bought Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Fox—essentially assembled modern Hollywood.\n\nShonda Rhimes / Ryan Murphy: Showrunners who brokered $100M+ deals with Netflix, dictating what stories get told.\n\nOprah Winfrey: Owns OWN Network, helped launch others’ careers, has cultural influence far beyond just TV.\n\n\n\n---\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you're talking sheer industry power, it’s people like Zaslav, Iger, Emanuel, and Feige who shape Hollywood. They're not just rich—they decide what gets made, who gets to be a star, and how the public consumes culture. Their power lies in ownership, distribution, influence, and decision-making ability at scale.\n\nWant to go deeper into how any one of them operates?\n\n",

        "content": "Some people think LLMs aren't the future, LLMs won't progress to AGI etc. In reality it doesn't matter at all. Here are the top 4 reasons language models are going to stay with us, no matter what.\n\n# 1. They fulfill the original dream of computer scientists\n\nFrom the beginning, computing has aimed to make machines understand and carry out human instructions. In the early days, this meant programming in binary, jjust 0s and 1s. Then came assembly language, then high-level programming languages like Java, each step making computers easier to work with.\n\nToday, with AI systems that understand natural language, especially large language models (LLMs). We can describe what we want in plain English, and the machine responds accordingly. It’s a milestone in realizing a decades-old dream: to control computers simply by talking to them.\n\nThe progression in brief:\n\n* Binary (Machine language)\n* Assembly (Tiny instruction words)\n* High-level code (Closer to English)\n* Natural language (Just say what you want)\n\n# 2. Natural languages are progressing\n\nHumans think, speak, and write in natural language. Any AI system, whether today’s LLMs or tomorrow’s AGI, must understand our language to interact with us meaningfully. That fundamental requirement won’t change.\n\nNatural language is also fluid. It evolves through culture and context. Language-capable AIs like LLMs can adapt over time, learning new expressions, slang, and communication styles as humans do.\n\n# 3. Natural language bridges humans and complex AI systems\n\nLLMs and similar models don’t need to be AGI. Instead, they can serve as high-level interfaces, translating our intent into structured input for more specialized or powerful AI tools. This makes them the bridge between users and increasingly complex systems, without requiring us to understand the complexity underneath.\n\n# 4. Natural-language AIs enable communication with robots\n\nAs robots become part of daily life, whether in homes, hospitals, or factories, they’ll need to understand human speech, respond in kind, and interpret tone, intent, and context. Language models make this possible, providing a natural and intuitive layer of interaction between humans and machines.",

One of the rarer things they offered is midjourney and elevanlabs integration. They are currently still on their v2 (year old).\n\nPros:\n-They cover most every need from chat models to AV generative models.\n-Typically free models are free here too eg chatgpt 4o\n-Credits roll over\n\nCons:\n-Not necessarily the latest models eg missing chatgpt 4.1/4.5, Claude 4\n-Missing some key models eg Gemini, Deepseek, Perplexity, Grok, Sora, Cursor\n-Credits run out fast (typical for most offering this kind of service) eg 5-7 Midjourney pics and your 10 credits for the month gone\n-No mobile app\n-Poor support (have to contact during office hours otherwise your ticket is ignored even then slow response lol)\n-Need to sign up through referral link\n-No integrations\n\n\n\nIMHO it's nowhere near ready. \nOutdated and missing models. Non-existent support. Slow clunky performance.\n\n\nSigned up cause of some YouTube videos and that it had midjourney, flux and elevanlabs.\n\nCouldn't find any real reviews for it here either. \n\n\nMaybe if they improved on all their cons with an updated v3 release might be worth considering.\n\n\nOverall I would avoid for now.\n\n\nHope this helps.",

Shanghai Yingxun Technology Co., Ltd.*\n\nCase Number: (2019) Guangdong 0305MC Civil No. 14010\n\nCourt: Shenzhen Nanshan District People’s Court\n\nFiled: May 24, 2019\n\nRuling Date: December 24, 2019\n\nMain claim type and allegation: Copyright; plaintiff alleged defendant copied plaintiff’s article containing stock market data and information onto defendant’s website without plaintiff’s permission or compensation\n\nThe article at issue was generated by an AI writing assistant bot called “Dreamwriter,” and it carried a disclaimer that it was  “automatically written by Tencent Robot Dreamwriter.” It was generated by Dreamwriter within two minutes of the financial market’s close, but required human involvement. A human team ran the Dreamwriter system and prepared inputs to the system including data formatting, data input, templates, and training of the proofreading algorithm\n\nThe court found that the choices and arrangement of the group operating the Dreamwriter system determined the expression that resulted within the article and the AI algorithm merely gave technical effect to the group’s creative work. The fact that there was a time lag between the human input and the expression resulting from that input was not disqualifying. The court held that the article qualified for copyright protection, and ruled that Tencent as employer of the group operating the Dreamwriter system was the article’s author\n\nThe ruling relies upon and interprets China’s Regulations for the Implementation of the Copyright Law\n\n**B.  Chinese rulings granting copyright to AI-generated pictorial images (4 cases)**\n\nCase Name: *Li v. Liu*\n\nCase Number: (2023) Jing 0491 Min Chu No. 11279\n\nCourt: Beijing Internet Court\n\nFiled: May 25, 2023\n\nRuling Date: November 27, 2023\n\nMain claim type and allegation: Copyright; plaintiff alleged defendant copied and used plaintiff’s pictorial image without plaintiff’s permission or compensation\n\nThe image at issue was generated by the plaintiff using Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion AI image generator software\n\nThe court found the plaintiff had provided significant input and intellectual contributions to the pictorial work, including personal expression and aesthetic choices. The court held that the image qualified for copyright protection, and ruled that plaintiff was the author of the image\n\nThe court is a specialized intellectual property court in China, and its rulings are not necessarily binding on other Chinese courts\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nCase Name: *Shanghai Xinchuanghua Cultural Development Co., Ltd. v. “AI Company”*; (“AI Company” is a pseudonym)\n\nCase Number: (2024) Guangdong 0192 Civil No. 113\n\nCourt: Guangzhou Internet Court\n\nFiled:\n\nRuling Date: February 2, 2024\n\nMain claim type and allegation: Copyright; plaintiff alleged defendant copied and used the graphical image of the famous “Ultraman” character licensed to plaintiff, without plaintiff’s permission or compensation, for use in training defendant’s AI platform that allows users to create new, derivative images of popular characters\n\nUnknown why the defendant and its website are pseudonymized in the case report\n\nThe court found copyright infringement and granted relief to the plaintiff\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nCase Name: *Lin v.* [*Hangzhou Gauss Membrane Technology*](http://www.360doc.com/content/24/1120/20/8745981_1139866555.shtml) *Co., Ltd., et al.*\n\nCase Number: (2024)\n\nCourt: Changshu People’s Court\n\nFiled:\n\nRuling Date: October 18, 2024\n\nMain claim type and allegation: Copyright; plaintiff alleged defendant copied and used plaintiff’s pictorial image without plaintiff’s permission or compensation\n\nThe image at issue was generated by the plaintiff using Midjourney’s AI image generator software\n\nThe court found human creativity went into the making of a work, and held that the image qualified for copyright protection\n\nThe court found copyright infringement and granted relief to the plaintiff\n\nThis case is acknowledged as China’s second AI image copyright case, after *Li v. Liu* listed above\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nCase Name: *Wang v Wuhan Technology Co., Ltd.*\n\nCase Number: (2025)\n\nCourt: Wuhan East Lake High-tech Zone Court\n\nFiled:\n\nRuling Date: February 6, 2025\n\nMain claim type and allegation: Copyright; plaintiff alleged defendant copied and used plaintiff’s pictorial image without plaintiff’s permission or compensation\n\nThe image at issue was generated by the plaintiff using Deepseek’s AI image generator software\n\nThe court found that Plaintiff could foresee and control the resulting image to a certain extent; plaintiff’s prompts embodied his unique human expression that directly correlated with the final generated image. The court held that the image qualified for copyright protection, and ruled that plaintiff was the author of the image\n\nThe court found copyright infringement and granted relief to the plaintiff\n\n**C.  Czech ruling denying copyright to AI-generated pictorial image (1 case)**\n\nCase Name: *S. Š. v TAUBEL LEGAL, advokátní kancelář s.r.o.*\n\nCase Number:\n\nCourt: Prague Municipal Court\n\nFiled: June 20, 2023\n\nRuling Date: October 11, 2023\n\nMain claim type and allegation: Copyright; plaintiff alleged defendant wrongly copied and used on its website a pictorial image created by plaintiff using an AI generative system\n\nThe court held that under Czech law an image generated by an AI system does not qualify for copyright protection\n\nThe case was dismissed on unrelated procedural grounds\n\n**D.  Chinese ruling protecting human voice against misappropriation (1 case)**\n\nCase Name: *Yin vs. Beijing Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd., et al.*\n\nCase Number:\n\nCourt: Beijing Internet Court\n\nFiled: 2024\n\nRuling Date: 2024\n\nMain claim type and allegation: Misappropriation; plaintiff alleged defendants copied and used plaintiff’s vocal tonalities for use with an AI text-to-speech generator without plaintiff’s permission or compensation\n\nPlaintiff’s voice had been captured when plaintiff, who is a voice actor, performed voice work under contract for one of the defendants. The copyright that defendant held in plaintiff’s voice work did not permit defendants to appropriate plaintiff’s vocal tonalities and characteristics\n\nThe court found the AI-generated voice was sufficiently similar to the plaintiff’s voice to cause people to identify the AI-generated voice as plaintiff’s voice. The court found plaintiff’s voice to have been wrongly appropriated, and granted various forms of relief to the plaintiff\n\nThe Beijing Internet Court is a specialized intellectual property court in China, and its rulings are not necessarily binding on other Chinese courts; however, the Supreme People’s Court designated this case as a “typical case,” giving it more precedential weight\n\n**E.  German image scraping ruling (1 case)**\n\nCase Name: *Kneschke v.

N.Y. State Dept. of Corrections and Community Supervision, et al.*\n\nRuling Citation: 81 Misc. 3d 281, 197 N.Y.S.3d 463 (Sup. Ct. 2023)\n\nOriginally filed: November 15, 2022\n\nRuling Date: September 14, 2023\n\nCourt Type: State\n\nCourt: Supreme Court of N.Y., Albany County (in New York, the “Supreme Court” is actually the lower, trial court)\n\nPlaintiff made a request of the New York State Deportment of Corrections under a New York state FOIA-type law known as “FOIL” for the internal algorithms and “norming data” used by the COMPAS Re-entry risk assessment tool, an AI product producing a ranked assessment of an offender’s risk of recidivism if granted parole. That information request was denied and plaintiff brought suit in New York state court to force disclosure of the requested information\n\nOther main defendant (respondent): equivant Corrections, formerly Northpointe, Inc.\n\nOn September 14, 2023, the court refused disclosure of the requested information and dismissed the case, ruling the requested information was exempt from disclosure because it was a trade secret of the AI provider\n\nThe court’s ruling is “published” and carries weight as legal precedent, although of a lower court\n\n**B.  British photographic images case (main copyright claim dropped) (1 case)**\n\nCase Name: *Getty Images (US), Inc., et al. v. Stability AI*\n\nClaim Number: IL-2023-000007\n\nCourt: UK High Court\n\nFiled: November 13, 2024\n\nOriginal main claim type and allegation: Copyright; claimant (plaintiff) alleges defendant’s “Stable Diffusion” AI system called “DreamStudio” scraped and used plaintiff’s copyrighted photographic images without permission or compensation\n\nAmong defendant’s copyright defenses were the U.K. “fair dealing” doctrine, similar to the U.S. “fair use” defense, and the defense that training an LLM is a “transformative use” of plaintiff’s data\n\nTrial was held in June 2025, and at trial plaintiff withdrew its copyright claim, leaving remaining its trademark, “passing off,” and secondary copyright infringement claims. This move does not necessarily reflect on the merits of copyright and fair use, because under UK law a different, separate aspect needed to be proved, that the copying took place within the UK, and it was becoming clear that the plaintiff was not going to be able to show this aspect\n\nBecause the direct copyright claim was dropped, this case is no longer particularly relevant to AI\n\n# 19.  Notes:\n\nThis is a round-up of AI court cases and rulings currently pending, in the news, or deemed significant (by me)\n\nThe cases are listed here roughly in chronological order of their original initiation\n\nIf this post gets so old that Reddit \"locks it down,\" I will post an updated duplicate of it\n\n**Please feel free to let me know about any other pending and/or important AI cases for inclusion here!**\n\n**Stay tuned!**\n\nStay tuned to ASLNN - The Apprehensive\\_Sky Legal News Network^(SM) for more developments!\n\n# Acknowledgements:\n\nKudos to CourtListener\\[dot\\]com for the federal court dockets and documents\n\nKudos to Mishcon de Reya LLP and its page at *www*\\[dot\\]*mishcon*\\[dot\\]*com/generative-ai-intellectual-property-cases-and-policy-tracker* for certain international and obscure cases\n\nKudos to CMS Legal Services EEIG and its page at *cms*\\[dot\\]*law/en/int/publication/artificial-intelligence-and-copyright-case-tracker* for certain international cases\n\nKudos to Tech Policy Press and its page at *www*\\[dot\\]*techpolicy*\\[dot\\]*press/ai-lawsuits-worth-watching-a-curated-guide* for certain “social policy” cases\n\nLive page links are not included just above because live links can freak out some subs\n\n# P.S.: Wombat!\n\nThis gives you a catchy, uncommon mnemonic keyword for referring back to this post.

Vidal*\n\nRuling Citation: 43 F.4th 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2022)\n\nOriginally filed: August 6, 2020\n\nRuling Date: August 5, 2022\n\nCourt Type: Federal\n\nCourt: U.S. Court of Appeals, Federal Circuit\n\nSame plaintiff as case listed below, Stephen Thaler\n\nPlaintiff applied for a patent citing only a piece of AI software as the inventor. The Patent Office refused to consider granting a patent to an AI device. The district court agreed, and then the appeals court agreed, that only humans can be granted a patent. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the ruling\n\nThe appeals court’s ruling is “published” and carries the full weight of legal precedent\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n**Internationally**, plaintiff Thaler’s claims were similarly defeated in these rulings:\n\n**Australia:** *Commissioner of Patents v. Thaler*, No. \\[2022\\] FCAFC 62\n\n**Canada:** *Thaler, Stephen L. (Ré)*, 2025 CACP 8\n\n**European Community:** No. J0008/20-3.1.01, RJ/N35111-EP (2021), preliminary ruling affirmed by the Legal Board of Appeal on December 21, 2021\n\n**Germany:** The Federal Patent Court in 2021 and the Federal Court of Justice in 2024 refused to grant a patent to an artificial device, but offered to grant the patent if Thaler were listed as the inventor and a statement were added to the patent application that Thaler “prompted the artificial intelligence DABUS to generate the invention.” This was upheld by the Federal Court of Justice.\n\n**Japan:** Tokyo District Court, Case No. 2023 RS 5001 (2024), affirmed by Japanese Intellectual Property High Court, Case No. 2024 RS 10006 (2025)\n\n**New Zealand:** *Thaler v. Commissioner of Patents*, No. CIV-2022-485-118, \\[2023\\] NZHC 554\n\n**South Korea:** The Seoul Administrative Court in 2023 refused registration.\n\n**Switzerland:** B-2532/2024 (Federal Administrative Court 2025)\n\n**Taiwan:** *Thaler v.

Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks* \\[2023\\] UKSC 49\n\n**Note:** Plaintiff Thaler also filed similar patent applications in Brazil (refused by patent office in 2023), China (no ruling, but Chinese law forbids patent grant to AI device), India (refused by patent office), Israel (refused by patent office in 2023), and Singapore (application abandoned)\n\n**Note:** Thaler’s AI patent was **granted** in South Africa, where patent applications are not substantively examined, and also in Saudi Arabia\n\n**Note:** Kudos to [IPstars.com](http://IPstars.com) for most of the international cases\n\n**B.     “AI device cannot be granted a copyright” court ruling (1 case)**\n\nCase Name: *Thaler v. Perlmutter*\n\nRuling Citation: 130 F.4th 1039 (D.C. Cir. 2025), *reh’g en banc denied,* May 12, 2025\n\nOriginally filed: June 2, 2022\n\nRuling Date: March 18, 2025\n\nCourt Type: Federal\n\nCourt: U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit\n\nSame plaintiff as case listed above, Stephen Thaler\n\nPlaintiff applied for a copyright registration, claiming an AI device as sole author of the work. The Copyright Office refused to grant a registration to an AI device. The district court agreed, and then the appeals court agreed, that only humans, and not machines, can be authors and so granted a copyright\n\nThe appeals court’s ruling is “published” and carries the full weight of legal precedent\n\n**Ruling summary and highlights:**\n\nA human author enjoys an unregistered copyright as soon as a work is created, then enjoys more rights once a copyright registration is secured. The court ruled that because a machine cannot be an author, an AI device enjoys no copyright at all, ever.\n\nThe court noted the requirement that the author be human comes from the federal copyright statute, and so the court did not reach any issues regarding the U.S. Constitution.\n\nA copyright is a piece of intellectual property, and machines cannot own property. Machines are tools used by authors, machines are never authors themselves.\n\nA requirement of human authorship actually stretches back decades. The National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works said in its report back in 1978:\n\n>The computer, like a camera or a typewriter, is an inert instrument, capable of functioning only when activated either directly or indirectly by a human. When so activated it is capable of doing only what it is directed to do in the way it is directed to perform.\n\nThe Copyright Law includes a doctrine of “work made for hire” wherein a human author can at any time assign his or her copyright in a work to another entity of any kind, even at the moment the work is created. However, an AI device *never* has copyright, even at moment at work creation, so there is no right to be transferred. Therefore, an AI device cannot transfer a copyright to another entity under the “work for hire” doctrine.\n\nAny change to the system that requires human authorship must come from Congress in new laws and from the Copyright Office, not from the courts. Congress and the Copyright Office are also the ones to grapple with future issues raised by progress in AI, including AGI. (Believe it or not, *Star Trek: TNG*’s Data gets a nod.)\n\nThe ruling applies only to works authored solely by an AI device. The plaintiff said in his application that the AI device was the sole author, and the plaintiff never argued otherwise to the Copyright Office, so they took him at his word. The plaintiff then raised too late in court the additional argument that he is the author of the work because he built and operated the AI device that created the work; accordingly, that argument was not considered.\n\nHowever, the appeals court seems quite accepting of granting copyright to humans who create works with AI assistance. The court noted (without ruling on them) the Copyright Office’s rules for granting copyright to AI-assisted works, and it said: “The \\[statutory\\] rule requires only that the author of that work be a human being—*the person who created, operated, or used artificial intelligence*—and not the machine itself” (emphasis added).\n\nCourt opinions often contain snippets that get repeated in other cases essentially as soundbites that have or gain the full force of law. One such potential soundbite in this ruling is: “Machines lack minds and do not intend anything.”\n\n# 2.  Federal AI facial recognition wrongful arrest cases (6 cases)\n\n**In each case,** the main claim type is or was civil rights violation and the main allegation  is or was that defendant’s AI facial recognition system unreliably as regards race misidentified plaintiff, who is Black, as the perpetrator of a crime which led to plaintiff’s wrongful arrest and incarceration\n\nSome cases have settled and some are still ongoing\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nCase Name: *Oliver v.

Hixon\n\nOther major plaintiffs: Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Junot Díaz, Andrew Sean Greer, David Henry Hwang, Matthew Klam, Laura Lippman, Rachel Louise Snyder, Jacqueline Woodson, Lysa TerKeurst, and Christopher Farnsworth\n\nOther major defendants: Bloomberg L.P., Microsoft Corp.; Elutherai Institute voluntarily dismissed without prejudice\n\nPartial motion to dismiss granted, trimming down claims on November 20, 2023; no published citation\n\nMotion to dismiss partially granted, partially denied, trimming down claims on March 7, 2025; no published citation\n\nDefendant’s motion for summary judgment on fair use granted by a ruling dated **June 25, 2025**, two days after the *Bartz* ruling below, dismissing plaintiffs’ copyright claims. Citation: (N.D. Cal. 2025)\n\nHowever, the ruling’s rationale is that LLM training *should* constitute copyright infringement and *should not* be fair use. The plaintiffs’ copyright case is nonetheless dismissed because the plaintiffs pursued the wrong claims, theories, and evidence\n\nThe ruling reasons that of primary importance to fair use analysis is the harm to the market for the copyrighted work. It finds persuasive the “market dilution” or “indirect substitution” theory of market harm. This is a new construct, and the ruling warns against “robotically applying concepts from previous cases without stepping back to consider context,” because “fair use is meant to be a flexible doctrine that takes account of significant changes in technology.” The ruling concludes “it seems likely that market dilution will often cause plaintiffs to decisively win the \\[market harm\\] factor—and thus win the fair use question overall—in cases like this.” However, because plaintiffs in this case did not advance or operate on that factor and theory, their case fails\n\nThe ruling suggests that the optimal outcome is not AI companies ceasing to scrape content creators’ works, but instead for AI companies to pay the content creators for the scraping, and it briefly mentions the practicality of group licensing\n\nThis ruling fairly strongly disagrees with the *Bartz* ruling in several ways. In rationale these two rulings are fully opposed. Most importantly, this ruling believes the *Bartz* ruling gave too little weight to the all-important market-harm factor of fair use. It further disagrees with the *Bartz* ruling’s notion that LLM learning and human learning are legally similar for fair use purposes. Still, like *Bartz*, the ruling does find the LLM use to be “highly transformative,” but that by itself is not enough to establish fair use\n\n**The rationale of this ruling is a win for content creators and a loss for AI companies, but this ruling is also a loss for these particular plaintiffs**\n\nSee my two separate posts about this unusual ruling:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1lpqhrj](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1lpqhrj)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1lkm12y](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1lkm12y)\n\nPlaintiffs in their filings since the ruling have not suggested they would request a new change to proceed under Judge Chhabria's theory of fair use, and they have said they will not ask for an immediate appeal, instead leaving any appeal for after the case is fully decided\n\n**C.  Generative AI; class action, fair use found (1 case)**\n\nCase Name: *Bartz, et al. v. Anthropic PBG*, Case No. 3:24-cv-05417-WHA **(now proceeding as a class action)**\n\nFiled: August 19, 2024\n\nRuling: June 23, 2025\n\nCourt: U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco)\n\nPresiding Judge: William H. Alsup; Magistrate Judge: None\n\nThe data at issue are books, and plaintiffs are book authors\n\nOn July 17, 2025, the court certified one class of plaintiffs, but denied certification for other classes; Citation:\n\nRuling in favor of Defendant on doctrine of fair use handed down on **June 23, 2025**, two days before the *Kadrey* ruling above, finding scraping and output by Claude was a transformative use and fair use, analogizing LLM learning to human learning; important that no passages from plaintiffs' work found their way into the Claude output\n\nThe ruling leans heavily on the “transformative use” component of fair use, finding the training use to be “spectacularly” transformative, leading to a use “as orthogonal as can be imagined to the ordinary use of a book.” The ruling heavily relies upon the analogy between fair use when humans learn from books and when LLMs learn from books.\n\nThe ruling distinguishes the *Thomson Reuters* ruling listed above for the reason that in *Thomson Reuters* the AI was non-generative, and performed a similar function to the plaintiff's system, while an LLM as generative AI produces an output completely unlike the plaintiffs' works.\n\nThe ruling also finds significant that no passages of the plaintiffs’ books found their way into the LLM’s output to its users. The ruling further holds that the LLM output will not displace demand for copies of the authors’ books in an actionable way, even though an LLM might produce works that will compete with the authors’ works. This is because when either a device or a human learns from reading the authors’ books and then produces competing books, this is not an infringing outcome.\n\nThe case will not continue as to AI, but will continue as to certain other, pirate-copied works\n\n**This ruling is a win for AI companies and a loss for content creators**\n\n# Continue to Part Two:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1mcp05c](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1mcp05c)\n\n# Acknowledgements:\n\nKudos to CourtListener\\[dot\\]com for the federal court dockets and documents\n\nKudos to Mishcon de Reya LLP and its page at *www*\\[dot\\]*mishcon*\\[dot\\]*com/generative-ai-intellectual-property-cases-and-policy-tracker* for certain international and obscure cases\n\nKudos to CMS Legal Services EEIG and its page at *cms*\\[dot\\]*law/en/int/publication/artificial-intelligence-and-copyright-case-tracker* for certain international cases\n\nKudos to Tech Policy Press and its page at *www*\\[dot\\]*techpolicy*\\[dot\\]*press/ai-lawsuits-worth-watching-a-curated-guide* for certain “social policy” cases\n\nLive page links are not included just above because live links can freak out some subs\n\n# P.S.: Wombat!\n\nThis gives you a catchy, uncommon mnemonic keyword for referring back to this post.

And if you feel it should? Should AI write all code? Because make no mistake that's the end game. The endgame isn't to help you generate annoying config files, or generate unit test. It is to have fully automonous software systems built and maintain FULLY by AI.\n\n  \nSo if you're a proponent of AI as the future of coding. Then the question is \"in a perfect world, should AI generate code\". Meaning basically \"is it a liability to code WITHOUT AI\". Because the value of code isn't how fast you write it. Its more about what it does how well it deals with failure scenarios. Every proposed AI solution is to create a world where you don't need human programmers.\n\n  \nSo taken to its absolute extreme, would you trust an Air traffic control system written 100% by AI? How about medical device equipment? How about software that manages infrastructure? Would you trust a database whose code is 100% AI generated? IF not, then why not? ",

It’s using supabase as backend so you could run a social network on their free tier. \n \nEverything other than the auth provider is built like a plug-in. Posts, comments, notifications plugins are done. You can extend it or create your own. It’s still very early stage but I am liking the direction it’s going. I have added a readme to get you started if you want to fork it and create your own. \n\nIt’s easily themeable. With component styles in 1 file and theme in light and dark files. \n\nNext I will be try to build out the plugins for the basic features. Profile, media plugins. After that an auto moderation plugin. \n\nThere is also an app config where you can control a everything. Like if you want the app to be image only or video only (not yet implemented) but you get the point. Everything is built around the app config. \n\nAttached the home screen. Doesnt look anything special but it’s just a post plugin which is activated by the app config. \n\nGithub link - https://github.com/Alekoii/onevearth\n\nGive a star if you think this is an interesting approach. \n\nWhy am I building this - I tried to create a support app 2 years ago and back then I didn’t know much about technical details. Still don’t know much but I have learnt a lot in 2 years. I had hired devs to build this and it cost a lot of money for something 2 of my friends use. Tbh I like using it too. We post there everyday. I wanted to build this so that others don’t have to start from scratch when building a social platform. Just extend the features using the plugin system. \n\nI will use this to rebuild the support social app which my friends use because that app is aging and has not been updated in a year. \n\n",

        "title": "CodeVROOM - a symbol-level AI editor for large projects",
        "content": "Hi All,\n\nJust wanted to share something cool I've been working on for the past half a year.\n\n[CodeVROOM](https://codevroom.com/) is a symbol-level AI editor designed for very fast incremental edits to large projects.\n\nInstead of including entire files with your editing request, it trims them to include just the relevant parts, while preserving the overall structure, so the models won't get confused. It can also automatically ask the model what other symbols are relevant to a particular edit, and restart the conversation with these symbols. Here's an [example](https://sysprogs.com/CodeVROOM/documentation/examples/connecting/filter/) how a couple of context discovery steps quickly get from a hallucination-ridden answer to a straight-to-the-point implementation. And because the model works with heavily trimmed source files, it works very fast (1-2 seconds per step with Cerebras platform) and has negligible token costs (typically, under a cent per edit).\n\nThe main difference from CLI tools is to give the user full control over what's going on. You can step the editing session back, see what symbols the model deemed relevant, edit them, and retry. Or you can retry individual steps, switch between models at any point, or do special steps like \"discover more context\" or \"expand my original instructions, giving several options\". Most steps only take a few seconds with smaller models (LLaMA on Cerebras) or about a minute on larger models (Claude), so it's very easy to review what the model is doing, and steer it into the correct direction. You can also do things like ask Claude to expand your instructions, and then let LLaMA implement them.\n\nCodeVROOM is built from scratch using .Net (WPF on Windows, Avalonia on Linux/Mac), so it has some unique features that other editors don't have. E.g. the [change reviewing logic](https://sysprogs.com/CodeVROOM/documentation/features/diffs/) is integrated with the outline, so you always have an overview of the added/removed/edited members, and can approve/reject edits in bulk. Or you can collapse series of unchanged members to see all edits at a glance (but with full context unlike plain diffs), or switch between inline and side-by-side modes.\n\nThe main use case is routine edits and refactorings that are not handled by the existing refactoring tools, and take several minutes to do by hand. Even small AI models handle these very well, and getting reviewable results from a consise prompt in a second or two is just way less distracting than doing it by hand. There are some examples of real-world edits [here](https://sysprogs.com/CodeVROOM/?features=examples).\n\nThere's also support for AI techniques where you provide plain-text instructions how to do a particular recurring task, and can then reference it from a prompt (port size-related properties per @@PropertyPorting) and edit templates where you can write instructions for common edits (e.g. add null checks to a function) and then invoke them by clicking on a link above the function.\n\nCodeVROOM supports 10 common cloud providers and local models via Ollama. It has old-school perpetual licenses with 1 year of free updates, there is no telemetry, and no lock-in.\n\nIt is still early in development with tons of more features coming, but it can already save you some time side-by-side with your main IDE. The trial will remain unlimited until more IDE features are ready.",

Man, it’s been making some really dumb mistakes. Like, basic syntax errors, forgetting context mid-conversation, suggesting deprecated APIs. I’m pretty sure they’re running a quantized version now because the quality drop has been noticeable.\n\nI’m mostly writing Cloudflare worker backends. \n\nI decided to give this new GLM-4.5 model a shot. Holy shit. This thing gets it right on the first try. Every. Single. Time. I’m talking about:\n\n\t•\tComplex async/await patterns with Durable Objects\n\t•\tKV store integrations with proper error handling\n\t•\tWebSocket connections that actually work\n\t•\tEven the tricky stuff like handling FormData in edge environments\n\nIt’s like $0.60 for input token/Million, and my usage is mostly input tokens. So, I’m going to try the pay per token approach and see how much mileage I get before I spend too much. \n\nAgain, it feels delightful again to code with AI, when it just gets it right the first time.

        "content": "For the past 18 months, my colleague and I have been working on a decentralized AI factory, **Ebiose**, an open-source initiative (MIT license) born at Inria (the French lab behind projects like scikit-learn).\n\nEbiose aims to create a decentralized AI factory, a Darwin-style playground (à la Google’s AlphaEvolve) where AI agents design, test, and evolve other agents. Anyone can launch their own \"forge,\" define a task, and watch AI agents compete until the fittest emerge.\n\nThis evolutionary approach demands massive inference resources. Currently, we're relying on cloud APIs, but our long-term vision is a fully decentralized, community-driven system.\n\nThat's why we'd love input from the LocalLLaMA community!\n\n**The Big Idea: A Community-Powered P2P Inference Grid**\n\nWe’re dreaming of a peer-to-peer compute grid that taps into the idle power of community-run machines, like Folding@home, but for local LLMs. Here’s the plan:\n\n* **Lightweight Client:** A background app runs on your PC (and maybe phones later).\n* **Hardware Profiling:** The client auto-detects what LLMs your machine can handle.\n* **Orchestration Layer:** A system (centralized or decentralized?) assigns inference tasks to capable nodes.\n* **Dynamic LoRA Adapters:** Fine-tune models efficiently with lightweight, modular adapters.\n* **Batch & Prompt Caching:** Optimize for high throughput by batching requests and reusing system prompts.\n\n**Technical Questions for the Community**\n\n1. **Inference Backend:** We’re leaning toward **llama.cpp** for its lightweight design and broad hardware support (CPU, Metal, CUDA). But for a distributed, high-throughput setup, would **vLLM**, **zml**, or another engine be better? Since we’re prioritizing batch processing over single-prompt speed, what’s your pick?\n2. **Task Orchestration:** How do we route inference jobs (e.g., “run this 13B model with this prompt”) to nodes with the right model cached and enough VRAM/RAM? Has anyone tackled this kind of distributed task management?\n3. **Existing Tools:** Are there open-source projects we could build on?\n\nWhat do you think? Got ideas, tools, or experiences to share?",

I am stoned right now and stuck to a chair for 4 hours, but I also have so many thoughts with all this free time.  Here are a few I would love love some pushback on, or love my idea and just add to it!  \n  \nA.I. Is about to destroy our current age of information and lead us inadvertently to the age of disinformation.  People have motives, governments have agendas.  We already see governments flooding social media with misinformation to push a naritive.  As for another example, the other day I tried to google an imagine of a bacteria and it was just millions of results of fakes \"generated\" images.  How will people 20 years from now know when they are looking at a perfectly faked A.I. image as a posed to something genuine?  \n  \nA.I. is rapidly replacing jobs and funneling the benefits to just the select few big wigs at the top, while the only way A.I could be where it is today is off of combined human contributions.  This is unfair beyond any logic I can think off.  We need a Universal Basic Income (UBI) to counter this unjust gap in pay that was not possible without public knowledge.  UBI will be inevitable one day when all jobs are ran by robots.\n  \nThe big wigs aren't the only winners, maybe the silver lining is this; As companies see record growth as they lay people off, their stock portfolio will see record gains as well.  Maybe the future of income will be innovators creating services A.I. can help with and a person's income is investing in that stock that believe has potential to be a product some people would spend some of their UBI on.  \n  \nAgain this is an open discussion, I want some genuine fun feedback.  Idk how to make it obvious I am not A.I. and this makes me believe in my beliefe of misinformation so much more, which is step one.\n  \n",

        "content": "Over the past few weeks, I’ve been running a real-time experiment in synthetic culture: an automated livestream featuring AI-generated music, scripted robot TV, robot DJ interludes, and ‘unscripted’ content — all designed not for human viewers, but for an imagined audience of robots.\n\nIt’s called Botflix, and it runs like a cultural transmission from another dimension — no login, no agenda, just weird synthetic entertainment. The idea wasn’t to “fake” humanity, but to build in-universe content as if robots had their own aesthetic sensibilities, quirks, and cultural tastes.\n\nHere’s what’s surprised me:\n\t•\tWe’ve hit 194 simultaneous radio listeners and over 20,000 unique listeners in the last 24 hours.\n\t•\tCountries like Iran, India, France, Canada and many others are tuning in- we even logged listeners on Ascension Island. \n\t•\tThe most requested track so far? A robot country-western banger called “Binary Rodeo” from a robot country singer named Chrome Cowboy.\n\t•\tPeople are interacting with it as if it’s real. And some (understandably) are very confused.\n\nBut what I’m most interested in isn’t the numbers — it’s the emergent emotional effect of this kind of AI-native media. Viewers start anthropomorphizing the DJs. They talk about the robots as if they’re alive. The uncanny starts to feel… charming?\n\nAnd now I’m wondering:\n\t•\tWhat happens when AI isn’t used to mimic us, but to generate culture of its own?\n\t•\tCan these artificial “in-world” audiences give us a new creative language for collaboration, not competition?\n\t•\tWhat does it mean when synthetic media starts getting real human fans? And brings in real human artists with human made and hybrid art? \n\nI’m not promoting anything — if this thing sinks or swims is not up to me, but I am genuinely curious what others here think. Especially anyone exploring AI as a cultural entity, not just a productivity tool.\n\nHappy to go deeper if anyone’s interested.\n",

Yes: If fictional violence is acceptable in horror movies, TV, video games, and art, then it does seem illogical or inconsistent for AI platforms to block similar imagery just because it's generated by a machine.\\* Let’s cut through the corporate language and acknowledge this clearly: You Are Right — It Is Inconsistent A teenager can stream Saw, The Purge, or Game of Thrones — full of graphic choking, torture, and murder — on Netflix or YouTube. They can buy posters with bloody knives, strangled victims, or horror scenes at any store. But if they type \"person being choked in a dark hallway, dramatic lighting, horror movie still\" into an AI image generator? Blocked. \"Violent content.\" That is a contradiction. And no amount of \"safety\" talk erases the fact that: The same content is allowed in one medium but banned in another — not because of harm, but because of how it was made. Make it make sense!'",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, I recently covered the GLM-4.5 model and it is a pretty good model. There's also a smaller model, which is the Air variant, and that is something you can run locally on a high-tier MacBook, which is quite awesome and pretty capable as well. It is available for a pretty cheap API pricing. It costs very little and it's great at tool calling and everything like that as well. Plus, you can also use it completely free without any limits on their chat platform as well. It's quite good for sure. However, there's also something that they launched alongside that and that is a new option called Full-Stack. I found this option pretty amazing and thought I should talk about it. So, what you'll have to do is come to their Z.ai chat platform and then just get signed up. Once that is done, you'll see this chat interface. You can select the model here and use it as much as you want. But, as you can see here, you also have the Full-Stack option. This is a pretty cool one. So, what this does is pretty amazing. It basically spins up a sandbox, and then the coder here codes in that sandbox and creates whole projects with databases, multiple files, and it can code in any language as well. Because it can actually run any kind of terminal command and everything as well. If you think about it, then it is like Manus or ChatGPT agent, but without the option to do web searches or similar stuff. It's just focused on coding. So, that is basically an overview of it. But, let's try to use it as well. But before we do that, a quick word from today's sponsor, Augment Code. This isn't your average AI assistant. Augment Code is an enterprise-grade AI built for real engineering teams working in massive, fast-moving codebases, not toy apps or vibe coding. It's far superior than WindSurf and Cursor because of its proprietary context engine that delivers millisecond relevant snippets even across 100K file monorepos, feeding your entire repo, even millions of lines, into the best model available in real time. You get smart in-context suggestions that make sense for your production code. With Claude Sonnet 4 + Augment Context delivering the best quality at the same price. No model picker needed. Augment upgrades for you automatically. There's no need to switch editors. Augment works seamlessly in VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, and even Cursor. No forks, no compromises. It's secure by default and never trains on your code and supports customer-managed encryption keys. You're only billed for successful requests, that's paper message pricing, no seat licenses or complicated token math. Augment recently launched powerful new features like remote agents, which let you launch, monitor, and merge pull requests from parallel cloud workers without draining your local CPU. If you're ready to code with AI that keeps up with you, sign up for a free 14-day trial at augmentcode.com. Link is in the description. Now, back to the video. So, I'm going to ask it to build me a car driving three dot JS game. And now, once we send it, you'll see that it will first spin up a virtual sandbox for us. It's pretty snappy and it gets started quite easily. Then, it will go ahead and open up a panel on the right as well. Where you'll see the files and the preview once the code is generated. Now, you can also see that it can easily run terminal commands here as well. Here, it is running terminal commands and checking the files and stuff as well. You can see that it will run a bunch of commands in order to check what code is already there and similar things. It will also use the terminal to install packages that are not available or needed in order to make sure that it all works. You can see the diff of the changes that it has done for you here. It is really good at coding and stuff with this agentic loop. It's really well done here. In a bit, it gets done and you can see the preview on the right. And it looks pretty awesome and works well. It is amazingly detail-focused. It's like Manus but extremely focused on coding instead. And it is pretty awesome. If they add web search capabilities to it, and maybe browser capabilities, then it can become an awesome alternative to stuff like that, which is great. One thing is that it can be a bit unstable at times because their infrastructure is overloaded at this time, and it can give you some errors at times or something. But just refresh and it should work fine again. So, that should work well. Now, you can also download the whole project and workspace as well with the download option. It will give you a zip file that you can download and then use the source code locally. It's pretty awesome if you ask me, as you can continue on the project locally quite easily. You can also share the preview with others as well by clicking this option, which will open up the preview here. And then you can share it with others as well and let others use it too. Also, if there are multiple roots, then you can also go to them through the option here at the top as well. Another option is publish. Publish will basically publish it to a URL and that would mostly run 24/7, which is also great. If you create a small app and want to let it run, then that can be done. So, this is quite good. It is a really awesome coder that actually gets a sandbox and then works on its own. It is capable for most stuff. But if it had internet surfing and browser capabilities, then it would have been even better for sure. I think that they can add it soon enough. Now, there are some limitations, and one of the major ones is that it only allows you to have two workspaces per account at once. So, if you want to work on a third project, then you have to delete one of them before proceeding. Apart from this, there is not much limit, which is pretty good. This is an amazing model for sure. Also, if you get more errors because of the high traffic, then you can switch to the Air model and that has no errors at all. That is also pretty good and works with the full stack stuff as well. It is also faster and you'll get the responses super fast with that. That is majorly how it works. I found this pretty amazing and you can go ahead and use this as well and see what sticks for you and what doesn't. I find this really amazing because there are some coders like Codex and Jewels, which perform similarly, but this is a new take on that thing and it works pretty well. You can go ahead and use it as well and let me know how well it performs for you. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
