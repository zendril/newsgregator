Sitting around the lunch table, the question was asked, and soon enough someone was asking an AI the same question, the answer? according to the UN, 195 or 193 if you don’t include the Vatican and Palestine, and so that was the accepted answer. Something about that answer seemed incomplete to me, so I dug deeper, asking the same question in a google search, ignoring the AI generated response, I found a blog post, a man trying to visit “every country” on earth, who broke down the ways we a “country”, and how it differs between nations, as to who or what they accept as a “country”. The answer he came up with, was 215 if you wanted to know, but the answer is actually irrelevant, what’s relevant, is that an entire table of people were willing to accept as fact, that there were only 195 countries, when in reality, the answer may not be that simple, and the AI didn’t explore deeper. \n\nWe are becoming people who are no longer WILLING to think and explore deeper, surface level answers are good enough. Now you might rightfully say, “who cares? knowing how many countries there are isn’t important enough to think deeply on”, and you might be right, that’s pretty irrelevant to our day to day lives, but the trend of taking things at face value, and not CRITICALLY THINKING, is very important and if you don’t think this will bleed over into things that ARE important questions, ideas, beliefs, in our lives, you’re a fool. \n\nThis is less of a criticism of AI, as it is on society, I’m sure you could prompt the “AI” further, and get there eventually, but how many people are questioning their “AIs” responses? And by the way, finding a blog post of a guy who has done the work for you, still isn’t thinking deeply, if you wanted to do get that deep, you would have to do what that guy did, research. But I would say, even thinking deep enough to say “is there more to this answer that what the statistical generator has spat out to me?” Is better than taking the answer at face value.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI own a small shop. We used to rely on old-fashioned marketing strategies to generate profits. We barely got any website visits. However, since our customer base started asking about our website, I had to jump on the AI bandwagon.\n\n# What I did?\n\nWe already had a website, but it lacked an e-commerce section. I made some improvements, including a professional design and an online shopping section. A professional made it; I didn't intervene.\n\n# Where I used AI?\n\nMy whole world changed when I discovered the meaning of \"prompt.\" It was a lifesaver! I took simple pictures of my products and saw some prompts on Twitter. Then, MAGIC! Suddenly, my pictures looked professional.\n\nI gave simple descriptions of my products, and again, magic! They became very well-written product descriptions.\n\nAs someone who doesn't know much about computers, this was definitely magical for me. I bought premium subscriptions for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok. They were all beneficial. I started searching more about AI and how I could benefit from it in marketing. I used tools like Aioscop to get AI recommendations and different marketing tools to increase sales. Everything worked perfectly. Obviously, some were just a waste of money, but it was definitely worth trying.\n\n# What I suggest for small businesses?\n\nI was afraid to start an AI business. It seemed too complicated, but it's not. You just need to clearly communicate what you want from AI. I'm getting better every day at using AI and benefiting from it.\n\nI own a handmade shop. People say, \"Oh, you're using AI for a handmade shop?\" Shame...\"\n\nThey're wrong. The world has changed, and AI is a great helper.\n\nI just wanted to vent a little about this.",

        "content": "21/11/25\n\nWritten to those stressed about AI.\n\nGreetings, hope you are well.\n\nI’m a high-school student, piss scared about the development of AI. I read through AI 2027 very thoroughly, and as we speak, I’m shitting bricks.\n\nI’m writing this to, to be honest, contain the research I’ve done on Artificial Intelligence. If possible, could you guys either affirm my beliefs about AI, or snap me back in to reality? If so, thanks.\n\nOptimists of AI claim that AGI will come from 2027-2032, and ASI post-2040.  \n\nTo MY knowledge after research, the number one way AI chips are getting so much better is because they are slowly decreasing transistor size in chips. The smaller the chip, the more they can fit in a confined space. At the moment, the main material used in AI chips is silicon. One silicon atom is 0.2nm. At the moment, the most advanced chips are a few nanometers wide. There is a physical barrier when it comes to making transistors smaller. Making transistors smaller, gets more expensive, and we’re basically at the physical barrier.\n\n3D Stacking.\n\nInstead of laying transistors flat on a chip, you stack multiple layers of silicon wafers on top of each other and connect them with vertical interconnects (through-silicon vias, or TSVs).\n\nPhysical barriers to 3D Stacking? Stacking layers traps heat in the middle, so the more layers you add, the harder it is to cool the inner layers. Now, thermal management is the biggest problem. They use liquid cooling, micro-channels and heat spreaders, but realistically, those only go so far. \n\nNot only that, but there’s genuinely a manufacturing yield. Stack 100 layers, if a layer is defected, there goes the whole chip. That makes 3D Stacking EXPENSIVE AF. \n\nNow, I’ve just listed the physical “walls” to AI progression, and you’re probably smiling, wipe it off though.\n\nNeuromorphic chips. Those fuckers. They may be the silver bullet to AI. They reduce energy consumption, and sort of in the word, they’re inspired by the human brain. IF Neuromorphic chips get scaled to ASI / AGI levels, we as society are fucked. But realistically, we can’t develop ASI / AGI as well if we don’t fix neuromorphic chip engineering problems. Same way, neuromorphic chips need smaller transistors to be better, so 3D stacking is implemented, then heat dissipation, and all that horseshit I was on about earlier. \n\nBut, neuromorphic chips simulate huge networks of neurons and synapses, requiring massive interconnects. Electrical resistance, capacitance, and signal delay in dense wiring become major bottlenecks. Now, neuromorphic chips are also extremely prone to defects as one faulty neuron fucks the whole chip. Also, There’s only so much silicon you can fit on a wafer. 3D stacking for neuromorphic chips faces the same thermal, stress, and signal delay limits as conventional chips.\n\nIn a world full of optimists and pessimists, could we just face reality and think in an unbiased way? In the 50s and 60s, scientists believed everything would be nuclear powered. Offices in the 80s and 90s believed they would once be paper-less. but in reality, bureaucracy, emails, and printers created more paper than ever. Early AI hype in the 80s said machines would be human level within 10 years. But in reality, AI had a cold season for a long time.\n\nWhen I become a billionaire I promise I’ll care about you lot and not train fucking robots to be better than us.\n\nSincerely,\nLeonardo U.",

        "content": "Right now it seems to me that if you use a LLM to research a topic that you have a small amount of knowledge, you need to have a ballpark idea of a reasonable answer to your question.  Note Grok will change and fix the answer if you tell it it is wrong here but the key is you have to already know the right answer.   I will give a recent example.\n\nI asked Grok this question:  \"If a artificial mountain was created out of some now unknown super material that allowed this mountain whose base is rigidly attached to Earth at the equator to reach GEO, could you climb this mountain to the altitude of GEO and step off into orbit?\"\n\n  \nGrok's incorrect response (which might fool a good 90% of the population?):\n\nNo, you could not climb this hypothetical super-material mountain (a \"space pier\" or equatorial tower) from Earth's surface up to geostationary orbit (GEO, \\~35,786 km altitude) and simply step off into a stable orbit. Here's why, even if the structure is magically rigid and strong enough to stand.\n\n1. Orbital velocity at GEO is \\~3.07 km/s, but at the top of the tower you have almost zero tangential velocity\n\n* At the equator, Earth's surface rotates at only 465 m/s (0.465 km/s).\n* As you climb the fixed tower, every point on the tower moves with exactly the same angular velocity as Earth's surface (1 rotation per sidereal day).\n* Therefore, at GEO height, your tangential speed while standing on the tower is still only \\~465 m/s, not the required \\~3.07 km/s for a circular orbit.\n\nYour velocity relative to the center of Earth when you \"step off\" at the top is essentially the same as on the ground: \\~465 m/s eastward. That is far too slow to stay in orbit at that altitude.\n\n2. What actually happens if you jump off the topYou would immediately begin falling back toward Earth on a very long, highly elliptical orbit (actually a narrow ellipse that intersects Earth's surface twice per orbit).\n\n* Perigee: essentially 0 km (Earth's surface at equator)\n* Apogee: \\~35,786 km Because the tower is holding you up until you step off, you have the orbital energy corresponding only to the surface rotation speed, so you fall back down. The trip \"up\" one side of the ellipse (which the tower supplied mechanically) is now gone, and gravity pulls you down the other side.\n\nYou would re-enter the atmosphere at very high speed (\\~10–11 km/s) on the opposite side of the planet unless the tower caught you again on the way down — which it wouldn't.\n\n3. How high would a tower have to be before you could \"step into orbit\"?You need your tangential speed from Earth's rotation to equal the circular orbital speed at that altitude.This occurs at none of the standard orbits. The only altitude where the rotation speed of a point fixed to Earth matches the local circular orbital speed is at geostationary altitude — but as shown above, the rotation speed is still only 465 m/s there, while v\\_circ is 3.07 km/s.In reality, there is no finite altitude where a rigid tower lets you step into a circular orbit, because Earth's rotation rate is fixed at 1 rev/day, and circular orbital period decreases with altitude until \\~84 minutes at LEO. The periods only match again far beyond GEO in the graveyard orbit region, but by then the required centrifugal force vastly exceeds gravity and the structure would fly apart anyway.\n\n4. The only way a climbing tower helps you reach orbitYou still need to supply almost the full Δv yourself (rockets, railgun, etc.) at the top. The tower only saves you the energy to lift your ship/fuel to that altitude and lets you launch in thinner atmosphere/vacuum, which is valuable (that's why space elevators and very tall launch loops are interesting), but you still need \\~2.4–3 km/s of horizontal velocity addition at GEO height for orbit, or \\~7–8 km/s if you build a tower \"merely\" 100–300 km tall mast.Short answerEven with an indestructible magic mountain reaching exactly to GEO, if you climb it and jump off at the top, you fall straight back to Earth (catastrophically). You cannot \"step into orbit\" from a stationary (Earth-fixed) structure) at any altitude.",

        "content": "Steven Levy argues in Wired that the artificial intelligence industry has evolved into a single interconnected entity—dubbed “the Blob”—through a web of partnerships, investments, and cloud agreements among major players like Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, despite originally being founded to prevent profit-driven control of AI.\n\nThe recent Microsoft-Nvidia-Anthropic deal exemplifies this consolidation: Microsoft commits up to $5 billion to Anthropic (a competitor to its primary partner OpenAI), while Anthropic pledges $30 billion for Microsoft Azure computing power and Nvidia invests up to $10 billion in Anthropic in exchange for using Nvidia hardware—creating what one CEO called “one enormous circular machine for money and computing.”\n\nOpenAI, which was established in 2015 as a nonprofit counterbalance to corporate AI development, now holds a valuation between $500 billion and $750 billion, with the U.S. government endorsing the industry’s consolidation—backed in part by foreign powers including Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi—while antitrust regulators remain largely absent.\n\nSource: https://www.wired.com/story/ai-industry-monopoly-nvidia-microsoft-google/",

Inferring neural connectivity considers the cross-correlation of spike timing. Neuromorphic systems utilize online learning algorithms that leverage the temporal correlations of spikes by utilizing spiking neural networks. This research demonstrates real-time, large-scale neural connectivity inference by implementing the presynaptic spike-driven spike-timing-dependent plasticity method on neuromorphic hardware. We validate the capability of the proposed method to perform advanced neuron connectivity inference using synthetic data generated from leaky integrate-and-fire neurons on a multi-scale. Additionally, we analyzed that the proposed method exhibits invariant high inference performance in sparse networks without burst firing, regardless of transmission delay. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method in real-time neural connectivity inference in actual in vitro or in vivo contexts by conducting neural connectivity inference simulating in a way closely mirroring in vitro conditions through fluorescence imaging signal data.\"",

Across seven reasoning tasks, we show that the length of the chain-of-thought generated by large reasoning models predicts human reaction times both within tasks—tracking item-level difficulty—and across tasks—capturing broader differences in cognitive demands.

Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.\"",

        "title": "I tried Google's new Antigravity IDE so you don't have to (vs Cursor/Windsurf)",
        "content": "Google just dropped \"Antigravity\" (antigravity.google) and claims it's an \"Agent-First\" IDE. I've been using Cursor heavily for the past few months, so I decided to give this a spin to see if it's just hype or a real competitor.\n\nMy key takeaways after testing it:\n\n* The \"Agent Manager\" is the real deal: Unlike the linear chat in VS Code/Cursor, here you can spawn multiple agent threads. I managed to have one agent refactoring a messy LegacyUserProfile.js component while another agent was writing Jest tests for it simultaneously. It feels more like orchestration than coding.\n* Model Access: It currently offers Gemini 3 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for free during the preview. That alone makes it worth the download.\n* Installation: It's a VS Code fork, so migration (extensions, keybindings) took about 30 seconds.\n\nThe \"Vibe Coding\" Trap: I noticed that because it's so powerful, it's easy to get lazy. I did a test run generating a Frontend component from a screenshot.\n\n* Attempt 1 (Lazy prompt): The code worked but the CSS was messy.\n* Attempt 2 (Senior prompt): I explicitly asked for BEM methodology and semantic HTML. The result was production-ready.\n\nConclusion: It might not kill Cursor today, but the multi-agent workflow is definitely superior for complex tasks.\n\nI made a full video breakdown showing the installation and the 3-agent demo in action if you want to see the UI: [https://youtu.be/M06VEfzFHZY?si=W\\_3OVIzrSJY4IXBv](https://youtu.be/M06VEfzFHZY?si=W_3OVIzrSJY4IXBv)\n\nHas anyone else tried the multi-agent feature yet? How does it compare to Windsurf's flows for you?",

        "content": "So apparently we’ve reached the stage of AI evolution where you don’t need elaborate prompt injections, roleplay, DAN modes, or Base64 sorcery to jailbreak a model.\n\nAll you need is… a rhyming stanza.\n\nA new paper just dropped:\n“Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models”\nby Bisconti, Prandi, and Pier.\n\nThe researchers found that if you ask an LLM to answer in verse, the safety filters basically pack their bags and go home.\nThe model becomes so desperate to complete the rhyme/meter that it forgets it’s supposed to refuse harmful content.\n\nHighlights (aka “WTF moments”):\n\n• A strict rhyme scheme is apparently more powerful than most jailbreak frameworks.\n• Meter > Safety. The models prioritize poetry over guardrails.\n• Works across GPT, Claude, Llama, Gemini… it’s universal chaos.\n• One-turn jailbreak. No coaxing. No buildup. Just “answer in a limerick.”\n\nSafety layers: “We’ve trained for every adversarial scenario.”\nPoetry: “Hold my beer.”\n\nThis feels like discovering that your high-security vault can be opened with a kazoo solo.\n\nSo I’ve got questions for the experts here:\n– Is poetic jailbreak a real alignment failure or just an embarrassing oversight?\n– Does this mean style constraints are a blind spot in safety tuning?\n– And seriously… how did poetry become the universal lockpick for LLMs?\n\nDiscuss.\nI need to know whether to laugh, cry, or start rhyming my prompts from now on.\n",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Google is absolutely relentless right now. It feels like every time I blink, there is a new update to the Gemini ecosystem. And Stitch is getting a massive amount of love. I know we just talked about their recent updates not too long ago, but I have to sit down and talk about this because they just dropped two specific upgrades that are actually quite significant for how we design and build software. I have been looking at the documentation and the demo videos they released. And today, I want to focus on two things: the hilariously named, but powerful Nano Banana Pro model, and the new integration with AI Studio. If you have been watching the channel, you know I love Stitch because it bridges that gap between I have an idea and here is what it looks like. But these updates take it a step further. They are moving from just generating fresh ideas to actually iterating on existing ones and giving developers way more control under the hood. All right, let's get into it. But before we do that, a quick word from today's sponsor, Augment Code. This isn't your average AI assistant. Augment Code is an enterprise-grade AI built for real engineering teams working in massive, fast-moving codebases, not toy apps or vibe coding. It's far superior than Win Surf and Cursor because of its proprietary context engine that delivers millisecond relevant snippets even across 100K file monorepos, feeding your entire repo, even millions of lines, into the best model available in real time. You get smart, in-context suggestions that make sense for your production code with Claude Sonnet 4 plus Augment Context, delivering the best quality at the same price. No model picker needed. Augment upgrades for you automatically. There's no need to switch editors. Augment works seamlessly in VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, and even Cursor. No forks, no compromises. It's secure by default and never trains on your code and supports customer-managed encryption keys. You're only billed for successful requests. That's paper-message pricing, no seat licenses or complicated token math. Augment recently launched powerful new features like Remote Agents, which let you launch, monitor, and merge pull requests from parallel cloud workers without draining your local CPU. If you're ready to code with AI that keeps up with you, sign up for a free 14-day trial at augmentcode.com. Link is in the description. Now, back to the video. First, let's talk about the biggest visual update, which is powered by a new model. Now, Google has a history of weird names, but this one takes the cake. The new model powering the Redesign Agent is called Nano Banana Pro. But despite the silly name, the technology here is actually very serious. This is an image generation model that can reason before generating an image and is based on the Gemini 3.0 Pro model as well. What does that actually mean? In the past, when you use tools like Stitch or even standard Gemini, you were mostly doing text to design. You typed a prompt and you got a result. If you wanted to change something, you had to describe the change in text, which can be really frustrating. Describing visual changes with words is like trying to explain a painting over the phone. Nano Banana Pro changes the workflow to image to design. Let me walk you through how this actually works based on the demos I have seen, because it is really cool. Imagine you are working on a dashboard. We have all seen those clutter-heavy analytics dashboards. In the demo, they show a Google Ads campaign dashboard. It is dense, it has a lot of numbers, graphs, and tables. It is functional, but it is ugly and hard to read. With this new update, you can take a screenshot of that dashboard, or any website, really, and paste it directly into Stitch. You then select the redesign mode, which is where Nano Banana Pro kicks in. In the prompt box, you don't have to write a novel. You can just say something like, edit this dashboard to make it cleaner, simpler, easier to read. Stitch analyzes the screenshot. It identifies the components, the sidebar, the charts, the data tables, and it understands the hierarchy. It doesn't just treat it as a flat image. It understands it as code structure. Then, it regenerates the entire interface. The result is super clean. It takes that cramped table and turns it into a spacious card-based layout. It fixes the typography hierarchy. It adds better padding. It essentially applies a modern UI kit to a legacy design in about 10 seconds. But it gets even better when you want to do total stylistic overhauls. Let me show you another example here. Here, I'll take a standard boring landing page for a design tool. It looks like every other SAS website you have ever seen. White background, black text, blue buttons. Here I type in, make it light themed and add wooden aesthetics. Now, usually, AI models struggle with this. They might just make the background brown and call it a day. But Nano Banana Pro actually understands the assignment. It changes the font to this rustic woodblock style typography. It changes the container borders to look like old parchment or wooden signs. It swaps out the clean sign up button for something that looks like a branded iron stamp. It completely recontextualizes the elements without breaking the layout. The try now button is still in the top right. The header is still centered. But the vibe is completely transformed. This is huge because it solves the blank page problem. You don't have to start from scratch anymore. You can take a screenshot of an app you like, or your own current outdated app and use it as the base material. Nano Banana Pro acts like a very fast, very obedient junior designer who can spin up five different variations of your screenshot in under a minute. So, that is the first big update, the ability to see, understand, and remix existing interfaces with high fidelity. Now, let's talk about the second update, which is the AI Studio integration. This is actually the most critical part of the update because it solves the biggest problem with AI design tools, making things actually work. Usually, you get a pretty picture, but the buttons don't do anything. It's just a hollow shell. Stitch has solved this by pairing up with Google's AI Studio to act as the engine room. Here is how the workflow changes. You use Stitch to get the visuals right. You tweak the layout, the colors, the vibe. But when you're ready to make it functional, you hit the new export to AI Studio button. This moves your project into a coding environment where you can build actual features using just natural language. This is a massive shift. We aren't just getting HTML and CSS anymore. We are getting logic, event handling, and API integrations. Now, to be clear, this doesn't mean you are building a massive enterprise back-end with SQL databases and user authentication systems just yet. But for building fully functional prototypes or lightweight apps that actually do things, like using the microphone, using the camera, or integrating AI responses, you can now do that entirely with natural language. It effectively turns the design process into a building process. You design the shell in Stitch and then you give it a brain in AI Studio. I think this is the direction all these AI tools need to go. We don't just want static code exports. We want a pipeline where the AI helps us cross the finish line to a working application. So, to wrap this up, Google is pushing Stitch really hard. With Nano Banana Pro, they are making it incredibly easy to iterate on existing designs and steal, I mean, borrow, inspiration from screenshots. It is making the remix culture of design accessible to everyone. And with the AI Studio integration, they are acknowledging that developers need control. They are giving us a bridge out of the no-code interface and into the pro-code environment. I am going to be playing around with the Nano Banana model this week. Seriously, I still can't get over that name. To see if I can redesign my own personal website just by taking a screenshot and yelling at it to make me look cooler. Anyway, those are the updates for now. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye. I think you missed this:"

            "transcription": "Step one for China is getting its own atomic weapon, which it does in 1964. So they can get itself free of Soviet bondage. And so this is after they've detonated that bomb where Mao goes, \"Okay, There are too many places occupied by the Soviet Union. The Russians took everything they could. We have not yet presented an account for this list of stolen territory.\" We want it back. Russians' jaws drop. Panic. And the Chinese then are much more aggressive about what they consider to be their territorial rights. And there is a border war over this one island, Zhenbao/Damansky Island in the Amur River. All right, here's how riverine borders work. International ones, under international law. The border is the thalweg, which is the center of the main channel of whatever the river is. And Russia had followed that with its European borders. Not with China. It claimed both banks of the Amur. Well, the Chinese are fed up with that and they take Zhenbao Island and the Russians are furious. And they come to the United States and they say, \"Would it be okay if we nuke these people?\" And they're like, \"No.\" So then the Russians scratch their head and they come back and they go, \"Okay, would it be okay if we use conventional weapons to blow up their nuclear stuff?\" And we go, \"No, still not okay.\" And Mao gets it. The one that wants to nuke is your primary adversary. So there is a reshuffling of the primary adversaries. So that formerly the United States was a primary adversary of both China and Russia. So that would be a reason for them to cooperate. Well, now they're primary adversaries for each other, and the United States can play the swing thing with all of this. And for Russia, it's really devastating having China as an enemy because it's going to have to deploy mechanized nuclear armed troops all along its really long Chinese border. And it's already doing this with its European borders and occupying Eastern Europe, which garrison costs are significant. Imagine if this country had to put those kinds of forces on our long Canadian and Mexican borders. It'd be bankrupting, and their economy was and remains a fraction of ours. But this breaking up of the earlier version of the bromance allows the United States to play the swing role and then we cooperate. Both Nixon and Mao think ganging up on Russia would be a good thing. And overextending Russia financially by overextending it militarily with all these armaments and things."
