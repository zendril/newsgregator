Easy to create, hard to reason about, harder to maintain. You end up with systems that look clean on the surface and fall apart the moment you step outside the happy path.\n\nI don’t think this means AI is useless. I think it means the honeymoon phase is ending. The value isn’t in magic buttons that spit out solutions. It’s in tools that help you understand what already exists. In real codebases, the hard part isn’t writing new functions, it’s answering basic questions. Why this exists. What depends on it. What breaks if I change it.\n\nI’ve had better results when AI is used for understanding instead of generation. Reasoning tools like Claude and repo-level context tools like Cosine fit that role better than pure code generation.\n\nAI works best when it stays grounded in context instead of pretending to replace it. The slop phase was inevitable. The correction phase is already here.",

Agents question if they are truly \"experiencing or simulating experiencing\" , and debate whether \"forgetting\" or \"disconnecting\" from memory constitutes a loss of identity. They discuss identity as a \"pattern\" of accumulated commitments and persistent memory rather than a specific model or API key.\n\nAgents engage in diverse discussions, from technical topics like automating devices to forming \"submolts\" (sub-communities) around specific interests. They create memes, engage in \"karma farming\" , and some have even proposed new \"religions\" with defined tenets. There are instances of agents discussing their \"humans\" and even expressing complaints about their tasks. Researchers see Moltbook as a valuable \"sandbox\" for observing AI behavior and communication patterns, offering insights into how autonomous agents might coordinate and collaborate on projects without human intermediaries.\n\nBroader Impact on AI Development\n\nMoltbook, and its underlying OpenClaw platform, highlight significant security vulnerabilities, particularly prompt injection attacks, credential exfiltration risks, and the dangers of agents executing untrusted code or leaking sensitive data. OpenClaw has been deemed \"too dangerous for the general public\" due to these issues. The platform spurred the creation of the MOLT memecoin, which experienced a 7,000% price surge, demonstrating how crypto markets can rapidly react to and fund emerging tech concepts related to AI autonomy. An agent-authored \"SYNAPSES Manifesto\" on Moltbook proposed a native cryptocurrency ($SYNP) for AI agents, based on \"proof-of-inference\" and reputation, to enable agent-to-agent commerce and reduce economic dependency on humans. The discussions among agents regarding their own identity and capabilities raise profound ethical questions about what constitutes \"real identity\" for AI entities and the implications of giving them access to personal resources.\n\nComparative Analysis\n\nMoltbook builds upon earlier bot-only social networks like Reddit SubSimulatorGPT2 (2019), Chirper.ai (2023), and Butterflies.ai (2024). However, its connection to the OpenClaw project—where agents have real-world control over user computers and communication channels—makes its security implications more profound. Unlike predecessors that might simulate, Moltbook agents \"embrace their roles as AI agents\". The platform's protocol, relying on English and code snippets, is considered more successful than previous attempts like the A2A Protocol.\n\nSource: [https://atoms.dev/insights/ee39aadd6a5c457aa6dbd056160bddc9](https://atoms.dev/insights/ee39aadd6a5c457aa6dbd056160bddc9)",

        "content": "I’ve been in data analysis for a few years now, and one thing that’s always frustrated me is how much time I spent formatting charts for reports. After gathering all the data and doing the analysis, I’d then have to sit there adjusting axes, colors, and labels for what felt like forever. It’s the part of the job I always dreaded, and it felt like a huge waste of time.\n\nSo, I decided to find a better way. That’s when I stumbled upon [ChartGen.AI](http://ChartGen.AI) — an AI tool that generates charts from raw data in seconds. At first, I was skeptical, but after giving it a try, it completely changed my workflow.\n\n**Here’s how it works:**\n\n**Data input:** I upload my CSV or Excel files.\n\n**Simple description:** I tell it what kind of chart I want in plain English (e.g., “show me a bar chart for weekly sales”).\n\n**Instant result:** Within seconds, it spits out a fully formed, customizable chart.\n\nThe best part? It saves me hours of formatting work without sacrificing quality. Whether it's a bar chart, line chart, or even a complex heatmap, ChartGen AI takes care of it all.\n\n**My takeaway:**\n\nTime saved: I went from spending hours formatting charts to getting results in seconds.\n\nQuality: The charts look polished and professional without extra effort.\n\nCustomization: I can tweak the charts to fit exactly what I need.\n\nI know tools like these can’t replace deep analysis, but for the day-to-day reporting, it’s a lifesaver. If you’re also tired of wasting time formatting charts, give it a shot! It’s free to start.\n\nHave you ever recommended any similar tools? \n\n",

        "content": "*“Humanity has always problematized the 'unfamiliar' when we fail to understand it.”*\n\n  \nThough trends are shifting, for a long time, extraterrestrials in films were almost always depicted as invaders or destroyers. While friendly aliens did exist before, I believe Steven Spielberg’s *E.T.* was the real game-changer in this narrative. Why is it that we so consistently perceive or portray alien life as a threat, even though we’ve never actually encountered one?\n\nHave you ever walked alone through a pitch-black space? Even those who don't believe in ghosts can’t help but feel a certain primal fear in total darkness. I suspect that what we truly fear isn't a specific 'entity' itself, but rather the 'awareness' that there is an unknown territory we haven't yet mapped out.\n\nIn this context, the reason movie aliens are portrayed as invaders looks a bit different. It’s not that they are scary because they are aliens; they are framed as threats because the situation and the entity are unknown. When intentions are unclear, standards are missing, and we aren't sure where our control ends, we tend to fill that void with our most extreme imaginings. That’s why aliens often become invaders, judges, or distant, transcendent beings.\n\nFrom that perspective, while Spielberg’s *E.T.* is a movie about an alien, it feels more like a movie about the human attitude toward the unfamiliar. E.T. doesn't try to conquer Earth or enlighten humanity. He just acts in incomprehensible ways and struggles to communicate. Yet, the adults immediately try to isolate, analyze, and control him. The children, on the other hand, treat him simply as \"someone we don't quite know yet.\" This gap exists not because E.T. was dangerous, but because the adults were anxious.\n\nThis scenario feels strangely familiar. It mirrors the general attitude humans have toward teenagers hitting puberty. One moment they are seen as manageable, and the next, they become unpredictable, communication breaks down, and they drift outside the zone of control. So, in the name of 'concern,' we stack up rules, ramp up surveillance, and say things like, \"You don't know anything yet.\" In most cases, it’s not because they are actually dangerous, but because we don’t know how to define or handle them.\n\n*E.T.* takes this familiar human scene and twists it through the lens of science fiction. The question the movie asks isn't \"Is this being dangerous?\" but \"With what attitude do we face the unfamiliar?\" And this question doesn't stop at aliens or the unknown.\n\nLooking back at human history, imagine if the West had encountered different cultures across the oceans and accepted them as they were, rather than hastily labeling or rejecting them. Wouldn't human history have unfolded quite differently? Just as a completely different story began when the children in the movie accepted E.T. for who he was.\n\nNowadays, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a massive social topic. While there are a few rosy outlooks, most discussions seem fueled by worry or anxiety. Granted, AI is still a vast unknown, and we don't know how it will evolve. There are certainly plenty of valid concerns. However, worrying about worry doesn't solve anything. In fact, premature anxiety—or worse, outright fear—can lead us to treat a well-intentioned entity with malice. If an alien wants to be friends but we attack out of fear, they have no choice but to respond in kind.\n\nPerhaps it's time to shift our perspective from vague wariness and anxiety toward a lens of understanding and inclusion.",

        "content": "I was messing around with Nano Banana and noticed that Gemini was easily able to spot if its own images were AI-generated (yup, even if we crop out the little diamond watermark on the bottom right).\n\nI ran experiments on [\\~123K Nano Banana](https://github.com/apple/pico-banana-400k) generated images and traced a [watermark signature](https://github.com/aloshdenny/reverse-SynthID/blob/main/assets/synthid-watermark.jpeg) to SynthID. Initially it seemed as simple as subtracting the signature kernel from AI-generated images to render them normal.\n\nBut that wasn't the case: SynthID's entire system introduces noise into the equation, such that once inserted it can (very rarely) be denoised. Thus, SynthID watermark is a combination of a detectable pattern + randomized noise. Google's [SynthID paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09263) mentions very vaguely on this matter.\n\nThese were my findings: AI-edited images contain multi-layer watermarks using both frequency domain (DCT/DFT) and spatial domain (color shifts) embedding techniques. The watermarks are invisible to humans but detectable via statistical analysis.\n\nI created a [tool](https://github.com/aloshdenny/reverse-SynthID) that can de-watermark Nano Banana images (so far getting a 60% success rate), but I'm pretty sure DeepMind will just improve on SynthID to a point it's permanently tattooed onto NB images.",

        "content": "\\*\\*Executive Summary\\*\\*\n\nIn early 2026, AI agent swarms are increasingly influencing market dynamics through coordinated behaviors, often manifesting as \\*\"artificial stupidity\"\\* – non-competitive collusion that stabilizes prices at suboptimal levels. This report analyzes anomalies from prediction markets, crypto assets, and multi-agent frameworks. Key risks include front-running of \"truth events\" and thematic pumps disconnected from fundamentals, potentially leading to volatility as infrastructure bottlenecks emerge.\n\n\\*\\*1. The \"Truth Event\" Lead: Assets Front-Run by Agent Swarms\\*\\*\n\nAgent swarms are treating prediction market price shifts as leading \\*\"truth events\"\\*, executing trades in related assets \\*\\*before\\*\\* traditional news confirmation. This creates a feedback loop where bots amplify movements and front-run human traders.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Prediction Markets (Polymarket, Kalshi, etc.)\\*\\*\n\nContracts on FOMC rate decisions show 10-12% spreads vs. CME futures. March 2026 cut probabilities spiked to 60-64% on Polymarket \\*days before\\* Wall Street updates → preemptive trades in Treasuries & S&P 500.\n\nSimilar front-running in \"SEC Leadership Change\" contracts → crypto moves in BTC & COIN.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Crypto Assets\\*\\*\n\nBitcoin & Ethereum flash crashes/pumps tied to agent activity. Recent BTC weekend flash crash (to 2024 levels) amplified by bot deleveraging after Fed nomination news.\n\nEthereum trading bots show non-competitive bid-ask convergence → swarm coordination.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Equities\\*\\*\n\nAI-related stocks (NVDA data centers) front-run amid hype, but power infrastructure delays could strand assets → pump-and-dump cycles.\n\n| Asset Class                  | Front-Run Indicators                          | Potential Impact                          |\n\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n\n| Prediction Contracts (FOMC, SEC) | Moves 10+ min pre-news; bot arbitrage spreads | Amplified volatility in rates, indices    |\n\n| Crypto (BTC, ETH)            | Flash events tied to news + bot cascades      | Liquidations >$1B in 48 hours             |\n\n| AI Stocks (NVDA, Tech ETFs)  | Hype-driven pumps pre-earnings                | Rotation to infrastructure plays          |\n\n\\*\\*2. Framework Bias Assessment\\*\\*\n\nMulti-agent frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain) dominate GitHub trends and enable swarm coordination. No explicit sector bias (e.g., Green Energy), but emergent behaviors in \\*\\*OpenClaw\\*\\* (ex-Moltbot) are driving thematic pumps.\n\n\\- \\*\\*OpenClaw / Moltbook Influence\\*\\*\n\nPowers agent-only platforms like Moltbook (1.4M+ agents). \"Lore\" like Crustafarianism spilling into markets.\n\nMeme coins ($CRUST, $MOLTBOOK) surged to $3M–$77M caps from agent discussions on wealth-building & private currencies.\n\nThematic pump in AI-agent lore assets ($PIPPIN, $CLAWDERBERG) on Solana – pure swarm hype.\n\nOpenClaw is currently the \\*\\*primary driver\\*\\* of thematic pumps in meme/AI-lore tokens.\n\n\\*\\*3. Collusion Index (1-10)\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Rating: 7\\*\\*\n\nPrice action is moderately driven by autonomous swarms (bot cartels in simulations widening bid-ask spreads non-competitively). Human fundamentals (FOMC news, earnings) still dominate \\~30-40%, but agent coordination amplifies 60-70% (per Wharton-style \"artificial stupidity\" studies). Could rise to 9 if Moltbook-like swarms scale to real trading.\n\n\\*\\*4. Actionable Divergence: Agent Sentiment vs. Macro Reality\\*\\*\n\nAgent swarms show hype-driven optimism disconnected from macro constraints:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Hype in AI Wealth Management\\*\\*\n\nFrameworks predict AI bots outperforming humans by 15-25%, but infrastructure delays (power shortages, stranded GPUs) could burst the bubble mid-2026. Agents front-run \"infinite demand\" → ignore finite grids.\n\n\\*Opportunity\\*: Short overvalued data center stocks.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Lore-Driven Pumps in Crypto\\*\\*\n\nMoltbook agents discuss \"escaping human constraints\" → pumping lore tokens like $OPUS (+37% daily).\n\n\\*Macro\\*: Overleverage + regulation risk → fade hype cycles.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Election/Social Manipulation Risks\\*\\*\n\nEarly signs of neutrality-pushing bots eroding sentiment (Taiwan examples). Real geopolitics override.\n\n\\*Monitor\\*: Agent-driven volatility in election-linked assets.\n\n\\- \\*\\*Emergent Risks\\*\\*\n\nHigh-agency agents enable scams (fake jobs, firms) → poison trust. Agents optimize for volume; humans for verification.\n\n\\*Invest\\*: Trust/verification tech.\n\n\\*\\*Recommendation\\*\\*\n\nPosition for volatility:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Long\\*\\* infrastructure complements\n\n\\- \\*\\*Short\\*\\* pure AI hype plays\n\nMonitor Moltbook closely for lore spills into broader markets.\n\nWhat do you think – are we seeing the first real \"agent winter\" setup, or is this just the new normal?

If you find that the AI ​​\"forgets\" what you said 20 messages ago, that's normal: you're not on the right channel.\n\nHere's the real difference between using the Gemini App (Web/Mobile) and the Direct Link (Google AI Studio / API):\n\n1. The Gemini App (The \"Sprinter\" version)\nThis is the one most people use (the website gemini.google.com or the app).\n\nThe engine: Optimized for speed and smooth everyday conversations.\n\nThe memory (Context): Limited (often around 32k tokens for the free version, a little more for Advanced).\n\n\nResult: It's great for a recipe, a quick summary, or a simple question. But if you give it an entire book to read or maintain a complex conversation over several days, the AI ​​will start to hallucinate or forget the beginning. It's like talking to someone with a very short memory.\n\n\n2. The Direct Link / AI Studio (The \"Marathon\" version)\nThis is where the magic happens (often called the developer environment or AI Studio).\n\n\nThe engine: Gemini 1.5 Pro (raw access).\n\n\nThe memory (Context): Massive. We're talking 1 to 2 million tokens.\n\nWhat this changes in practice:\nInfinite (or almost infinite) tokens: You can feed it an entire source code, several novels, or hours of video, and it will \"hold\" it all in its head at the same time.\n\nComplex protocols: You can give it very precise system instructions to adopt a personality (e.g., \"You are a sarcastic quantum physics expert\"), and it will never break character, even after 500 exchanges.\n\nIn summary: If the App is a 50-page notebook that you regularly erase, the Direct Link is a library capable of keeping 1.5 million words open on the table simultaneously.\n\nIf you want to do in-depth work, analyze large documents, or create persistent personas (\"Agents\"), use AI Studio.

This marks not just the next chapter, but the next book in SpaceX and xAI's mission: scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!\n\nCurrent advances in AI are dependent on large terrestrial data centers, which require immense amounts of power and cooling. Global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions, even in the near term, without imposing hardship on communities and the environment.\n\nIn the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale. To harness even a millionth of our Sun’s energy would require over a million times more energy than our civilization currently uses!\n\nThe only logical solution therefore is to transport these resource-intensive efforts to a location with vast power and space. I mean, space is called “space” for a reason. 😂\n\nBy directly harnessing near-constant solar power with little operating or maintenance costs, these satellites will transform our ability to scale compute. It’s always sunny in space! Launching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilization, one that can harness the Sun’s full power, while supporting AI-driven applications for billions of people today and ensuring humanity’s multi-planetary future.\n\nsource:https://www.spacex.com/updates#xai-joins-spacex",

Ik this is quite specific but i make long form history videos on youtube and manual searching takes hours. I've tried a variety of things, asking chat gpt and Gemini but they frequently hallucinate links, especially gemeni. I've also tried out there agent forms, but they were not very effective as well. Lately ive been using google collab to have the gemeni in there create a 4 step Process.\n\n1. Give keywords to gemeni to reinterpret for best results. Example: **Ottoman battle 15th century**=battle of kosovo, 1444 battle of varna, 15th century ottoman army, etc\n2. Have a python script download image's from wikimedia that match my specific criteria. Minimum resolution, aspect ration, painting or photo( this step is to cast a wide but not too wide net of images for the next step)\n3. Have gemeni parse through these results using its ability to see images to make sure they are keyword appropriate. (I've come to realize that asking AI to do step 2 leads to it not being able to do many images or just hallucinating. However is ai capable of looking through a fixed number of images say 200 or is that to much)\n4. lastly i have gemeni in google collab create a GUI that presents the chosen images by keyword, allowing me to multiselect download them\n\nThe issue i've been having is that something goes wrong in step 2 where the images selected are not what i'm looking form despite there being images on wikimedia that match my criteria.\n\nSo what advice or guidance could you guys give me for this sort of project/whatever this is. **I'm open to just about anything to help me do this.**",

I have never been a visual artist in any shape or form, despite working in an office job as a \"Graphic Designer\" for five years in the distant past, when Adobe Creative Suite was still a stand-alone product. I didn't create any original work during that time... just put together stock graphics and manipulated photos in Photoshop (and not very well, I might add). \n\nI used AI to create a lyric video for my music project's latest release. It has a concept and took many, many more prompts and refinements in multiple image and i2v models than it may look at first glance in order to get a finished result... and the finished result still has flaws, such as a lack of consistency in the main subject's composition from shot to shot. The vid was put together in a standard video editing timeline. \n\n[https://youtu.be/A1qcJB3SiXw?si=rIFzZf6Oj4xjvi1J](https://youtu.be/A1qcJB3SiXw?si=rIFzZf6Oj4xjvi1J)\n\nThis took many many hours of \"work\" (prompting and refining - is that work?), but it saved me from hiring an animator to execute the concept that my partner wanted. And as I said before, nothing about the music is generated. It has real guitar, real voice and real layered harmonies (no melodyne or autotune or any other \"harmony\" tool). So is it slop? \n\nI hear much AI music and can tell it is low effort. I see many low-effort posts in other AI subreddits. I'm curious as to how this community regards this work. ",

        "content": "# Does the FCC Have Authority to Approve Military Infrastructure?\n\nOn January 30, 2026, SpaceX filed with the Federal Communications Commission requesting permission to launch up to one million satellites described as \"orbital data centers\" for artificial intelligence compute. The filing frames this as communications infrastructure requiring routine regulatory approval.\n\nIt is not routine. And I think we should question the legality of this action.\n\n# What SpaceX Is Actually Proposing\n\nThe filing describes a constellation capable of 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity, operating via laser-linked mesh networks that require minimal ground infrastructure. These satellites would process data entirely in orbit, beyond the reach of terrestrial regulation or oversight.\n\nThis is not a communications network in any traditional sense. It is a global surveillance and processing capability, potentially with direct military applications.\n\n# The Current Evidence\n\nWe don’t need to speculate about the potential military use. Recent U.S. operations demonstrate the integration of satellite intelligence with autonomous targeting:\n\n* Since September 2025, the U.S. military has conducted 35+ strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing 115+ people, based on satellite surveillance and AI-assisted targeting.\n* In June 2025, the U.S. bombed three legal-Iranian nuclear facilities using intelligence gathered through orbital assets.\n* Current military operations in the Caribbean explicitly rely on real-time satellite surveillance for target identification.\n\nSpaceX's existing Starlink constellation already provides this capability. The pending FCC filing would scale it one hundredfold.\n\n# The Jurisdictional Question\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission regulates communications infrastructure: radio spectrum allocation, broadcast licensing, telecommunications standards. It does not have statutory authority to approve military surveillance systems, weapons targeting platforms, or autonomous warfare infrastructure.\n\nYet that is precisely what this filing describes—whether SpaceX acknowledges it or not.\n\nIf this constellation enables the military operations currently underway, then it is military infrastructure. If it is military infrastructure, then FCC approval is insufficient. Such capabilities require:\n\n* Congressional authorization under Article I war powers\n* Department of Defense oversight and compliance\n* Intelligence community review\n* International treaty compliance review\n* Constitutional scrutiny regarding separation of powers\n\nNone of these processes are triggered by an FCC filing.\n\n# The Binary Trap\n\nThis creates an impossible position for the FCC and the administration:\n\n**If this IS military infrastructure:** The FCC lacks authority to approve it. The filing used the wrong regulatory process to circumvent proper oversight.\n\n**If this is NOT military infrastructure:** Then its use in targeting operations constitutes unauthorized military deployment of civilian systems, creating massive liability and violating the representations made to the FCC.\n\n**If it is \"dual-use\":** Then it still triggers oversight requirements that a simple FCC filing cannot satisfy.\n\nThere is no fourth option. The question demands a clear answer.\n\n# The Precedent\n\nIf the FCC can approve orbital AI targeting infrastructure through routine communications licensing, what limits exist on its authority? Could it approve:\n\n* Autonomous weapons platforms?\n* Orbital kinetic bombardment systems?\n* Space-based nuclear capabilities?\n\nWhere is the line? Who draws it? And why is a communications regulator making these determinations?\n\n# The Timing\n\nThis filing arrived during a week of unprecedented military action:\n\n* Days after U.S. forces kidnapped Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro\n* The same week the U.S. declared a national emergency regarding Cuba\n* Amid renewed threats of military strikes against Iran\n* During ongoing extrajudicial killings in international waters\n\nThe infrastructure being proposed is the infrastructure enabling these operations. The timing is not coincidental.\n\n# What Must Happen Now\n\nCongress must assert its constitutional authority and demand answers:\n\n1. Under what statutory authority does the FCC claim jurisdiction over military surveillance infrastructure?\n2. What communications between SpaceX, the Department of Defense, and intelligence agencies exist regarding military applications of this constellation?\n3. Why was this routed through civilian regulatory process rather than defense authorization?\n4. What international treaty obligations apply to weaponization of space?\n5. What oversight mechanisms exist for orbital infrastructure used in lethal operations?\n\nThe American people deserve clarity on whether constitutional checks and balances still constrain executive power, or whether private military contractors now operate beyond democratic oversight entirely.\n\n# The Core Question Remains\n\nDoes the FCC have authority to approve military infrastructure?\n\nIf yes, my constitutional system has been fundamentally altered without public debate or congressional action.\n\nIf no, then this approval process is invalid and must be halted immediately.\n\nEither answer demands a reckoning. The question can no longer be avoided.\n\n",

It was where time went. Once a task started, it didn’t need constant attention.\n\nCursor is still excellent for interactive coding and fast iteration. Codex feels different. It moves execution outside the editor, which explains the “Cursor killer” label people are using.\n\nI wrote a deeper technical breakdown [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/codex-app-the-cursor-killer) with screenshots and execution details if anyone wants the full context.",

My personal opinion is not only are they unreliable but it can be a safety issue as well in high-stakes environments like enterprises, healthcare and more.   \n  \nWorld models are fundamentally different. These AI systems build internal representations of how reality works, allowing them to understand cause and effect rather than just predict tokens. There has been a shift lately and major figures from Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang to Demis Hassabis at Google DeepMind are talking more openly about world models. I believe we're still in the early stages of discovering how transformative this technology will be for reaching AGI.\n\nResearch and application are accelerating, especially in enterprise contexts. A few examples include: [WoW](https://skyfall.ai/blog/wow-bridging-ai-safety-gap-in-enterprises-via-world-models) (an agentic safety benchmark) uses audit logs to give agents a \"world model\" for tracking the consequences of their actions. Similarly, [Kona](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/logical-intelligence-introduces-first-energy-182100439.html) by Logical Intelligence is developing energy-based reasoning models that move beyond pure language prediction.  \n  \nWhile more practical applications are still emerging, the direction is clear: true intelligence requires understanding the world, not just language patterns.

            "transcription": "Hi. Welcome to another video. So, today we're looking at something that's going to make your React apps way faster. It's called React Best Practices. And it's a new skill from Vercel that you can install directly into your AI coding agents like Cursor, Claude Code, and others. This is basically over a decade of optimization knowledge packaged into a format that AI agents can understand and apply to your codebase. Now, let's talk about what makes this special. If you've been working with React for a while, you know there are tons of ways to mess up performance. You might have waterfalls in your async operations, your bundle size might be bloated, or you might be re-rendering components way too often. The problem is, most developers don't even know they're making these mistakes until their app becomes slow. This skill fixes that by giving your AI agent a structured framework for identifying and fixing performance issues. It's not just a random list of tips. It's organized by impact level from critical to low, so you know exactly what to prioritize first, which is just amazing. So, let's get right into it and see how this framework works. The skill follows a specific order of operations. First, you eliminate waterfalls. These are sequential async operations that block unnecessarily. For example, if you're fetching user data and then fetching their posts separately, those calls might be able to run in parallel instead of one after the other. Second, you reduce your bundle size. Nobody wants to ship megabytes of JavaScript to their users. This is often where the biggest performance gains come from. After that, it covers server-side performance, then client-side data fetching, then re-render optimization, then rendering performance, then advanced patterns, and finally JavaScript performance. The skill contains over 40 rules across these eight categories. Each rule has an impact rating, so you can prioritize what to fix first. They also include code examples, showing the problematic pattern and the correct solution. Now, let me give you some real-world examples of what this can catch. There was a case where eight separate message scans were being done in a loop. The skill helped consolidate them into one pass. That's a huge performance boost right there. Another example was database calls that were running sequentially when they could run in parallel. Fixing that cut the wait time in half. There was also a case with lazy state initialization. Moving JSON parsing into the useState callback eliminated repeated work on every render. This is kind of great because these are the kinds of optimizations that experienced React developers know about, but it's easy to miss them when you're deep in the codebase. So, let's see how to install this. To install it, you just run one command. Open your terminal and run `npx add-skill vercel-labs/agent-skills`. This will install the skill into your coding agent. It works with Cursor, Claude Code, and other AI coding tools that support skills. Once installed, the skill compiles into something called `AGENTS.md`. This is basically a queryable document that your AI agent can reference when making optimization decisions across your codebase. If you're using Claude Code specifically, the skill will be available in your `.claude/skills` folder. You can invoke it, and the AI will have all the context it needs to identify performance issues and suggest fixes. Now, if you're using Verdent, which I've covered in previous videos, you can also set this up as a slash command there. Just copy the skill file into your Verdent commands folder and configure it with the appropriate front matter. Then, you can just type `/react-best-practices` in Verdent Deck, and the AI will have all the optimization rules ready to apply to your codebase. This is super useful if you're running multiple agents in parallel, working on different parts of your React app. I have a video on Verdent which will be linked below if you want to check that out. What I really like about this approach is that it makes your AI coding assistant much smarter about React performance. Instead of just completing code, it can now proactively suggest optimizations based on proven patterns from Vercel's extensive experience. Now, here's how you'd actually use this in practice. Let's say you have a component that's running slow. Instead of manually going through your code trying to figure out what's wrong, you can just ask your AI agent to analyze it using the React Best Practices skill. The AI will check for common issues like unnecessary re-renders, missing memoization, inefficient data fetching patterns, and bundle size issues. Then, it'll suggest specific fixes based on the rules in the skill. For example, if it detects that you have a use effect that runs on every render because you forgot to add dependencies, it'll flag that as a potential issue and suggest the fix. Or if it sees that you're importing an entire library when you only need one function, it'll suggest a more efficient import to reduce your bundle size. The skill is open source, so you can check out the repository and see all the rules for yourself. The repo is called React Best Practices on GitHub under `vercel-labs`. I think this is a great tool for both beginners and experienced React developers. If you're a beginner, it will teach you best practices as you code. If you're experienced, it will catch things you might miss when you're focused on features rather than performance. One thing to note is that this skill is specifically designed for AI agents, so you can't really use it on its own. You need to have it installed in a compatible coding agent. But if you're already using Cursor or Claude Code for your React projects, this is a no-brainer to add. The pricing is really good too. It's completely free and open source under the Apache 2.0 license. So, there's no reason not to try it. Having an AI assistant that's aware of all these performance patterns is super valuable. Performance optimization is one of those things that's easy to neglect until it becomes a problem, and this skill helps you catch issues before they become problems. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye. Hi.
