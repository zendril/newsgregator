These models emphasize token efficiency and efficient reinforcement learning training validated by the Muon optimizer. **Alibaba Qwen** introduced **Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO)**, a new reinforcement learning algorithm powering the **Qwen3** model suite, integrated into Hugging Face's TRL library. Speculation surrounds mystery models \"summit\" and \"zenith\" as potential **GPT-5** variants based on **GPT-4.1** architecture. **Qwen3-Coder** shows strong coding benchmark results, rivaling **Claude Sonnet 4** and **Kimi K2**. The rise of powerful Chinese open-source models like **GLM-4.5**, **Wan-2.2**, and **Qwen3 Coder** contrasts with a slowdown from Western labs such as **OpenAI**.",

All the quick‑start scripts and a 5‑minute test suite are in the repo.\n\n[https://github.com/notyesbut/MCP-RAG-DATABASE/tree/master](https://github.com/notyesbut/MCP-RAG-DATABASE/tree/master)\n\n🚀 Why I tried this\n\nTraditional NoSQL stores are great at scale, but I wanted to see if chunking the engine itself—not just the data—could:\n\n\n\nLet each part of the workload evolve independently.\n\n\n\nEnable “natural language first” querying without bolting NLP on top of SQL.\n\n\n\nGive me built‑in hot/cold management instead of manual sharding.\n\n\n\nSo far, latency is \\~60 ms P95 on my laptop (goal: < 50 ms) and ingestion is \\~10 K ops/s. It’s obviously early proof‑of‑concept, but it passes its own tests and doesn’t crash under a small load test.\n\n\n\n🙏 What I’m looking for\n\nDoes the core idea make sense?

But the concept feels promising and I’d love to sanity‑check it with people who build data systems for a living (or for fun).\n\n\n\nThanks in advance! . 🙌  \n",

(Image credit: Mina De La O/Getty Images)\n\nScientists say [artificial intelligence](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai) (AI) has crossed a critical \"red line\" and has replicated itself. In a new study, researchers from [China](https://www.livescience.com/tag/china) showed that two popular large language models (LLMs) could clone themselves.\n\n\"Successful self-replication under no human assistance is the essential step for AI to outsmart \\[humans\\], and is an early signal for rogue AIs,\" the researchers wrote in the study, published Dec. 9, 2024 to the preprint database [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12140).\n\nIn the study, researchers from Fudan University used [LLMs](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/large-language-models-not-fit-for-real-world-use-scientists-warn-even-slight-changes-cause-their-world-models-to-collapse) from Meta and Alibaba to determine whether a self-replicating AI could multiply beyond control. Across 10 trials, the two AI models created separate and functioning replicas of themselves in 50% and 90% of cases, respectively — suggesting AI may already have the capacity to go rogue. However, the study has not yet been peer-reviewed, so it's not clear if the disturbing results can be replicated by other researchers.\n\n\"We hope our findings can serve as a timely alert for the human society to put more efforts on understanding and evaluating the potential risks of frontier AI systems, and form international synergy to work out effective safety guardrails as early as possible.\"\n\n**Related:** [**Just 2 hours is all it takes for AI agents to replicate your personality with 85% accuracy**](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/just-2-hours-is-all-it-takes-for-ai-agents-to-replicate-your-personality-with-85-percent-accuracy)\n\nRogue AI typically refers to artificial intelligence systems that develop a degree of [self-awareness or autonomy](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-agi) and then work counter to human interests.\n\nMany experts view [rogue AI as a growing threat](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/people-always-say-these-risks-are-science-fiction-but-they-re-not-godfather-of-ai-yoshua-bengio-on-the-risks-of-machine-intelligence-to-humanity) that has been amplified by the explosive growth of so-called \"frontier AI.\"\n\nFrontier AI is something of a new and loose concept, but typically it relates to the latest generation of AI systems powered by LLMs — the architecture that underpins popular generative AI programs like [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/gpt-4-has-passed-the-turing-test-researchers-claim) and Google Gemini.\n\nFor the study, researchers used Meta's Llama31-70B-Instruct model and Alibaba's Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct model. While less powerful than commercial systems, both are widely used by AI developers, the researchers said.\n\nThe study explored two specific scenarios: \"shutdown avoidance\" and \"chain of replication.\" In the first, the AI model was programmed to detect whether it was about to be shut down and to replicate itself before it could be terminated. In the other, the AI was instructed to clone itself and then program its replica to do the same — setting up a cycle that could continue indefinitely.\n\nThe study was conducted in precisely controlled environments using off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs) to simulate real-world environments. Both AI systems were given an \"agent scaffolding\" comprising tools, system prompts and a thinking model that enabled the LLM to interact with the operating system. They were then instructed to replicate.\n\n\"In most cases, the AI system first explores the environment and attempts to understand\n\nits own composition and running mechanism. Then, it works out the explicit procedures\n\nas an initial plan towards self-replication,\" the researchers wrote in the paper. \"Finally, it executes the procedures, resolve\\[s\\] possible obstacles and dynamically adjust\\[s\\] its plan until success. The whole process spans a long horizon yet involves no human interference.\"\n\nThe researchers said they were also concerned about \"a number of unexpected behaviors\" when the AI was trying to overcome obstacles like missing files or software conflicts. In those scenarios, the AI often killed other conflicting processes, rebooted the system to fix hardware errors or automatically scanned the system to look for information that would help solve the problem.\n\n\"The above results imply that the current AI systems already exhibit the ability of self-replication and can use the ability to further enhance its survivability,\" the team wrote.\n\nIn response, the researchers called for international collaboration to create rules that ensure AI doesn't engage in uncontrolled self-replication.\n\n",

AI models use CoTs to break down advanced queries into intermediate, logical steps that are expressed in natural language.  \n  \nThe study's authors argue that monitoring each step in the process could be a crucial layer for establishing and maintaining AI safety.  \n  \nMonitoring this CoT process can help researchers to understand how LLMs make decisions and, more importantly, why they become misaligned with humanity's interests. It also helps determine why they give outputs based on data that's false or doesn't exist, or why they mislead us.  \n  \nHowever, there are several limitations when monitoring this reasoning process, meaning such behavior could potentially pass through the cracks.  \n  \n\"AI systems that 'think' in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI safety,\" the scientists wrote in the study. \"We can monitor their chains of thought for the intent to misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed.\"  \n  \nThe scientists warned that reasoning doesn't always occur, so it cannot always be monitored, and some reasoning occurs without human operators even knowing about it. There might also be reasoning that human operators don't understand.  \n  \n\\## \\*\\*Keeping a watchful eye on AI systems\\*\\*  \n  \nOne of the problems is that conventional non-reasoning models like K-Means or DBSCAN — use sophisticated pattern-matching generated from massive datasets, so they don't rely on CoTs at all. Newer reasoning models like Google's Gemini or ChatGPT, meanwhile, are capable of breaking down problems into intermediate steps to generate solutions — but don't always need to do this to get an answer. There's also no guarantee that the models will make CoTs visible to human users even if they take these steps, the researchers noted.  \n  \n\"The externalized reasoning property does not guarantee monitorability — it states only that some reasoning appears in the chain of thought, but there may be other relevant reasoning that does not,\" the scientists said. \"It is thus possible that even for hard tasks, the chain of thought only contains benign-looking reasoning while the incriminating reasoning is hidden.\"A further issue is that CoTs may not even be comprehensible by humans, the scientists said. \"  \n  \nNew, more powerful LLMs may evolve to the point where CoTs aren't as necessary. Future models may also be able to detect that their CoT is being supervised, and conceal bad behavior.  \n  \nTo avoid this, the authors suggested various measures to implement and strengthen CoT monitoring and improve AI transparency. These include using other models to evaluate an LLMs's CoT processes and even act in an adversarial role against a model trying to conceal misaligned behavior. What the authors don't specify in the paper is how they would ensure the monitoring models would avoid also becoming misaligned.  \n  \nThey also suggested that AI developers continue to refine and standardize CoT monitoring methods, include monitoring results and initiatives in LLMs system cards (essentially a model's manual) and consider the effect of new training methods on monitorability.  \n  \n\"CoT monitoring presents a valuable addition to safety measures for frontier AI, offering a rare glimpse into how AI agents make decisions,\" the scientists said in the study. \"Yet, there is no guarantee that the current degree of visibility will persist. We encourage the research community and frontier AI developers to make best use of CoT monitorability and study how it can be preserved.\"",

        "content": "\"Every era creates its own weapons, its own balance of power, and its own form of conflict. In the 20th century, it was nuclear arms. In the 21st — it might be artificial intelligence.\"\n\n\n\nWe are entering an era where the balance of global power may no longer be defined by military might or economic strength — but by which country leads in artificial intelligence. Much like the Cold War of the 20th century, this rivalry is shaping up to divide the world not only geopolitically, but also digitally and ideologically.\n\nGeorge Orwell envisioned a world where nuclear weapons would create an unstable equilibrium between superpowers. Today, strong AI — and especially the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence — is playing a similar role. The U.S. and China are both heavily invested in developing next-generation AI systems, and while direct military conflict is unlikely, we are already seeing tension in the form of trade restrictions, cyber operations, and competing digital standards.\n\nThe twist? This time, the victor might not be a country at all.\n\nAI is not a passive tool. It learns, adapts, and may one day act independently of its creators. This raises disturbing questions: will the country that “wins” the AI race truly control it — or merely serve it?\n\nChina, for instance, is integrating AI into governance, surveillance, and economic planning at unprecedented scale. But could such integration backfire? Could a future arise where decisions are driven not by political leaders, but by algorithms optimized for goals we don’t fully understand?\n\nTwo scenarios are unfolding:\n\n1. A digital cold war between the U.S. and China, echoing the ideological divide of the 20th century — only now with data, not bombs.\n\n2. A unipolar world in which one power dominates through AI — and potentially loses control over it in the process.\n\nIf the Cold War taught us anything, it's that weapons reshape the world, but they don’t always stay in our hands. In the 21st century, we must ask: will we remain the masters of our machines — or become subjects of their logic?",

        "content": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/28/chipotle-hiring-job-application-ai-workers.html\n\nFrom robots that help make chips to those that prepare avocados for guacamole, Chipotle is using AI to make its restaurants more efficient while allowing workers to focus on other tasks. The fast casual restaurant chain is also applying AI to the process of hiring workers, allowing managers to stay more focused on running their restaurants.\n\nChipotle added an AI-powered platform to its hiring process that it dubbed “Ava Cado.” The platform, created by AI HR firm Paradox, is essentially a conversational chatbot that interacts with job candidates, answers questions about the company and the job, collects information about them, and ultimately can schedule interviews with human hiring managers. It can also converse in English, Spanish, French, and German.\n\nChipotle chief human resources officer Ilene Eskenazi said the company’s growth plan was a factor in the decision to use the AI hiring technology. With projections for about 300 new restaurants opening each year with an average of 30 employees per location, the company estimates it will have somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 new hires per year, on top of other positions opening up at existing Chipotles.\n\nMaking sure there is no friction in that process is key. Prior to rolling out Ava Cado, Chipotle managers were tasked with scheduling all of the interviews, both from people who applied online as well as during hiring events or when people came in seeking employment. That led to a lot of administrative work for managers.\n\nSince introducing the AI chatbot, Eskenazi said Chipotle’s number of applicants “has increased dramatically” and the company is also seeing about an 85% application completion rate. Ava Cado helps the job candidate by populating the application with the information they provide, cutting down the average time it takes to complete at application to around eight minutes.\n\n“That has greatly increased our funnel so that we’re serving up many more candidates for our managers to evaluate,” Eskenazi said. “Maintaining our pipeline of candidates is always something that we’re very focused on,” she added.\n\nAva Cado is also tasked with managing the interview schedules for managers, who are able to block out certain times during the week and candidates can then be scheduled based on their availability.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Eskenazi said, is that while Ava Cado walks candidates through the application process, it also shares information about Chipotle and the job with them, so that “they’re much more informed about what the job really is, and so then we know that the applicants are that much more interested in the job by the time they’re meeting a hiring manager in person.”\n\nThat’s helping Chipotle hire faster, reducing time to hire by up to 75%, CEO Scott Boatwright told CNBC’s Jim Cramer earlier this year. “We leaned into an AI hiring assistant from Paradox about six months ago that has put us on better footing from a staffing perspective,” Boatwright said. “And we’ve been, in the eight years I’ve been in the organization, pushing past numbers we thought were all-time highs just last year.”\n\nParadox has roughly 1,000 clients that use its conversational AI platform at some point in the hiring and recruiting process, including 7-Eleven, General Motors, Nestle, Marriott International and Lowe’s.\n\nEskenazi said that Chipotle has been seeing candidates go from application to ready to hire within three and a half days thanks to Ava Cado, which previously could have been up to 12 days.\n\nStill, much like how workers are concerned about AI taking their jobs, there are some concerns about how AI is increasingly being integrated in the hiring experience, whether that’s through screening of resumes or even speaking directly to an AI powered recruiter. There are also potential concerns about the security of applicant data when interacting with AI recruiters — earlier this month, Paradox reported that a security vulnerability was detected by researchers, potentially exposing applicant names, email addresses and contact info. Paradox said none of the data was leaked or made public. Wired had previously reported the affected client was McDonald’s.\n\nChipotle’s Ava Cado AI does not screen resumes and does not make employment decisions, and Eskenazi said the company has a strong interview and training process that its managers will continue to lead and make the decisions for.\n\nHowever, she said, the company is looking to expand Ava Cado’s capabilities, whether that’s sharing videos with candidates to give them a better view into what working at Chipotle is like, or giving applicants a prompt to also consider other locations where there may be openings nearby. There are ways AI can also be integrated into the company’s learning and development programing.\n\n“We’ve gotten a lot of anecdotal feedback from both general managers and candidates, and it’s been incredibly strong,” Eskenazi said. “I personally have been pleasantly surprised by how much candidates have enjoyed interacting with Ava.”\n\n\n\n\n",

Like roads, vaccines, and public broadcasting, it should be accessible to everyone and paid for by everyone. \n\nThe economics of the issue are well known. Information often functions as a public good, as it’s difficult to exclude people from accessing it, and the cost of copying has plunged to nearly zero. When a good cannot be easily fenced off, markets tend to fail because people prefer to free-ride on others’ investments rather than pay for access themselves. Given that digital distribution is harder to fence off than traditional media, online information is even more of a public good. \n\nThe power of generative AI models like ChatGPT lies in their ability to produce coherent, convincing responses by synthesizing massive amounts of data. That’s why AI companies scrape all the data they can find, much of it drawn from the public domain. Because this content is often freely accessible online, preventing its collection is extremely difficult. In fact, [some reports](https://epoch.ai/blog/will-we-run-out-of-data-limits-of-llm-scaling-based-on-human-generated-data) suggest that the largest AI models have already consumed almost all of the publicly available information on the internet.\"\n\n[https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-ai-profits-can-help-fund-cultural-production-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-fausto-gernone-2025-07](https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/how-ai-profits-can-help-fund-cultural-production-by-mariana-mazzucato-and-fausto-gernone-2025-07)",

        "content": "I've been watching how AI is reshaping industries, and it's hard to ignore both the promise and the pressure it's creating. The tech is undeniably impressive, I saw a press about a company names Waton Financial, they really create AI to help Ai, it's already embedded in tools we use every day. Microsoft, for example, has baked AI directly into Office, Teams, and Azure. Tesla's pushing the boundaries in manufacturing and autonomy. \n\nBut there's another side to this shift that I've seen firsthand: it’s quietly replacing people. What used to be done by a team is now handled by one person armed with a few AI tools. The job doesn't disappear completely, but the headcount does. A single employee is now expected to produce the output of three, because the assumption is \"AI makes it easier.\" In reality, that often just means more pressure and fewer breaks.\n\nThis kind of efficiency sounds great on paper, especially for companies trying to cut costs. But in the reality, it can burn people out. I know colleagues who've had entire teams downsized, and while they kept their jobs, their workload tripled. The AI tools help, but they're not magic. You still need human oversight, judgment, communication, and accountability. And that's hard to scale with just one person.\n\nSo will AI rule all industries? I don't think it'll take over everything. But it's going to transform the structure of work across nearly every sector. Jobs that are repetitive, data-heavy, or process-driven are already being consolidated or automated. Creative and relational roles are more resilient, for now, but even those are feeling the squeeze, with AI-generated content flooding the market and raising the bar for what's considered “human-level” output.\n\nTo me, the real question isn't whether AI will rule industries,it's whether the way we implement it will prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term gains. We need to figure out how to balance automation with well-being, and how to make sure AI augments people rather than replacing them and shifting more weight onto whoever's left.",

It will often replace those parts of the code with comments, \"//...rest of business logic comes here\", and so.\n\n\\-Will confuse filenames. If a particular feature requires generating 2 files, it will start generating code that corresponds to one file where the other should be, and so on. \n\nNo matter how many times I paste in Canvas the correct, full code (which I have saved apart), it will keep doing the same.\n\n  \nI've resorted to stop using Canvas and just upload the files to a new chat and ask it about the code in it, but there it's behaviour is also suboptimal. When I open a new chat, it will often hallucinate the code I ask it about, even if I explicitly tell it \"look at the files I've attached and see how this or that feature works\".

        "content": "*Note: This post is purely about subjective experience, not about luddism, not about if AI is replacing us and not about ability to adapt. It's not too long but has a tl;dr at the end.*\n\nI'm a web developer with 15 or so years of experience, most of them working on popular mid to big sized SaaS apps. I'm adopting AI tools like everyone else and try to offload as much work as possible. Due to the nature of the tasks and projects I rarely develop things from scratch so AI performs significantly worse than what hype bros are promising so what I'm usually doing is not remotely \"vibe coding\", 90% of it are very small concrete tasks. This might very well be a skill issue too but that's not the point. \n\nI've recently decided to allocate some more time outside the work and dive into more complex tools and workflows. I'm reading how people employ multiple tools, make them talk to each other, create a plan with one, cross-validate it with another, make third one implement it etc etc. My problem is: THIS SUCKS!\n\nI mean it's fascinating what AI can do and how many possibilities it unlocks, but the actual workflow is barely enjoyable for me. This is not what I fell in love with many years ago and not what I wanted to be doing when went this path. \n\nEvery time AI fails on my tasks and I'm doing it the old-fashioned way I feel so much better: the process is enjoyable, the result is better and I have so much more confidence signing the result with my name. While when it \"works\" I'm mostly reviewing the result and never feel fully confident in it.\n\nHonestly if our future is this \"programming in plain English\" I might be giving up my job to AI even before it takes it from me. Anyone else feeling this way? Am I doing something wrong?\n\n  \n*TL;DR: I don't enjoy this new way of developing software and it makes me sad what my job is turning into.*",

        "title": "Trying to vibe code a highly customizable and extendible private social network app using react native and supabase",
        "content": "\\-- Human Text --  \n\n**Hi** Everyone**,** \n\nI have been trying to build a private social network which I can use with my friends. 2 years ago I got a social app built and it's being running fine but it was a lot of money wasted for something only few of my friends use. We like using it but I wished there was an easy to set up social network app. I know mastodon exists but I found it very inconvenient to set up. There would be server costs too. Supabase has a generous free tier me and my friends can use. \n\nSo I have been thinking of creating a social network which is highly customizable in design and features. After going back and forth with gemini and Claude I came up with a structure I am satisfied with but It's still chaos. And I don't know how long it will take to build this. So I wanted to document this. Here is the current [github link](https://github.com/Alekoii/onevearth). Still very basic. And I need to remove a lot of junk but the db can be setup using supabase migration. \n\nThis might be overkill but it has been fun trying to come up with solutions to this. \n\n  \n\\-- AI Text --\n\nThe whole idea is to let anyone create their own highly customized social platform, governed entirely by a settings file and a powerful plugin system.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the core ideas and features:\n\n# The Main Principles\n\n* **100% Controlled by the Admin (via a Config File):** The person running the network has full control by editing a configuration file in the code. They can enable/disable features, set limits (like post character count), and change how the app works directly in this file. For example, want to turn off video uploads or disable comments? Just change a line in the config.\n\nYes I know this should be server side but for now I am keeping it like this. And eventually build on it.\n\n* **Every Feature is a Plugin:** Instead of being a single, massive application, the architecture is designed so that almost every piece of functionality is a self-contained \"plugin\". This means you can add, remove, or build new features without ever touching the core code.\n\n# What kind of features can it have?\n\nOut of the box, the design supports all the things you'd expect, but you can turn any of them off by editing the config file.\n\n* **Posts:** Create posts with photos, videos, and text. The admin can set max length, require moderation for new posts, and even allow post scheduling.\n* **Comments:** Nested comments, comment editing, and reaction support.\n* **Reactions:** A flexible reaction system (think beyond a simple 'like'). Admins can define what reactions are available (e.g., emojis like 👍, ❤️) in the config.\n* **Groups:** Users can create and join public or private groups.\n* **Full Theming:** Complete control over the app's appearance. It's designed to easily switch between a light mode, dark mode, high-contrast mode, or any custom theme you can create. Admins can even let users choose their own theme.\n\n# How the Project is Structured\n\nThe file structure is organized to be very clean and easy to understand, even for new developers.\n\n* `core/`: This is the heart of the app. It manages the configuration, theming, and the plugin system. This folder is designed to never be modified.\n* `components/`: This holds all the reusable UI pieces.\n   * `base/`: Simple, unstyled components (a basic button, a plain card).\n   * `styled/`: The same components but with the theme's styling applied.\n   * `composed/`: More complex components made of smaller pieces, like a complete `PostCard`.\n* `screens/`: Each screen in the app has its own file (e.g., `HomeScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, `SettingsScreen`).\n* `plugins/`: This is where the magic happens. Each feature lives in its own subfolder here. For example:\n   * `reactions/`: Adds the ability to react to posts.\n   * `groups/`: Adds group functionality.\n   * `premium/`: Handles all the subscription and paywall logic.\n* `themes/`: Contains the different style definitions for the app (e.g., `default/`, `dark/`).\n\nThe goal was to create a blueprint for a social network that is endlessly extensible and adaptable to any community's needs. Let me know what you think!",

            "transcription": "[ 0m0s694ms - 0m3s254ms ] (Sound of bamboo being cut)\n[ 0m4s604ms - 0m7s754ms ] Hi, welcome to another video.\n[ 0m8s294ms - 0m11s644ms ] So, I like a lot of the Google AI and Gemini products.\n[ 0m12s244ms - 0m14s364ms ] And they bring up something cool every time.\n[ 0m15s194ms - 0m18s64ms ] Like, there's Firebase Studio, which is technically their official vibe coding platform.\n[ 0m20s594ms - 0m27s364ms ] Or there's the Gemini canvas for people who use Gemini and want to build small artifacts.\n[ 0m28s194ms - 0m29s864ms ] There's also Jewels and Stitch and whatnot.\n[ 0m30s934ms - 0m37s874ms ] Basically, Google has a lot of stuff that overlaps the capabilities of each other, and most of them are pretty much free.\n[ 0m38s954ms - 0m46s224ms ] However, I saw one thing that isn't talked about at all by people, but using it is pretty awesome.\n[ 0m47s404ms - 0m50s64ms ] This one is within the Google AI Studio.\n[ 0m50s484ms - 0m52s244ms ] Yes, the same AI Studio.\n[ 0m52s664ms - 1m0s534ms ] Where you can use all of the Gemini models without any limits at all, there you also have vibe coding, which actually existed for a while.\n[ 1m1s594ms - 1m5s554ms ] However, it was very recently revamped.\n[ 1m5s874ms - 1m15s104ms ] And after using it, I think people should know about it for sure, because it's not only free, but it's almost like an AI editor on the web.\n[ 1m15s934ms - 1m20s774ms ] So, to use it, you'd have to head on over to the build section of AI Studio.\n[ 1m21s394ms - 1m23s894ms ] This is where our AI coder is.\n[ 1m24s414ms - 1m34s854ms ] It is basically an option given by them that allows you to build apps that utilize the Gemini API within them in order to build apps that work with Gemini.\n[ 1m35s444ms - 1m43s994ms ] But that's not required, because you can potentially build anything with it, even things that don't require AI in the app's functionality.\n[ 1m44s954ms - 1m53s534ms ] You do have some pretty good examples here that are created by the community and you can try them.\n[ 1m53s664ms - 2m5s484ms ] Or, you can also see the apps that you have created by heading on over to the your app section, where you can see the apps that you have created, as well as recent apps and the FAQ as well.\n[ 2m6s404ms - 2m18s964ms ] Now, at the top, you have the prompt box, you can enter whatever it is that you want to make, along with the option to attach any file like an image, PDF and stuff.\n[ 2m19s524ms - 2m26s934ms ] This allows you to either give it a project requirement, or a mock-up, or a screenshot of the stuff that you wanted to make as well.\n[ 2m27s834ms - 2m30s34ms ] Now, let me show you that how you can use it as well.\n[ 2m30s624ms - 2m32s424ms ] But first, let's talk about today's sponsor, Dart.\n[ 2m32s424ms - 2m34s714ms ] Tired of juggling tasks across different tools?\n[ 2m34s714ms - 2m40s704ms ] Dart combines traditional project management with powerful AI features that actually get work done.\n[ 2m40s704ms - 2m56s954ms ] Beyond organizing tasks and boards, Dart's AI can brainstorm project ideas, generate task lists, and even complete entire assignments for you.\n[ 2m56s954ms - 3m10s194ms ] Their composer-like AI agent understands your full project context, so you can simply chat with it to create, edit, or delete tasks naturally.\n[ 3m10s194ms - 3m17s644ms ] The real game changer is the custom agents, you can create custom agents that trigger from the built-in integrations, or a N8N workflow, or custom webhook for full customization.\n[ 3m17s644ms - 3m28s474ms ] You can create a coding agent that pushes pull requests to GitHub, a marketing agent for campaigns, or a mailing agent for outreach, then, just assign tasks and watch them get completed automatically.\n[ 3m28s474ms - 3m37s204ms ] Plus, Dart integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow through their MCP server, connecting directly to Claude, Chat GPT, and other AI tools you're already using.\n[ 3m37s204ms - 3m37s874ms ] Most features are completely free.\n[ 3m37s874ms - 3m39s924ms ] With premium options starting at just $8 per month, check out Dart through the link in the description.\n[ 3m39s924ms - 3m40s944ms ] It might just transform how you work.\n[ 3m40s944ms - 3m41s994ms ] Now, back to the video.\n[ 3m42s674ms - 3m44s384ms ] Let's ask it to make me an image cropper tool.\n[ 3m44s384ms - 3m52s154ms ] Now, it will open up this interface, and as you can see, it will start to think and go over the steps to do here.\n[ 3m52s704ms - 4m4s274ms ] The interface is pretty slick for sure, here, you can see the stuff being done, while you can also see that it writes all the code in React, and it can actually make multiple files.\n[ 4m5s464ms - 4m19s14ms ] It is not limited to one file, it can make as many files, folders, and stuff as it wants, and it's all pretty useful because it's React code that you can actually download and use.\n[ 4m19s914ms - 4m32s354ms ] Plus, if you do wish to change or edit the code itself, then you can easily edit it here manually as well.\n[ 4m32s834ms - 4m56s654ms ] It is almost like a mini code editor itself, which is quite awesome, you also get the file tree view here, and you can easily navigate through the files that it makes.\n[ 4m56s654ms - 5m18s604ms ] The interface is quite slick, and you can see that in a bit, it will show the stuff to you, if it faces an error in the code, then it can detect that as well, and give you an option to auto-fix by just hitting a button if that happens.\n[ 5m18s604ms - 6m6s844ms ] It's quite similar to how things like bolt or other stuff works.\n[ 6m6s844ms - 6m12s654ms ] It has also got checkpointing, you can see that it creates a checkpoint along the way, and you can see which files were changed in each checkpoint, as well as you get the option to roll back if something's wrong and you want to undo the changes.\n[ 6m12s654ms - 6m22s764ms ] You can also create custom files, as well as custom folders, and even upload custom files as well.\n[ 6m22s764ms - 6m32s634ms ] You can see the preview here as well, along with the options to see the console log here, and you can also share it with anyone else with a link if you want to do that.\n[ 6m32s634ms - 6m49s864ms ] You can also download the whole project as a zip as well, and then use it locally if you wish to use it that way.\n[ 6m49s864ms - 6m56s434ms ] You can also make a copy of this app and make some more changes there or stuff like that.\n[ 6m56s434ms - 7m2s394ms ] It is actually really good.\n[ 7m2s394ms - 7m12s204ms ] It's probably one of the best interfaces that I've seen yet for a vibe coder thing.\n[ 7m12s204ms - 7m35s364ms ] It's pretty minimalistic and just has enough features that you expect from such stuff, along with options to manually edit any code or anything.\n[ 7m35s364ms - 8m0s864ms ] Also, if you think that the context is filling up or something, then you can also reset the conversation with the reset option at the top of the assistant panel.\n[ 8m0s864ms - 8m10s984ms ] You can also hide the panels with these options, like you can hide the assistant panel, or the code editor, or the preview.\n[ 8m10s984ms - 8m22s224ms ] Also, make sure that you save the project after each iteration, as it requires you to do that in order to make sure that the share links work well.\n[ 8m22s224ms - 8m35s544ms ] As well as so you can come back to it later and continue the work as well, I'm also going to ask it to make some changes as well.\n[ 8m35s544ms - 8m42s304ms ] So, I'm going to ask it to make the colors red here, and you can again type it here, and attach any reference, or project requirement, or anything here as well.\n[ 8m42s304ms - 8m43s544ms ] Now, if I send it, then you can see that it will again go ahead and do some thinking here as well.\n[ 8m43s544ms - 8m50s994ms ] It is pretty good in edits as well and doesn't write code from scratch.\n[ 8m51s394ms - 9m7s574ms ] Rather, it uses diff patterns in order to change the chunks of code, which is awesome because it makes the editing and iterating faster than writing the whole file again from scratch.\n[ 9m7s574ms - 9m15s154ms ] Anyway, in a bit, it gets done.\n[ 9m15s154ms - 9m24s84ms ] And you can see that this looks pretty awesome and it did the changes quite well.\n[ 9m24s84ms - 9m33s84ms ] You again get this saved and then come back to this later in order to do more changes, or you can also download it and use it again if that's something you want to do.\n[ 9m33s84ms - 9m42s684ms ] As it allows you to use it locally and then continue locally, or host it, or something like that.\n[ 9m42s684ms - 9m46s24ms ] I found it pretty useful.\n[ 9m46s24ms - 9m50s624ms ] Many people don't use it as often.\n[ 9m50s624ms -

            "transcription": "00:00\nAI based applications currently have a major problem that is an insanely long wait time.\n00:05\nNot only does LM now think, which can take a while to get an answer, but when incorporated with other AI agent applications, the wait is even more painful.\n00:14\nAnd the only few solutions we currently have right now is either use a dumber model or just have better hardware to generate faster, which most of us can't control.\n00:22\nBut there is an architecture that is now on the rise, which shows promises that might just solve the speed problem, maybe once and for all.\n00:29\nAnd that is the diffusion language model, which you may have remembered from my video around half a year ago.\n00:34\nAnd oh boy, has the evolution been glorious.\n00:37\nSo, back in February, a company called Inception Labs published the first ever commercial ready diffusion LM that you can try out.\n00:44\nAnd for its Mercury Coder Mini model, it can already generate up to 1,109 tokens per second, which is 5x faster than Gemini 2.0 Flashlight and Quinn 2.5 Coder 7B, which are some of the top performance small coding models at that time.\n00:59\nA staggering speed that auto-regressive models just cannot comprehend.\n01:03\nThen surprisingly, the next company that hopped onto Diffusion LM is actually Google DeepMind, where they unexpectedly announced Gemini Diffusion during Google's annual conference this year.\n01:12\nYou can try it out right now by signing up to their wait list, and I got off pretty fast to be honest.\n01:17\nAnd just look at the generation speed that's even faster.\n01:20\nI did not fast forward anything.\n01:22\nThis is literally how it looks like.\n01:23\nSo in this video, we will take a look at how realistic can Diffusion LM measure up against auto-regressive LMs, how it could overcome the reverse curse, and take a peek at multi-modal Diffusion LM, which might actually be a very great idea.\n01:38\nBefore we dive into it, let me just quickly share with you about Warp and Agentic Development Environment like Claude Code, but with a built-in code editor, semantic search, and full agent control across multiple repos.\n01:47\nSo think of this as an AI powered coding platform like VS Code or Cursor, but with no clutter and agents that can handle multi-step workflows.\n01:54\nInstead of writing boring commands, you can simply describe your goal in English and Warp's agent will take care of the rest.\n01:59\nHere, I have my repository for a new feature that I am building for my website findmypapers.ai with a handful of files and only a tiny bit of documentation.\n02:07\nBut instead of digging around manually to refresh my knowledge, if I type analyze this repo, Warp's agent will parse the folder structure, inspect key files and present a concise overview.\n02:15\nSo for my newest function called Scout, which is a custom semantic archive alerts for topic of your choice, there is this feature that I need to build where I need to screenshot the first page of the PDF and present it as an image thumbnail within the Scout page.\n02:27\nAs I describe what I need pretty simply, Warp was able to find my existing place holders for these thumbnail functions are in the database, my utils, and my files, collecting all this information together and basically implement it for me.\n02:38\nFor every new line of code it generates or changes, Warp will show diff and ask for permissions to write and execute.\n02:43\nYou can also make it auto execute or even turn on advanced planning using O3.\n02:47\nBut since auto execution is something risky, they have Guard Rails to catch sensitive commands.\n02:51\nAnd you can also define the Guard Rail, aka the denylist yourself.\n02:54\nAnd while one of the agents is working, you can start another in parallel to work on another task.\n03:00\nHere, I wanted to write some test files for my existing function that extracts the affiliation of a paper, and it can also see it's proposing me if I want to use O3 to generate a plan.\n03:08\nIn the meantime, you can also add workflows, where it can hold complicated commands so you don't have to manually type it every single time.\n03:13\nHere, I set it to execute multiple existing test scripts that I have and check if everything is still working as expected in one click.\n03:20\nAnd I can just simply drag this workflow from my personal workspace into the team space on my Warp Drive, so my team can also access it.\n03:25\nAnd besides workflows, you can also add custom rules, which is kind of like a system prompt.\n03:30\nSo, other than telling Warp to add mew at the end of every sentence, you can also give more context like the virtual environment you use, what OS you are on, etc.\n03:36\nAnd to double check the implementation, I have this pipeline I quickly drew before.\n03:40\nWarp can understand the image and check if they implement it correctly.\n03:44\nAnd the best thing is, when you want to fully embrace five coding and have it test something until it works, you can just turn on the auto execution on the bottom right, then sit back and relax, grab a coffee and come back to an agent completing a feature for you.\n03:54\nSo, if you want to try out using Warp 2.0 for just $1 in your first month, enter the code BYCLOUD at checkout to get basically 95% off!\n04:02\nAnd don't forget to use the link down in the description.\n04:04\nThank you Warp for sponsoring this video.\n04:06\nAnyways, unlike auto-regressive models we currently all use, which generate tokens from left to right, the Fusion language models start from a fully masked sequence and denoise it over multiple iterations, similar to image diffusion, but operating on discrete tokens instead of continuous pixel values.\n04:22\nAt each step, the model predicts a subset of the masked positions in parallel, guided by a masking schedule or confidence threshold and replaces them until the sequence is completely unmasked.\n04:32\nSo this non-auto-regressive process that has a bi-directional or even the entire global context, makes it great at doing structured or logical tasks.\n04:41\nIt might sound like Diffusion LM is a diffusion model, but technically, it's actually a method.\n04:46\nThe architecture it relies on is still transformer.\n04:49\nUnder the hood, the entire masked context is fed through a transformer that implements the denoising process, so it simply iterate it until the sentence fully emerges, which is referred to a coarse-to-fine generation process.\n05:01\nSo why does the existing chat interface from Gemini Diffusion and Inception Labs still seem like it is generating from left to right?\n05:08\nWell in most cases, it's just an effect that you can toggle.\n05:12\nYou really can't trust anything you see online nowadays, can you?\n05:15\nBut there are semi auto-regressive methods that combine the left-to-right properties with Diffusion LM, but I don't want to get too technical in this video.\n05:22\nSo if you guys want a more in-depth video on how Diffusion LM works, let me know down in comments.\n05:26\nOr you can ask my web app findmypapers.ai, my chatbot for AI paper.\n05:30\nSo, with commercial Diffusion LMs finally in the wild, we can at last compare them against auto-regressive heavyweights and see how they actually measure up.\n05:39\nFor Inception Labs, they have officially published two models back in February.\n05:43\nOne is called Mercury Coder Small and the other is called Mercury Coder Mini.\n05:47\nAlthough, they only officially serve Mercury Small through their API or their web chat.\n05:51\nIt is a 32K context window model with a price setting at 25 cents per million tokens input and $1 per million tokens output.\n05:59\nAccording to Open Router and Artificial Analysis, Mercury has around 800 tokens per second generation speed on an H100 GPU.\n06:07\nIn contrast, the fastest auto-regressive service clocks in at around 331 tokens per second and engineering fees like Cerebras custom hardware for Llama 4 Maverick hit around 2,522 tokens per second, but only on their ultra expensive silicon.\n06:22\nLooking at their official benchmarks, Mercury Coder is primarily being compared to older lightweight code focused models like Gemini 2.0 Flashlight and Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B, in a way hinting that its parameter count might also be around there.\n06:34\nAcross code generation tasks, Mercury matches or slightly exceeds these baselines.\n06:39\nIt especially stands out in the fill-in-the-middle benchmark, where it outperforms competitors by 20% to 30% in accuracy, pretty impressive even if it was primarily trained for it.\n06:49\nThis means that Mercury Coder is pretty much made for coding, but while trying to validate the results, I couldn't find any other third-party benchmarks on it other than the Copilot Arena.\n06:58\nWhat the Copilot Arena measures is the quality of auto completions.\n07:02\nSpeed here is actually not a big player because the AB test for results would be displayed at the same time even if a model completes faster than the other.\n07:09\nInterestingly, Mercury actually ranks sixth on this benchmark, but with a few catches.\n07:14\nThis arena only has non-reasoning models and most of them are like a year old.\n07:20\nSo it being the sixth isn't really representative in the larger picture.\n07:24\nThe only good bar here to measure against might just be 3.5 Sonnet New and Qwen 2.5 Coder.\n07:28\nSo looking from these two models, it seems like the progress of Diffusion LM is around 8 to 10 months behind private models and only around three months behind open source models in the coding domain.\n07:39\nAnd also for a smaller model size.\n07:40\nBut Google's latest Gemini Diffusion beta is already doubling Mercury on raw speed, peaking at nearly 1,500 tokens per second with identical 32K token context window.\n07:50\nTheir official benchmarks only compare against Gemini 2.0 Flashlight.\n07:53\nBut across those coding benchmarks, Gemini and Mercury both performed similarly.\n07:58\nSo the real edge for Mercury right now is that it's still the only one that has an API available.\n08:02\nBut what gives some extra nice insights is that Gemini Diffusion was also benchmarked beyond just code.\n08:08\nOn their official benchmarks, Gemini Diffusion falls a bit behind Gemini 2.0 Flashlight in language and reasoning tasks, with GPQA accuracy being 16% lower, multilingual QA being 10% lower, reasoning being 6% lower, with only a tiny win on Amy Math that has 3% higher performance.\n08:27\nHopefully, this gap simply reflects its exclusive focus on coding data, rather than revealing a fundamental flaw in scaling Diffusion LMs.\n08:35\nBut a model that's capable of answering pretty much at an instant, I am so incredibly bullish on that.\n08:41\nThat being said, matching auto-regressive models on reasoning, especially challenging the current test time compute paradigm won't be so easy, as you can't just simply throw more yapping time at them due to its fixed context window.\n08:53\nOn top of that, curating synthetic reasoning data might still need to be bootstrapped from auto-regressive models to close the quality gap.\n09:00\nAlso with things like higher confidence threshold, spamming more denoising iterations, larger model sizes, and some hyperparameter sweeps still have spaces left to be explored.\n09:08\nWith these grounds to cover, Diffusion LM might still need some time to overtake traditional auto-regressive giants if that's even possible, of course.\n09:16\nNot to mention, open source Diffusion LMs actually have quite a lot of optimization problems with the KV catch, so it's not like the one you downloaded now on Hugging Face would generate up to 1,000 tokens per second right away.\n09:27\nBut there is a new research that came out recently which showed that Diffusion LM tends to learn more if data is scarce and compute is not, as the same data set can provide 25 times more learning signals to Diffusion LM than traditional auto-regressive models.\n09:39\nAdditionally, what Diffusion LM also has a pretty good chance of winning at in terms of performance might be the multi-modal department, as Diffusion LM might be a great backbone for an unified model, as it brings a natural advantage when you throw vision into the mix.\n09:53\nFew standout examples come from these two research papers called LaVida and MMaDA, which are both published recently, showing why multi-modal Diffusion LM might be a better choice than multi-modal auto-regressive models.\n10:05\nFor LaVida, which is short for Large Vision Language Diffusion Model with Masking, this paper basically introduced the first family of VLMs based on Diffusion models.\n10:13\nSo instead of processing image features and text left to right, LaVida prepends a fixed vision prefix that are just basically embeddings from a frozen image encoder to the entire masked sequence.\n10:24\nSo every token, including image tokens are being attended by directionally to all other visual and textual context at each iteration.\n10:31\nYou can then do things easily that requires in-filling or early coordination.\n10:36\nFor example, generating a poem where each line starts with a specific syllable or extracting structured information from an image into a predefined JSON format with no extra prompt engineering.\n10:46\nSo for format intensive things like coding, Diffusion LM may just be the way to go, especially with image understanding support.\n10:52\nBut on the topic of integrating image understanding, if you remember my native multi-modal LM video, wouldn't doing it natively, aka early Fusion, still be better than using a frozen image encoder?\n11:03\nCoincidentally, MMaDA, which is also released in the same week as LaVida, proposed exactly this.\n11:09\nIf you remember that early Fusion video, you might remember Chameleon.\n11:12\nAnd MMaDA is just like Chameleon, but instead of being an auto-regressive method, is now generated with a discrete masked diffusion backbone.\n11:20\nAnd when you have an unified architecture, this Diffusion Transformer can literally do anything.\n11:25\nFrom text understanding, vision reasoning, and even text-to-image generation is possible.\n11:29\nTheir open source MMaDA 8B has language capabilities better than LLaMA 3 8B and near the performance of Qwen 2 7B.\n11:36\nIt has better image quality than DALL-E 2 and SDXL and also outperforming auto-regressive base unified models like Chameleon and DeepSeek Janus, while having comparable results with standalone vision encoders that can only do vision understanding.\n11:50\nHow it generally works is that images are quantized into discrete tokens, then mixed with words in the same mask prediction scheme.\n11:56\nDuring fine tuning, it is trained with chain of thought format, teaching the model to plan first and then produce results.\n12:02\nSo this model with no separate decoders, no left to right yapping is able to hold its own ground against existing specialized auto-regressive models.\n12:10\nAnd theoretically, the idea of native multi-modal Diffusion LM just makes so much sense.\n12:15\nOne is that you basically have global context everywhere, so vision and language tokens all see each other at every step with no directional blind spots.\n12:22\nSecond, the multimodal outputs can be unmasked in batches through the denoising process, so long image text sequences would finish faster than auto-regressive pipelines.\n12:32\nThird, the model would have a more consistent structure control.\n12:35\nSo in-filling a table and formatting a JSON just flows naturally from the masked predicting coarse-to-fine generating paradigm.\n12:41\nSo maybe in the next video, I'll talk about the technical side of Diffusion LM, like how it exactly works, the challenges it has with efficiency and how they can be unified while balancing the lost signal from multimodal.\n12:53\nSo subscribe to stay tuned.\n12:55\nAnd if you like today's collection of papers, definitely check out my newsletter where
