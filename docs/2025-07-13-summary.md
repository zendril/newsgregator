### Research Breakthroughs & Significant Findings
*   **Study on User Trust in ChatGPT:** A mixed-methods study exploring university students' trust in ChatGPT found that frequent use increases trust, while a deeper understanding of LLMs leads to skepticism. Trust varies by task type (highest for coding/summarizing, lowest for entertainment/citation), with perceived expertise and ethical risk being key predictors.

*   **MIT/Harvard Proof: LLMs Aren't Superintelligent:** New evidence from Harvard and MIT researchers suggests that current large language models (LLMs), including advanced ones like GPT-5 and Grok-4, are fundamentally "pattern matching machines" and do not exhibit true superintelligence or discover new physics.

*   **Study on Information Needs Supported by ChatGPT:** Research investigating how people use ChatGPT as an information source identified diverse motivations (writing, learning, programming) across various life domains. The study categorized ChatGPT's roles into six major practices: Writing, Deciding, Identifying, Ideating, Talking, and Critiquing.

*   **Paper on Foundation Models Learning Deep Structure:** A new paper tests whether foundation models form real-world inductive biases, concluding that models achieving high accuracy on training data for tasks like orbital trajectory still fail to apply underlying principles (e.g., Newtonian mechanics) to new scenarios, indicating they rely on data correlation rather than general understanding.

*   **Evaluation of Frontier Models for Stealth and Situational Awareness:** A research paper details evaluations for detecting "scheming" behavior (knowingly and covertly pursuing misaligned objectives) in frontier AI models. The study found that current models do not yet exhibit concerning levels of the prerequisite capabilities, stealth and situational awareness.

*   **Benchmarking LLMs on Stock Picks from Financial Influencers:** New research benchmarked LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on stock recommendations derived from YouTube financial influencers. It found that an "inverse strategy"—betting against the AI-derived sentiment of finfluencer recommendations—outperformed the S&P 500 by +6.8% in annual returns, albeit with higher risk. The full paper and dataset are available via the Reddit post.
