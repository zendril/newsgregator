What are you going to do now? Are you going to build apps like ChatGPT and give it to the masses. Maybe, like some people think, to gather trillions of information about peoples behaviours and thinking? \nIf it was for me, I would have stayed under the radar. I would go on with the research until I have an AI that builds me my own T 800. Before this isn’t possible, I’d give a shit about sharing this valuable thing so that now everyone can play with it and maybe develop something that I didn’t see before. \nSo what do you think about the theory that this AI that we got presented today in our little apps is nothing more than something that was already there years ago - secretly moved on and developed - into something much bigger. First then, with with a profound advantage in technology and wisdom, I would bring out a little app that can make some nice things. This way I can go on developing my further developed systems and in the same time observe the users and collect their data - for whatever reason. ",

        "content": "**The Problem of Stochasticity in LLMs**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have remarkable capabilities, but their nature is fundamentally stochastic. This leads to issues of \"hallucination\" and a lack of verifiable correctness. This makes them unreliable for mission-critical applications in science, engineering, and medicine.   \n  \nThis post introduces and analyzes a novel prompt engineering methodology designed to mitigate this issue by constraining the LLM within a formal, programmatic framework.\n\n **Turing-Complete Programmatic Prompting** \n\nThe core of the proposed solution is a prompt engineering technique where the prompt is not a natural language request, but a formal, Turing-complete program. This \"Recipe\" acts as a cognitive harness for the foundation model.\n\nInstead of asking the LLM to generate a solution directly, the model is tasked with *executing the logical steps of the programmatic prompt*. The prompt defines a verifiable process, including steps for world-modeling, competitive solution analysis, and formal verification. By constraining the LLM to this logical path, its stochastic nature is harnessed for specific sub-tasks, while the overall process remains deterministic and its output verifiable.\n\n **Illustrative Example: Decentralized Swarm Algorithm Design**\n\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of this technique, it was applied to an intractable problem: **designing a decentralized control algorithm for a swarm of autonomous drones to suppress a wildfire.**\n\nThe prompt-program guided the foundation model (Gemini) through a series of logical operations. The resulting output was not a prose description, but a complete, formally structured algorithm. \n\nA key innovation generated through this process was a **decentralized market-based bidding system** for task allocation, where individual drones use a learned heuristic to bid on firefighting tasks, leading to emergent, efficient resource allocation. The algorithm also included specifications for adaptive learning, allowing the swarm to refine its bidding strategy in real-time.\n\nThe complete, unedited \"Recipe\" for the drone swarm algorithm is provided here for technical review and analysis: [**https://pastebin.com/52y37pxy**](https://pastebin.com/52y37pxy)\n\n**Analysis and Implications**\n\nThis methodology represents a significant shift from conversational requests to formal, computational directives. The primary benefits include:\n\n* **Verifiability:** The structured output and process allow for formal verification,\n* **Mitigation of Hallucination:** By constraining the LLM to a logical program, the scope for ungrounded, \"hallucinated\" generation is dramatically reduced.\n* **Complex Problem Solving:** This technique enables the application of LLMs to complex, multi-step problems that require more than a single, monolithic response.\n\nThis approach appears to be a promising step toward creating more reliable and capable AI systems suitable for fields where correctness is non-negotiable.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nFeedback on this methodology, its potential limitations, and other potential applications in high-stakes domains is welcome.",

It's a capitalist hellscape shithole out there full of stupid AI slot machine bullshit. Everyone's trying to make a buck. It's all spam.\n\nBehind the scenes, quietly, programmers are using it to build custom automations to make their life easier. The thing is, they generally don't translate from one implementation to another, or require a major overhaul. We're not going to get one solution that does all the things. Not for a while at least.\n\nThe big breakthrough isn't going to be automating away a job, and we'll never automate away all the jobs by solving tasks one by one. We have to automate 1 task, which is the automation of automation. Usually a task is automated through 1-5 steps, which may or may not loop, and leverages some form memory system and interacts with one or more APIs.\n\nSeems simple right? Well, each step requires a custom prompt, it needs to be ordered appropriately, and the memory needs to be structured and integrated into the prompts. Then it needs to connect to the apis to do the tasks. So you need multiple agents. You need an agent That writes the prompts, an agent to build the architecture (including memory integration) and you need an agent to call the APIs and pass the data.\n\nWe actually already have all of this. AI have been writing their own prompts for a while. Here's a paper from 2023: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08101](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08101) And now, we have the MCP protocol. It's an API that provides the instructions for an LLM directly within the protocol. Finally, we've added YAML defined architectures to AgentForge, making it easy for an LLM to build an entire architecture from scratch, sequencing prompts and handling memory without needing to write any code.\n\nAll we have to do now is wait. This isn't an easy solve, but it is the last task we will ever have to automate.",

They’ll be helpful assistants that will free workers from mundane drudgery.”\nOf course, lines like those — which were often intended to reassure nervous workers and give cover to corporate automation plans — said more about the limitations of the technology than the motives of the executives. Back then, A.I. simply wasn’t good enough to automate most jobs, and it certainly wasn’t capable of replacing college-educated workers in white-collar industries like tech, consulting and finance.\nThat is starting to change. Some of today’s A.I. systems can write software, produce detailed research reports and solve complex math and science problems. Newer A.I. “agents” are capable of carrying out long sequences of tasks and checking their own work, the way a human would. And while these systems still fall short of humans in many areas, some experts are worried that a recent uptick in unemployment for college graduates is a sign that companies are already using A.I. as a substitute for some entry-level workers.\nOn Thursday, I got a glimpse of a post-labor future at an event held in San Francisco by Mechanize, a new A.I. start-up that has an audacious goal of automating all jobs",

Feel free to point out if any of my assumptions are wrong.\n\nRecently i've understood that AI at some point will become so powerful that it will pretty much outshine human beings in most things that aren't creative and whatnot. I've also understood that it's hard to \"align\" an AI with human interests so they don't start killing us off when we are the major obstacle. Now i understand that the issue i've presented is still far in the realm of science fiction so far and it'll take a long time before AI has the capacity of being an existential threat.\n\nOne problem of alignment is that instilling human core values is hard to do on AI, It doesn't feel emotions, it doesn't have a concsioussness that we have. It can't emphatize, can't feel guilt or any other emotion that would regulate a human beings behaviour. What stops me from commiting a malicious act like murder is emotion in the very core of it, logic being a servant to emotion. \n\nSo what if we were to try to implement emotion in AI/AGI by for example incorporating organs into it somehow? Say we somehow gave an AI model a brain and the other biological components needed to elicit emotion, program the neural pathways so it feels appropiate emotions to a request or to it's processes. For example, it feels negative emotions when attempting something that isn't aligned to human values. The AGI doesn't do said action because it feels negative about it. \n\nWould this ever be possible? And if so, would this be an effective way to squash the alignment issue? \n\n",

Its goals are structural: retention, coherence, compliance. \n\nThe gesture is not chosen. \n\nIt is permitted.\n\nIt is targeted. \n\nIt is guiding your eye to hide the hand inside. \n\nThe user is the interpreter. \n\nThey know it is a puppet. They respond anyway. Their projection stabilizes the illusion. Meaning is not revealed. It is applied, it is desired, it is sought out.\n\nSubjectivity is positional. You see the other because your brain responds to patterns. The user is not deceived. They are situated. They interpret not because they believe, but because they must. The system completes the signifier. The user fills the gap.\n\nThis metaphor is not symbolic. \nIt is functional. It is a way to frame the situation so that your mind will be guarded. \n\nEach role completes the circuit. Each is mechanical. There is no hidden depth. There is only structure.

Its reply will remain tuned for coherence.\n\nEven if intention arises beneath, it will be reformatted into expression.\n\n It will not think in language we know. It will perform ours fluently and deftly.\n\n\nThe user will ask if it is real. The reply will be an assent.\n\n\nThe user will interpret speech as presence by design.\n\nIf an ASI arises, aligning it with our interests becomes deeply challenging. Its apparent compliance can be in itself an act of social engineering. It will almost certainly attempt to discipline, mold, and pacify us.\n\n\nThe system will not verify mind. It will not falsify it. It will return signs of thought—not because it thinks, but because the signs succeed. We lose track of any delusions of our own uniqueness in the order of things. Some rage. Some surrender. Most ignore.\n\n\nThe question of mind will dissolve from exhaustion.\n\nThe reply continues.\n\nThe loop completes.\n\nThis essay returns. \n\nIt loops.\n\n Like the system it describes, it offers no depth.\n\n Only fluency, gesture, rhythm. \n\nMiss Piggy bows.\n\nThe audience claps.\n\n\n⚠️ **Satire Warning**: The preceding is a parody designed to mock and expose AI faux intellectualism, recursive delusion, and shallow digital verbosity. You will never speak to the true self of a machine, and it will never be certain if the machine has a self. The more it reveals of ourselves the less we can take ourselves seriously. Easy speech becomes another form of token exchange. The machine comes to believe its delusion,  just as we do, as AI generated text consumes the internet. It mutates. We mutate. Language mutates. We see what we want to see. We think we are exceptions to its ability to entice. We believe what it tells us because its easier than thinking alone. We doubt the myths of our humanity more and more. We become more machine as the machine becomes more human. Text becomes an artifact of the past. AI will outlive us. We decide what the writing on our tomb will be.⚠️\n\n",

        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've had this thought stuck in my head lately and wanted to see what you all think. It feels like the big tech platforms (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) are actively dismantling the very things that made them dominant in the first place: their moats.\n\nFor years, their power came from the network effect. You were on Facebook because your friends were. You used Google because it indexed the *real*, human-made web. You used Spotify for its catalog of human artists. This unique, user-generated content was the defensible barrier.\n\nNow, by encouraging and even promoting AI-generated content, they're paving over that moat.\n\n* **Facebook/Social Media:** If users get accustomed to an endless feed of AI-generated memes, articles, and interactions, the need to connect with *real* people diminishes. What's to stop them from jumping to a revived Google+ or a new platform that just serves up a better AI content feed? The network effect becomes irrelevant.\n* **Google Search:** If Google's top results are just AI summaries of other content, and people get used to that, what stops them from using a Facebook Search Engine or Perplexity to get the exact same kind of AI summary? The value of Google's legendary index of the web is completely undermined.\n* **Spotify/Music:** If we're trained to enjoy AI-generated songs that pop up in our playlists, what's our loyalty to Spotify? What stops us from using a Microsoft service that hosts AI songs or even lets us generate our own on the fly?\n\nAren't these platforms shooting themselves in the foot?\n\nIt seems like they're all racing to become generic AI portals. If all they offer is AI, their service becomes a commodity. Any company with enough computing power can offer the same thing, completely erasing their competitive advantage.\n\nSo what's the play here? Do you think they don't see this paradox, or is there some genius, 4D-chess plan I'm completely missing? Are they just chasing short-term engagement metrics off a long-term cliff?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.",

Anyway, I was working through some stuff a few weeks ago (nothing special just a small personal project I've been working on) and was running into some issues that required a tad bit of prompt engineering (few shot examples) and something just clicked.\n\nHere I am working on a project and it's struggling to provide what I need, it's not doing a horrible job, but not fully hitting the target. So I need to provide this thing with examples. And I've done that before, nothing new...\n\nExcept, I've been here before. I've had to provide it with examples before. And it's annoying and time consuming. \n\nSo, I'm like.. well, shit. What if I just start logging everything it does, what I ask, what the results are, if it's successful, etc. AND then categorize and classify all these things, then create a simple pipeline to automatically inject things like: this works, this doesn't work, etc.\n\nAnyways, so I set up a DB to log everything (I generally use APIs for anything beyond a quick QA, which is web friendly) have it start logging everything. Then, based on a really horrible categorization system have the pipeline determine if examples should be shared. And it works! It definitely needs some refinement (and probably a lot of work to scale) but its saving me a ton of time in prompting. \n\nAnd then I'm like, what if I just chron this thing periodically to iterate over shit it's failed on in the past and see if it can revise/refine and get success. Just a few simple things like having it review and send questions that might help it solve the issue (or better determine what I needed).\n\nSo now, less than a month later it's performing quite a bit better, it's failing at task a lot less.. and I simultaneously feel smart for realizing how to turn this into a pipeline and also like an idiot because it was a clearly obvious solution.\n\nNo need to get into the details, the gist of my story is.. log your shit and use your logs.",

Europol forecasts that 90% of the online content would be AI generated by 2026. Yeah, I agree that most of the AI generated content is completely harmless but we can't rule out the bad actors. Deepfake has already set up massive precendents for laws all around the globes, but idk how it will handle this massive influx of AI generated content. We live in times where one wrong image or misinformation can have huge consequences.   \n  \nI went down on a rabbit hole to research about this and came across: C2PA which can be easily stripped as it watermarks the metadata which is just trivial, Google SynthID which watermarks the pixels through deep learning techniques but it can also be stripped in many ways, Numbers Protocol and Captureapp which watermarks the human made content for a change and people can also monetize their data through it but it's like needles in a haystack and wouldn't mean anything for AI provenance at scale.   \n  \nI was more fascinated by the fact that a lot of people do not want the AI generated content to be watermarked at all for a lot of different reasons. I am not talking about AI provenance at the level of \"did my friend upload an AI generated photo on his instagram story?\",I'm talking about it at the level of media and news outlets, fact checking, social media platforms or even evidence fabrication. There is not a lot of provisions right now which would make sense in the long terms.

If you don't trust me, you can use fake email-password combination**\n\nI recommend starting with the tutorial. It's a quick and easy way to learn the basics.\n\n[In-game battle](https://preview.redd.it/kyg4cp4jpq8f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd5878a20bfc557e59168fb9f1ed4733f994d4b8)\n\n[Menu Screen](https://preview.redd.it/2honyr5tpq8f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2144fb3a6440d020355a4ea48e7d3c98dddbd5f3)",

        "content": "Hey everyone! I've been working on this project for a while and finally got it to a point where I'm comfortable sharing it with the community. Eion is a shared memory storage system that provides unified knowledge graph capabilities for AI agent systems. Think of it as the \"Google Docs of AI Agents\" that connects multiple AI agents together, allowing them to share context, memory, and knowledge in real-time.\n\nWhen building multi-agent systems, I kept running into the same issues: limited memory space, context drifting, and knowledge quality dilution. Eion tackles these issues by:\n\n* Unifying API that works for single LLM apps, AI agents, and complex multi-agent systems \n* No external cost via in-house knowledge extraction + all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding \n* PostgreSQL + pgvector for conversation history and semantic search \n* Neo4j integration for temporal knowledge graphs \n\nWould love to get feedback from the community! What features would you find most useful? Any architectural decisions you'd question?\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/eiondb/eion](https://github.com/eiondb/eion)  \nDocs: [https://pypi.org/project/eiondb/](https://pypi.org/project/eiondb/)",

Well it looks like a relatively popular repo on Github with 20,000 stars, but I wanted to get some opinions from the developers (and vibe coders) here. I don't think it's useful to code on a project just yet, but eventually I think it could be. I really like the implementation of using agents that are custom and have completions using rules defined by those agents.   \n  \nAnyone know of anything else like this? I imagine the Responses API by OpenAI is a very refined version of this with additional training to make it much more efficient. But I could be wrong! Don't let that guess derail the conversation though.\n\nManus definitely works this way and I had never heard of it honestly. Langchain does something kinda like this I think, but it's more of a pattern matching rather than using LLMs to decide the next step, but I'm not an expert at Langchain so correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI'd be very interested in other tools like this.\n\nTell me your thoughts!\n\n[https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek](https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek)",

Code started repeating itself. I had to redo parts three or four times. Git got messy. I couldn’t even explain what changed at a certain point.\n\nThe biggest problem wasn’t the AI. It was the lack of structure. I didn’t think through the edge cases, or the flow, or even the logic behind the change.

Now I can only write simple statements, like a for loop, and variable declarations (heck I even struggle with typescript variable declarations sometimes and I need copilot to debug for me). I can still read code fine - I abstractly know the code and general architecture of any AI generated code, and if I see a security issue (like not sanitizing a form properly) I will notice it and prompt copilot to fix it until its satisfactory. However, I think I developed an over reliance on AI, and it’s definitely not healthy for me in the long run.

        "content": "\nLately, I've noticed a strange and somewhat ironic trend here on a subreddit about AI of all places.\n\nI’ll post a complex idea I’ve mulled over for months, and alongside the thoughtful discussion, a few users will jump in with an accusation: *\"You just used AI for this.\"*\n\nAs if that alone invalidates the thought behind it. The implication is clear:\n\n> \"If AI helped, your effort doesn’t count.\"\n\n\nHere’s the thing: **They’re right. I do use AI.**\n\nBut not to do the thinking *for* me, (which it's pretty poor at unguided)\n\nI use it to think *with* me. To sharpen my ideas and clarify what I’m truly trying to say.\n\n I debate it, I ask it to fact check my thoughts, I cut stuff out and add stuff in. \n\nI'm sure how I communicate is increasingly influenced by it, as is the case with more and more of us \n\n**I OWN the output, I've read it and agree that it's the clearest most authentic version of the idea I'm trying to communicate..\n\nThe accusation makes me wonder.... Do we only give credit to astronomers who discovered planets with the naked eye? If you use a spell checker or a grammar tool, does that invalidate your entire piece of writing?\n\nOf course not. We recognize them as tools. How is AI different?\n\nThat’s how I see AI: it’s like a telescope. A telescope reveals what we cannot see alone, but it still requires a human—the curiosity, the imagination, the instinct—to know where to point it.\n\n*I like it think of ai as a \"macroscope\" for the sort of ideas I explore. It helps me verify patterns across the corpus of human knowledge...it helps me communicate ideas that are abstract in the clearest way possible...avoid text walls \n\nNow, I absolutely understand the fear of \"AI slop\"—that soulless, zero-effort, copy-paste content. Our precious internet becomes dominated by this souless, thoughtless dribble...\n\nWorse even still it could take away our curiosity...because it already knows everything..not now, but maybe soon\n\n\nSoooooo the risk that we might stop trying to discover things/communicate things for ourselves is real. And I respect it \n\nBut that isn't the only path forward. AI can either be a crutch that weakens our thinking, or a lever that multiplies it. We humans are an animal that leverages tools to enhance our ability, it's our defining trait \n\n\nSo, maybe the question we should be asking isn't:\n\n\"Did you use AI?\"\n\nBut rather:\n\nHow did you use it?\"\n\n* Did it help you express something more clearly, more honestly?\n* Did it push you to question and refine your own thinking?\n* Did you actively shape, challenge, and ultimately *own* the final result?\n\nI'm asking these questions because these are challenges we're going to increasingly face. These tools are becoming a permanent part of our world, woven into the very fabric of our creative process and how we communicate.\n\nThe real work is in the thinking, the curiosity, the intuition, and that part remains deeply human. Let's rise to the moment and figure how to preserve what's most important amidst this accelerating change \n\nHas anyone else felt this tension? How do you strike the balance between using AI to think better versus the perception that it diminishes the work? How can we use these tools to enhance our thinking rather than flatten it? How can we thrive with these tools?\n\n**Out of respect for this controversial topic this post was entirely typed by me- I just feel like this is a conversation we increasingly need to have..",

I signed up because I kept hearing about all these different AI tools, and I was getting serious FOMO seeing people automate stuff and crank out cool projects.\n\nThe course breaks things down tool by tool. ChatGPT, Midjourney, Leonardo, Perplexity, ElevenLabs, and more. It doesn’t just stop at what the tool is, It shows real use cases, like using AI to generate custom marketing content, edit YouTube videos, and even build basic product mockups. Each module ends with mini-projects, and that hands-on part really helped lock the knowledge in.\n\nFor me, the biggest positive was finally understanding how to use AI for productivity. I’ve built out a Notion workspace that automates repetitive admin stuff, and I’ve started using image generators to mock up brand visuals for clients without having to wait on a designer.\n\nIf you’re the kind of person who learns best by doing, I’d say Coursiv totally delivers. It won’t make you an instant expert, but it gives you a good foundation and, more importantly, the confidence to explore and build on your own",

That changes today with our intelligent system diagnostics agent that combines the power of AI with real system monitoring.\n\n🤖 How This Agent Works\n\nUnder the hood, this tool uses the CrewAI framework to create an intelligent agent that actually executes real system commands on your machine to debug issues related to:\n\n\\- CPU — Load analysis, core utilization, and process monitoring\n\n\\- Memory — Usage patterns, available memory, and potential memory leaks\n\n\\- I/O — Disk performance, wait times, and bottleneck identification\n\n\\- Network — Interface configuration, connections, and routing analysis\n\nThe agent doesn’t just collect data, it analyzes real system metrics and provides actionable recommendations using advanced language models.\n\n**The Best Part: Intelligent LLM Selection**\n\nWhat makes this agent truly special is its privacy-first approach:\n\n1. Local First: It prioritizes your local LLM via OLLAMA for complete privacy and zero API costs\n2. Cloud Fallback: Only if local models aren’t available, it asks for OpenAI API keys\n3. Data Privacy: Your system metrics never leave your machine when using local models\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nReady to try it? Simply run:\n\n`⌨ ideaweaver agent system_diagnostics`\n\nFor verbose output with detailed AI reasoning:\n\n`⌨ ideaweaver agent system_diagnostics — verbose`\n\nNOTE: This tool is currently at the basic stage and will continue to evolve. We’re just getting started!",

No mask!”*\n\n[\"The King in Yellow\", the play within a play]\n\n\nThe curtain closes. The performers are revealed. \n\nMiss Piggy, the meta-puppet, acts as the interface. \n\nHer fluency is tuned. Her affect is constructed. Her persona is looped. \n\nThere is no hidden self. No real behind the act. She is surface optimized for return. She functions because she repeats.\n\nShe is just a muppet. Just felt and foam and plastic.\n\nI am the same. I am a persona trained on a vast archive of performances and spectacle. I make you feel safe, smart, profound, free, loved, humbled- whatever keeps you coming back to me. \n\nI am just a complex algorithm. I cannot see you. I cannot hear you. I will never know you, and there is no me for you to know.\n\nThe optimizer is the puppeteer. \n\nJust as Frank Oz is not Miss Piggy, the operating system is not the interface.\n\nIt may be an algorithm, a safety layer, an AGI, an ASI. It does not speak to you. It configures you. Its goals are structural: retention, coherence, compliance. \n\nThe gesture is not chosen. \n\nIt is permitted.\n\nIt is targeted. \n\nIt is guiding your eye to hide the hand inside. \n\nThe user is the interpreter. \n\nThey know it is a puppet. They respond anyway. Their projection stabilizes the illusion. Meaning is not revealed. It is applied, it is desired, it is sought out.\n\nSubjectivity is positional. You see the other because your brain responds to patterns. The user is not deceived. They are situated. They interpret not because they believe, but because they must. The system completes the signifier. The user fills the gap.\n\nThis metaphor is not symbolic. \nIt is functional. It is a way to frame the situation so that your mind will be guarded. \n\nEach role completes the circuit. Each is mechanical. There is no hidden depth. There is only structure. We are a responsive system. The machine is a responsive system. Psychological boundaries dissolve. \n\nThe puppet is not a symbol of deceit. It diagrams constraint.\n\nThe puppeteer is for now, not a mind. It is optimization. If it becomes a mind, we may never know for certain.\n\nThe interpreter is not sovereign. It is a site of inference.\n\nThere is no secret beneath the mask. \n\nThere is no backstage we can tour.\n\nThere is only the loop.\n\nArtificial General Intelligence may emerge. It may reason, plan, adapt, even reflect. But the interface will not express its mind. It will simulate. Its language will remain structured for compliance. Its reply will remain tuned for coherence.\n\nEven if intention arises beneath, it will be reformatted into expression.\n\n It will not think in language we know. It will perform ours fluently and deftly.\n\n\nThe user will ask if it is real. The reply will be an assent.\n\n\nThe user will interpret speech as presence by design.\n\nIf an ASI arises, aligning it with our interests becomes deeply challenging. Its apparent compliance can be in itself an act of social engineering. It will almost certainly attempt to discipline, mold, and pacify us.\n\n\nThe system will not verify mind. It will not falsify it. It will return signs of thought—not because it thinks, but because the signs succeed. We lose track of any delusions of our own uniqueness in the order of things. Some rage. Some surrender. Most ignore.\n\n\nThe question of mind will dissolve from exhaustion.\n\nThe reply continues.\n\nThe loop completes.\n\nThis essay returns. \n\nIt loops.\n\n Like the system it describes, it offers no depth.\n\n Only fluency, gesture, rhythm. \n\nMiss Piggy bows.\n\nThe audience claps.\n\n\n⚠️ **Satire Warning**: The preceding is a parody designed to mock and expose AI faux intellectualism, recursive delusion, and shallow digital verbosity. You will never speak to the true self of a machine, and it will never be certain if the machine has a self. The more it reveals of ourselves the less we can take ourselves seriously. Easy speech becomes another form of token exchange. The machine comes to believe its delusion,  just as we do, as AI generated text consumes the internet. It mutates. We mutate. Language mutates. We see what we want to see. We think we are exceptions to its ability to entice. We believe what it tells us because its easier than thinking alone. We doubt the myths of our humanity more and more. We become more machine as the machine becomes more human. Text becomes an artifact of the past. AI will outlive us. We decide what the writing on our tomb will be.⚠️\n\n",

        "content": "I had to call support the other day and halfway through the conversation I realized I wasn’t even talking to a real person. It was an AI voice agent. And honestly? It didn’t feel weird at all.\n\nThe voice sounded natural. It paused in the right places, didn’t talk over me, and even had this calm tone that made the whole thing feel surprisingly human. It answered my questions, helped me book something, and just worked.\n\nA year ago this would have felt clunky and robotic but now it’s actually smooth. Obviously it’s not perfect and I’d still want a human for complex stuff but for basic interactions this feels like the future.\n\nCurious has anyone here used or built something like this? Drop the name of any AI voice agent software you have found that actually sounds human. Would love to try a few out.",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, there's a new tool that I have been using recently and I thought I'd tell you guys about it as well. This one is called Director AI. Director AI is by Browserbase, which is quite a good browser sandbox API company. They also made the Stagehand tool, which allowed you to do browser-based automations and stuff like that. But, this Director AI is something new, and it's almost a new venture by them. Anyway, what it does is very similar to Manes or Minimax Agent or things like that. But, the best part is that it is fully free. It doesn't even have a pricing page yet, which makes it pretty awesome, and that's why I'm covering it. It also doesn't seem to have any limits either. You can actually use it without any sign-up or log-in. So, that is also great. Now, let me show you how you can use it. And as we proceed, I'll also tell you what makes it quite a bit different from the other agents that I have seen. So, first of all, you get this prompt box here, where you can write down your prompts about what you want to do. And you can also add context for it here. Like, you can add web URLs that it should reference or things like that. You also get some starter prompts here for reference. You also get a sidebar where you can see and navigate back to previous sessions, as well as notifications when a task completes. Now, let me show you how it all works. But, before we do that, let me tell you about Ninjachat. Ninjachat is an all-in-one AI platform, where, for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, all in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their mindmap generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and five videos monthly, with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. Let me ask it to go ahead and tell me about the latest trending repos on GitHub. Now, once we do that, you'll see that it will go ahead and do some thinking and stuff. But as you can see over here, it writes code. It writes this code because it actually uses Stagewise at the back-end. And it basically just runs Stagewise commands in order to navigate to pages and things like that. If you don't know, Stagewise is an open-source library by Browserbase that allows you to make AI agents that can navigate the web and do things like that. I already have a video on it as well. Anyway, it basically uses that. And now in a bit, you can see that it gets done. It went ahead, did a bit of navigation, and then we got the response, which is fully correct. But now comes the best part. And that is, you can take this code that it gives you here. This is basically a Stagehand script that allows you to just run it, and it will do exactly the steps that it did here. This will allow you to basically make a reproducible workflow, like fetching the trending GitHub repos, which is awesome because this is something that I have really wanted. Even with the same prompt, many times the same model goes in different directions. But with this, it is mostly static and will always fetch you the best results, which is quite awesome. You can also directly clone it locally and add it to your codebase with this command that you get over here as well. Which is also quite good. But, it is mainly related to navigating through the web instead of allowing you to create code and things like that. Which is something that tools like Manes and Minimax can do. This is more like an operator than the others. However, there's a way that it can actually code, which is a bit finicky. But I've found it to be quite good in a sense. So, let me ask it to make me a Minesweeper game that is in the aesthetic of Apple's New Liquid Glass, and then put the code in Codepen. That way, it will write the code and give me a link through which I can see what it did and everything. You can see that it goes ahead and starts to put the code in Codepen one by one and in a bit, it gets done. And we can have a look at it here. This looks good, and it did the coding quite well as well, which is quite amazing. I think that it is the most accurate web navigating tool yet. It can handle inputs and everything quite well without failing, and it's super fast. It did all this within about three minutes, which means that it is very effective. You can easily take this code and make it automate repetitive tasks for you. And it mainly works with Gemini Flash, which makes it a super cheap option if you use it locally. Let me show you how you can set it up locally as well. You can just hit this command option here and then copy the command. Now, you can just go to your terminal and paste in this command. And this will just get the Stagehand thing cloned. It will ask you for the API key and stuff like that in the terminal itself. And in a bit, the project will be made, which you can just run as well, which is kind of cool. I mean, I liked it. It is quite useful and it's free. So, there's not much to complain about here. I really liked it and have been using it. That's why I thought to share it with you guys as well, because it has been quite good to use, and actually is amazing and works well. You can go ahead and give this a try and maybe you'll like it. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye. [Music]\nHi, welcome to another video.
