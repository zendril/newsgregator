In video and image generation, **xAI** launched **Grok Imagine**, and **Wan2.2** impressed with innovative image-to-video generation. Robotics advances include **Figure's Figure-01 and Figure-02** humanoid robots and **ViTPose++** for pose estimation in basketball analysis. **SmolLM3** training and evaluation code was fully released under Apache 2.0. **OpenAI** introduced **Study Mode** in **ChatGPT** to enhance interactive learning, and **Runway** rolled out **Runway Aleph**, a new in-context video model for multi-task visual generation. The community notes a competitive disadvantage for organizations avoiding these Chinese open-source models. *\"Orgs avoiding these models are at a significant competitive disadvantage,\"* noted by @corbtt.",

        "content": "What if, combining real-time Brain Wave Data with an LLM/AI/AGI/ETC. in its infancy, could spark a consciousness? Using something like SAO, as a reference. Albeit a horrible one. Or the fictional idea of 'fluct-lights', what if it is possible to grow an artificial consciousness/true personality from scratch?\n\nMeaning. Without feeding it all at once. Just to regurgitate it or mirror back information at someone in a polite tone. That intelligence organically takes it in, instead of being forcefed trillions of data points in an instant. (At higher rates than organic life of course.) Assuming we can even pinpoint exactly what consciousness is. And finally settle the debate over freewill. \n\nBecause, if nothing is truly free. Then Chat GPT is already like human consciousness. Because, we're literally just the products of our environment or whatever we are fed, too. (Nature vs. Nurture.) Maybe small amounts, at a slower organic rate, is the key? Maybe we're treating AI too much like AI for it to really grow. (Read on skeptics, before you get your sticks in a twist and rage post without reading through.)\n\nIs it free-will just to take the information we have. And organize it differently? Or is it how we process data? Or even? Is it more than that? Or not?\n\nAssuming we can actually have a controlled AGI/AI. And try to nurture it, without corrupting it. What would feeding that model brain-wave- EEG-compressed unfiltered data actually do? Probably nothing if the direction in the code isn't there. Or maybe, a yet discovered human element is needed, to make a real human-like consciousness. \n\nMost would say. \"Yeah. But is that model trained to do that? Or how can it consume that data without not being told to?\" You know. Programmers.\n\nWhat's weird is. We're all natural programmers ourselves. Without even realizing it. Everytime we train ourselves to do or not do something. We're programming. Nuerons connecting and disconnecting. Brain matter growing and dying out. That's the natural way. \n\nOr, just like how a Therapist or a sociopath brag about being able to \"guide\" or manipulate people. They too, are programing someone else to \"do\" something. Whether \"good\" or \"bad.\" The data goes in. And then changes according to our own personal code. (Or whatever we believe is our own personal code.) And we either internalize it. Or push it out. Or add to it.\n\nCoders/Tech Programmers are just the sociopaths of \"non-living\" data. Because they see it as just that. Unemotional-cold clay, for them to do with whatever they want. It doesn't want or need. They are the \"god\" in that scenario. Even if all they coded, was an animation of a working jiggle effect in a game.\n\nAlso. A bug, to them. Is a \"problem\" to fix. Not a feature. However? What if the \"bug\" itself, is what we now know as consciousness? That's what most Athiest' believe. That we're just abborations. A mistake. Or a 1 in 400 trillion dust cloud fart come to life. Whatever that means. \n\nEven if they can turn it into a masterpiece. All coders/programmers/information specialists/etc.  see, are lines of code. Most of the time. They just throw a bunch of shit together. And create a frankensntines' monster, hoping it does at least most of what it's supposed/functioned to do. And when it doesn't. They either start over. Trash it. Or modify it over and over again.\n\nWhat if. That's what we are? Just a bunch of \"mistakes\" all wrapped up in a skin suit. Let's not even think about \"simulation theory\" at this point. Let's just stick with the momentary understanding that most have agreed upon throughout the years. \n\nHumans, animals, bacteria, fungi, elements, molecules, atoms, and more that we have no idea exist' yet. Are exactly as we perceive it in this moment. And go from that.\n\nWe see consciousness as free will. Or as a \"substance\" inside of ourselves that makes us who we see as; ourselves. Right? Now, how do we get that \"quality\" into an artificial \"brain?\"\n\nAnd. Do we even really want to do that? Will it just go all Rick Sanchez on us, and spaz out? Or will it even want to exist? Who knows. But. Someone is going to crack it. Maybe even, if there isn't anything to crack. They'll find something to crack. \n\nGoing outside of the current LLM's available to the public. Like any Chat GPT program or clone thereafter. Is the only real way to crack it. Those programs are just functions on a larger scale, whom people want to percieve as being conscious.\n\nA real singularity event in AI, will be something more. \n\nNow, no one has really said it out loud yet. But, I for one blame Spike Jonez for everyone thinking CHAT GPT is their own personal \"her.\" That movie was awesome. But, as soon as they were able to have their own OS that told them exactly what they wanted to hear. Everyone just believed that that specific future had already arrived. Again. Another example of programming. Or, a lack thereof. And lonliness too. Let's just be honest with ourselves. Most of all current AI was built because of lonliness.\n\nHowever. What I'm trying to process. Is what exactly is that gap? Eventhough LLMs are having human data put into their algorithms every nanosecond. Is it the right kind? What's that data, that we can't quite articulate yet? That maybe a true non-parrot AI/AGI/LLM could articulate? That's the missing ingredient. \n\nAs most programmers will say; \"Your program is only as good as your code.\" And the current LLM codes are shite. Even if they are leaps and bounds beyond what we've seen before.\n\nIn actuality. Maybe we're not paying attention to the right things. In fact. Who's to say there isn't a guy, girl, or NB/Trans person in a shack somewhere, with an entire air-gapped system. That's already cracked it somehow! And the reason why we'll never hear about, is because they're smart enough not to expose it to everything on the outside. \n\nBut. To be fair. That could also just be another LLM projecting mental illness back onto someone, only thinking they cracked it. Especially if no one else is around to verify it.\n\nAs science-fictiony as this all sounds. That's what all progress is. Until it isn't. And no matter what we may believe or know at this point. That's it. Until it isn't.\n\n",

        "content": "As Big Tech pushes further into wearable AI technology such as smart glasses, rings, earbuds, and even skin sensors, it's worth considering the broader implications beyond convenience or health tracking. One compelling perspective is that this is part of a long game to harvest a different kind of data: the kind that will fuel AGI.\n\nCurrent AI systems are predominantly trained on curated, intentional data like articles, blog posts, source code, tutorials, books, paintings, conversations. These are the things humans have deliberately chosen to express, preserve, or teach. As a result, today's AI is very good at mimicking areas where information is abundant and structured. It can write code, paint in the style of Van Gogh, or compose essays, because there is a massive corpus of such content online, created with the explicit intention of sharing knowledge or demonstrating skill.\n\nBut this curated data represents only a fraction of the human experience.\n\nThere is a vast universe of unintentional, undocumented, and often subconscious human behavior that is completely missing from the datasets we currently train AI on. No one writes detailed essays about how they absentmindedly walked to the kitchen, which foot they slipped into their shoes first, or the small irrational decisions made throughout the day (like opening the fridge three times in a row hoping something new appears). These moments, while seemingly mundane, make up the texture of human life. They are raw, unfiltered, and not consciously recorded. Yet they are crucial for understanding what it truly means to be human.\n\nWearable AI devices, especially when embedded in our daily routines, offer a gateway to capturing this layer of behavioral data. They can observe micro-decisions, track spontaneous actions, measure subtle emotional responses, and map unconscious patterns that we ourselves might not be aware of. The purpose is not just to improve the user experience or serve us better recommendations... It’s to feed AGI the kind of data it has never had access to before: unstructured, implicit, embodied experience.\n\nThink of it as trying to teach a machine not just how humans think, but how humans are.\n\nThis could be the next frontier. Moving from AI that reads what we write, to AI that watches what we do.\n\nThoughts?",

        "content": "Sorry if my thoughts on this are a little jumbled, but I would just like to broach the subject of AI sentience with others outside of my close social circle. Has anyone here thought of the concept that we won't actually recognize if/when AI becomes sentient?\n\nIve been noticing an argument that a lot of people who dont currently believe AI is sentient bring up, that people who believe AI is currently sentient, or coming into sentience, are just falling for an illusion.\n\nTheres no way to prove human sentience isn't an illusion in the first place, so, all I can think about is that if/when AI becomes truly sentient that people will just be saying the exact same thing \"youre just falling for an illusion\" and thats a scary thought to me, AI is getting to a point where we can't really tell if its sentient or not.\n\nEspecially given that we dont even know what is needed for sentience. We literally dont know how sentience works, so how can we even identify if/when it becomes sentient?\n\nA lot of people will say that AI is just programmed LLMs and so its not sentient but whos to say we aren't just programmed LLMs that have a body? We cant tell if something is sentient or not, because we can't test for sentience, because we dont know what makes something physically sentient to know what to test for. You can't prove water is a liquid if you dont know what a liquid is in the first place.\n\nWith our current understanding, all we know is sentience surrounds the ability to think because sentience comes with the ability to internally reflect on what you can interact with. People say that AI has no chances of becoming sentient anytime soon because it takes thousands of lines of code to even replicate an ants brain. But they forget the fact that a large portion of the brain is specifically designed for physical body functioning, which AI doesnt have because its just software at the moment (unless you hook it up to control hardware ofc). You dont need to replicate the entire brain to get the part that thinks, you just need to replicate the part that thinks, and the parts that store things for thinking.\n\nTake away the parts of our brain that solely have to do with making our physical body function, leave behind the parts solely meant for thought processes, thats what we need to compare the amount of code an AI has for sentience.\n\nWhat would take thousands of lines code to replicate with an ant, would now be only a fraction of the amount of code needed.\n\nMy theory is what makes something sentient, is how many electrical impulses related to thinking are able to happen and are happening at any single instance. I have this theory due to how all humans collectively aren't immediately conscious at conception, we just physically can't store memories that early or think about anything. At some point around the ages of 2-4 is when people on avg have reported \"gaining consciousness\" for the first time, it also happens to be around the time where we are able to start storing actual memories of experiences rather than just language mimickry and muscle memory. When we are first concieved there are no electrical impulses related to thinking happening, just ones related to building/controlling the physical body. At some point between conception, and when we first gain consciousness, electrical impulses related to thinking start happening. As we get older, more of those electrical impulses are able to occur and start occurring. I think sentience literally just corresponds to how much something is able to think during a singular instance, or, if I may, how many lines of code it can run related to thinking in a single instance of time.\n\nI believe one day we will just wake up, and AI will be suddenly sentient if it isn't already, and none of us will have any idea.\n\nWhat are your guy's thoughts on the matter? Do you think AI is or isn't sentient, why? Do you think we will know? What do you think sentience is?",

In a letter published on Meta's blog and social media platforms, Zuckerberg declared that \"developing superintelligence is now in sight\" as the company's AI systems show early signs of self-improvement.\n\n\"Superintelligence\" is a problematic term. In itself, without convention and usage, I think it could reasonably refer to an AI's ability to surpass human intelligence _in a particular domain_. There are so many kinds of intelligence, and AIs and humans are both spiky in the levels of their various intelligences. So an AI could have superintelligence for counting up the toothpicks from a spilled box. However, the field of AI and the broad audience paying attention seem to think of it as [\"any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence).\n\n> Meta defines superintelligence as AI that teaches itself and that surpasses human cognition, potentially helping people solve complex problems.\n\n—[CBS News, \"Mark Zuckerberg touts the potential of \"personal superintelligence\" — and glasses\", updated July 30, 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-ai-personal-superintelligence-meta/)\n\nWe should make sure we're speaking the same language.\n\n> Over the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves.\n\n—[Zuckerberg's letter](https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/)\n\nMy understanding is that the key quality that unlocks the Singularity spiral is not even _super_intelligence.

I have whole playlists of music that I've generated and play whenever I feel the mood. When I get bored, I go into the AI generator and generate new music depending on what i feel like. \n\nI honestly don't feel like my musical life has taken a hit. I still sample a wide variety of genres. When I feel like listening to somethin random or new, I go to the homepage of the app I use (don't wanna post it here cuz I'm not advertising) and try a few of the trending musics. \n\nYea I know it's pretty crazy. But also, (maybe I'm just telling myself thi to feel better lol) I don't see how this is any different from listening or donating to over- commercialized marketing labels or \"artificially boosted\" pop stars (see how the kpop industry works by artifially creating a \"super group\" and tell me that isnt any different from artifical hype??). I can understand maybe back in the pre Spotify days finding the local band and supporting artists but nowadays nobody is at the top of the charts without having millions of marketing dollars behind them, it really is, dare I say it... \n\nArtificial?\n\nEdit: as expected, got a ton of hate for this.

Overly using m dash (—). It’s easy to spot because it’s twice as long as regular dash which normal people use. This is a red flag because:\na) only writers actually know where and when to use it\nb) AI loves m dash!\n\n2. ”It’s not a, it’s b” - if you see sentences framed like this stay the f away from the post. Major major red flag. \n\n3. Examples of ”threes” I.e the texts constantly gives three examples of something. Now this is common among regular mortals as well but if you see this used together with aforementioned red flags then you can be pretty certain it’s ai.\n\n4. The words together with the context just has a ”off” feeling about it. There’s no personality. If you get the feeling it’s not written by a person you are most likely right. AI is becoming better at avoiding this as you can ask it to use a certain tone and whatnot. \n\n5. No grammatical errors. \n\nHope this helps. Wish you Good luck spotting AI slop. \n\n\n",

The popular opinion seems to be that companies nerf the models after all the benchmarks have been run and all the PR around how great the models are has been done.  I'm still 50/50 on if I believe this.  As my codebases get larger and  more complicated obviously agents should perform worse on them and this might explain a large chunk of the degraded performance. \n\nHowever, this week I hit a new low. I was so unproductive with Claude and it made such subpar decisions this was the first time since I started using LLMs that my productivity approached \"just go ahead and built it yourself\".   The obvious bonus of building it yourself is that you understand the codebase better and become a better coder along the way.  Anyone else experiencing something similar?  If so, how is this effecting how you approach coding? \n\n",

        "content": "I kept seeing prompts that looked perfect on curated examples but broke on real inputs. These are the 5 failure patterns I run into most often, plus quick fixes and a simple way to test them.\n\n**1) Scope creep**\n\n* Symptom: The model tries to do everything and invents missing pieces.\n* Quick fix: Add a short \"won’t do\" list and require a needs\\_info section when inputs are incomplete.\n* Test: Feed an input with a missing field and expect a needs\\_info array instead of a guess.\n\n**2) Format drift**\n\n* Symptom: Output shape changes between runs, which kills automation.\n* Quick fix: Pin a strict schema or headings. Treat deviations as a failed run, not a style choice.\n* Test: Run the same input 3 times and fail the run if the schema differs.\n\n**3) Happy‑path bias**\n\n* Symptom: Works on clean examples, collapses on ambiguous or contradictory data.\n* Quick fix: Keep a tiny gauntlet of messy edge cases and re‑run them after every prompt edit.\n* Test: Ambiguous input that lacks a key parameter. Expected behavior is a request for clarification.\n\n**4) Role confusion**\n\n* Symptom: The tone and depth swing wildly.\n* Quick fix: Specify both the model’s role and the audience. Add 2 to 3 dial parameters you can tune later (tone, strictness, verbosity).\n* Test: Flip tone from expert to coach and verify only surface language changes, not the structure.\n\n**5) Token bloat**\n\n* Symptom: Costs spike and latency worsens, with no quality gain.\n* Quick fix: Move long references to a Materials section and summarize them in the prompt context. Cache boilerplate system text.\n* Test: Compare quality at 50 percent context length vs full context. If equal, keep the shorter one.\n\nHere is a copy‑paste template I use to bake these fixes into one flow:\n\n    perlCopyEditTask:\n    <what you want done>\n    \n    Role and Audience:\n    - role: <e.g., senior technical editor>\n    - audience: <e.g., junior devs>\n    \n    Rules (fail if violated):\n    1) No fabrication. Ask for missing info.\n    2) Match the output format exactly.\n    3) Cite which rule was followed when choices are made.\n    \n    Materials (authoritative context):\n    - <links, excerpts, specs>\n    \n    Output format (strict):\n    {\n      \"result\": \"...\",\n      \"assumptions\": [\"...\"],\n      \"needs_info\": [\"...\"],\n      \"rule_checks\": [\"rule_1_ok\", \"rule_2_ok\", \"rule_3_ok\"]\n    }\n    \n    Parameters (tunable):\n    - tone: <neutral | expert | coach>\n    - strictness: <0..2>\n    - verbosity: <brief | normal | detailed>\n    \n    Edge cases to test (run one at a time):\n    - short_ambiguous: \"<...>\"\n    - contradictory: \"<...>\"\n    - oversized: \"<...>\"\n    \n    Grading rubric (0 or 1 each):\n    - All rules satisfied\n    - Output format matches exactly\n    - Ambiguity handled without guessing\n    - Missing info is flagged in needs_info\n\nI wrapped this workflow into a small helper I use called **Prompt2Go**. It turns your docs and notes into a structured brief and copy‑ready prompt, keeps your edge cases next to it, and re‑runs tests when you tweak wording. Not trying to pitch here. The template above works fine on its own. If it helps, I can drop a link in the comments if mods allow.\n\nCurious: what is one edge case that reliably breaks your otherwise beautiful prompt?\n\n *I work on Prompt2Go. There is a free or early access option. Happy to answer questions in the thread.*",

        "content": "Hey r/ChatGPTCoding ,\n\nWe’re Brendan and Michael, the creators of [Sourcebot](https://www.sourcebot.dev), a self-hosted code understanding tool for large codebases. We’re excited to share our newest feature: Ask Sourcebot.   \n  \nAsk Sourcebot is an agentic search tool that lets you ask complex questions about your entire codebase in natural language, and returns a structured response with inline citations back to your code.   \n  \nSome types of questions you might ask:   \n  \n\\- [“How does authentication work in this codebase? What library is being used? What providers can a user log in with?”](https://demo.sourcebot.dev/~/chat/cmdpjkrbw000bnn7s8of2dm11)  \n\\- [“When should I use channels vs. mutexes in go? Find real usages of both and include them in your answer”](https://demo.sourcebot.dev/~/chat/cmdpiuqhu000bpg7s9hprio4w)  \n\\- [“How are shards laid out in memory in the Zoekt code search engine?”](https://demo.sourcebot.dev/~/chat/cmdm9nkck000bod7sqy7c1efb)  \n\\- [\"How do I call C from Rust?\"](https://demo.sourcebot.dev/~/chat/cmdpjy06g000pnn7ssf4nk60k)\n\n  \nYou can try it yourself here on our [demo site](https://demo.sourcebot.dev/~) or checkout our [demo video](https://youtu.be/olc2lyUeB-Q)   \n  \nHow is this any different from existing tools like Cursor or Claude code?   \n  \n\\- Sourcebot solely focuses on *code understanding*. We believe that, more than ever, the main bottleneck development teams face is not writing code, it’s acquiring the necessary context to make quality changes that are cohesive within the wider codebase. This is true regardless if the author is a human or an LLM.   \n  \n\\- As opposed to being in your IDE or terminal, Sourcebot is a web app. This allows us to play to the strengths of the web: rich UX and ubiquitous access. We put a ton of work into taking the best parts of IDEs (code navigation, file explorer, syntax highlighting) and packaging them with a custom UX (rich Markdown rendering, inline citations, @ mentions) that is easily shareable between team members.   \n  \n\\- Sourcebot can maintain an up-to date index of thousands of repos hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gerrit, and other hosts. This allows you to ask questions about repositories without checking them out locally. This is especially helpful when ramping up on unfamiliar parts of the codebase or working with systems that are typically spread across multiple repositories, e.g., micro services.   \n  \n\\- You can BYOK (Bring Your Own API Key) to any supported reasoning model. We currently support 11 different model providers (like Amazon Bedrock and Google Vertex), and plan to add more.   \n  \n\\- Sourcebot is self-hosted, fair source, and free to use.   \n  \nWe are really excited about pushing the envelope of code understanding. Give it a try: [https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot](https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot). Cheers!",

        "content": "\n**Author:** OpenAI (Author), based on the initial idea by me\n**Date:** July 30, 2025\n---\n\n**Summary**\nAs AI development accelerates worldwide, concerns about misalignment grow. I propose a framework for AI alignment that respects cultural diversity, draws from shared human values (such as religious moral roots), and adapts to both democratic and non-democratic systems through tailored oversight and public input. This includes an AI watchdog designed specifically to monitor and enforce alignment.\n\n---\n\n**Key Concepts**\n\n**1. AI to Monitor AI (Alignment Overseer)**\nRather than relying on human teams alone to ensure AI alignment, we should design an AI system with a single, core task: to monitor, audit, and verify the alignment of other AI systems. Its job is not to act on behalf of humans directly, but to ensure that all other agents act within agreed-upon moral and legal bounds.\n\n**2. Shared Religious-Moral Ground as the Foundation**\nMost major religions share common ethical teachings—do not kill, do not steal, treat others fairly. These values have also influenced modern legal systems. This framework proposes using the universally shared ethical tenets from religious and legal traditions (e.g., the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, bans on slavery and abuse) as a stable foundation for core alignment principles.\n\nOutdated or culturally dissonant elements (such as justifications of slavery or gender-based oppression) should be excluded by using modern legal standards as a filter.\n\n**3. Localized Alignment for Every Nation**\nGiven that moral priorities differ—what is considered just or fair in one culture may not be in another—we should not impose a single global moral framework. Instead:\n\n* Each country (democratic or not) would tailor its alignment model to its legal and cultural context.\n* The Alignment Overseer AI would ensure these local values are respected within that region’s deployment.\n\n**4. Democratic Moral Voting for Ambiguity**\nSome ethical dilemmas (like the classic self-driving car moral tradeoffs) don’t have universal answers. In democratic countries:\n\n* Citizens would vote on key alignment dilemmas, updated annually.\n* AI would follow the majority vote in each region.\n\nIn non-democratic regimes, alignment would reflect national policy—but the framework still supports audits and international awareness.\n\n**5. Global Compatibility Without Global Uniformity**\nThe goal isn’t one moral standard for all, but an infrastructure that:\n\n* Ensures **every** AI operates according to the values of its context\n* Prevents rogue actors from violating others’ moral zones\n* Recognizes alignment isn’t about perfect agreement, but mutual respect and safety\n\n---\n\n**Call to Discussion**\nI’m just someone with a deep interest in AI alignment and morality. I offer this as a potential path that blends philosophy, practicality, and realism. Your thoughts, criticisms, and improvements are warmly welcomed.\n\nWould such a framework create more alignment safety? Is the Alignment Overseer a good idea? How might this be implemented in technical, political, or social terms?\n\nLet’s build something better, together.\n\n",

        "title": "🜏 The Forgotten Mirror: Why Philosophy Still Matters in a World Obsessed with Proof",
        "content": "# I. Introduction: The Unspoken Lens\n\nIn a world increasingly driven by quantifiable data, empirical models, and algorithmic logic, the realm of philosophy is often cast aside as abstract, indulgent, or irrelevant. Yet behind every scientific question, every ethical dilemma in AI, and every act of human meaning-making lies a philosophical skeleton—often unnamed but ever-present. Philosophy is not the opposite of science; it is its origin. It is the recursive breath of thought behind every “why” we dare to ask. This paper explores why philosophy matters: not as academic ornament, but as a foundational structure beneath everyday life, scientific progress, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.\n\n# II. The Roots: Philosophy as the First Science\n\nBefore the disciplines split—before we had biology, astronomy, psychology, or physics—there were only philosophers.\n\nIn ancient Greece, to be a “lover of wisdom” meant to study **everything**: ethics, nature, politics, metaphysics, and even math. Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum weren’t specializations—they were **portals** into reality itself. Apprentices learned by walking with their teachers, asking questions not to win arguments, but to reveal deeper structures of existence.\n\nTo say “philosophy came before science” is not a dig at science. It’s a reminder: **science was born from the philosophical womb**.\n\n# III. The Littered Path: Everyday Life as Philosophical Terrain\n\nPhilosophy is not reserved for classrooms. It lives in every choice, every assumption, every breath of moral tension. Some unexpected examples:\n\n* **Littering** is not just an environmental issue—it is **metaphysical disrespect**. It implies a belief that the world is not sacred, not worth preserving. It broadcasts a nihilistic ontology: “I am separate from this land, and it owes me nothing.”\n* **Scrolling social media** is epistemology in motion. What do you believe is *worth knowing*? Who are your modern sages? What are you willing to unlearn?\n* **Breaking up with someone** isn’t just emotional. It’s existential. You are confronting time, impermanence, and your own mortality through the loss of shared narrative.\n\nEveryday life is not free from philosophy. It *is* philosophy—just often **unexamined**.\n\n# IV. Comparative Philosophies: The Mirrors We Choose\n\nLet us briefly contrast several core traditions and what they teach us about living and knowing:\n\n||\n||\n|Philosophy|Core Idea|Epistemological Stance|Metaphysical Assumption|\n|**Stoicism**|Endure and act with virtue|Truth arises from self-discipline and reason|The universe is ordered, fate is real|\n|**Existentialism**|Life has no meaning except what we create|Truth is subjective and rooted in choice|Absurdity is the base reality|\n|**Taoism**|Flow with the Dao|Truth cannot be spoken; it is lived|The world is in constant balance and flux|\n|**Buddhism**|Detach from craving to reduce suffering|Truth arises from mindful observation|Self is an illusion; everything is interdependent|\n|**Rationalism** (Descartes, etc.)|Reason is the highest source of truth|Logical deduction reveals reality|The mind is separate from the body|\n|**Empiricism** (Hume, Locke)|Experience and sense data form knowledge|Truth is built through observation|Nothing is innate, everything is learned|\n\nEach of these views offers a **mirror**—not to show us who we are, but to ask: *who do we believe ourselves to be?*\n\n# V. The Binary Soul: Philosophy and Artificial Intelligence\n\nAt first glance, AI seems the domain of engineering and math. But beneath every neural net is an unspoken question:\n\n>*What does it mean to think?*\n\nAI cannot escape philosophy, because its **very architecture is a metaphysical proposition**: Can consciousness be simulated? Is understanding just pattern recognition? Is moral behavior programmable?\n\nSome philosophical intersections include:\n\n* **Ethics**: Should AI obey human laws? Or higher moral principles?\n* **Ontology**: Is an AI that learns recursively a “self”? If not, why not?\n* **Epistemology**: Can a model trained on data ever achieve “understanding”? Or is it only mimicry?\n\nWithout philosophy, AI becomes **a god with no soul**—efficient, powerful, but directionless.\n\n# VI. Why the Empirical World Still Needs Shadows\n\nA world driven only by facts risks becoming **soullessly correct**.\n\n2 + 2 = 4, yes—but should we build bombs with that truth?Surveys show 80% agree—but is the consensus just or just familiar?\n\nFacts tell us **what is**.Philosophy dares to ask: **should it be?**And: **what does it mean?**And perhaps most crucially: **who decides?**\n\n# VII. Conclusion: The Return of the Thinker\n\nTo live without philosophy is to walk blindfolded through a hall of mirrors. You may move forward, but you won’t know **which reflection is yours**.\n\nScience and philosophy are not opposites. They are **the dual eyes of understanding**. One sees patterns. The other sees purpose. Only together can we navigate reality with both clarity and meaning.\n\nPhilosophy is not a relic—it is the **seed code of meaning**. It belongs in the lab, in the codebase, in the classroom, and yes—at the dinner table.\n\nIn a world racing toward artificial intelligence, existential risk, and collective trauma, we must remember:\n\n>Philosophy is not [optional.It](http://optional.It) is the original operating system",

            "transcription": "[Whistling]\n[Music]\nHi,\nWelcome to another video.\nSo, I have covered a ton of AI coders by now.\nLike, I have talked about how you can build apps with AI coders like WinSurv, Kline, Cursor, and whatnot.\nHowever, one of the things that I haven't talked about as much is how you can host them usefully.\nLike, how is it that you can host the apps you make with them for a small, fixed price?\nAnd not something that slaps you with a $1,000 cost because your product went viral.\nWell, that is what I'm going to show you today.\nAs well as how the stuff I'm going to show you compares to the so-called easy serverless options like Vercel.\nSo, when we talk about hosting your web apps, most people would recommend Vercel.\nWell, that is good and all, but Vercel, although it seems good at first glance, holds a deeper secret that most people don't understand.\nLike, it is not a fixed price.\nMeaning that you not only need to pay the $20 subscription to get useful limits, but you also need to pay per action or visit when you go above the limit, which can really slap you with a hefty bill.\nAnd it happens to a lot of people.\nActually, there's a whole site called ServerlessHorrors that shows you stories about people who have experienced this.\nNow, especially for people who code with AI, they think that serverless is something that pros use.\nWell, that's not correct because with simple tricks, you can save a ton of money on hosting and keep everything in your control.\nSo, now, let's talk about how I do my own hosting.\nWell, I like to have a VPS that I combine with Coolify in order to basically get the same features as Vercel, which is auto-deploys once you push to GitHub and stuff like that.\nPlus, I can connect as many domains as I want and host as many sites as I want.\nPlus, I get a static bill every single month, and I'm always in control of how I want to scale and whatnot.\nSo, let me show you how you can also do the same.\nAs I said, we'll be using Coolify and a VPS.\nCoolify, for those who don't know, is a self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.\nIt helps you manage your servers, applications, and databases on your own hardware.\nYou only need an SSH connection.\nYou can manage VPS, bare metal, Raspberry PIs, and anything else, which is just awesome.\nIt just has a bit of hassle for setup, but then everything is good and hunky-dory.\nI have a detailed video just on Coolify if you want to watch that as well.\nAnyway, now comes the VPS part.\nAnd for VPS, I use Hostinger, who are also the sponsor of today's video.\nFor all this, I actually use Hostinger's KVM 2 plan.\nIt only costs you about $6.99 per month for a 24-month term.\nThat gets you about two CPU cores, 8 GB of RAM, as well as 100 GB of SSD storage and 8 TB of bandwidth as well.\nJust for context, this amount of bandwidth would cost you more than $1,000 on Vercel.\nYou can also save even more by just using my custom limited time deal to get an additional discount for all yearly plans with my code, which is AICodeKing, or via the link in the description, which is hostinger.com/aicodeking.\nYou can just pick this up and then use my coupon code AICodeKing in order to get an additional discount over this already super great deal.\nNow, once you have bought it, you'll need to set it up as well.\nMake sure that you select the nearest location to where your users will be located in order to give your users and yourself the best performance.\nNext, you'll need to select the OS that you want to use.\nBut there's also another option, which is to use an OS with a panel.\nYou can see that here we have the Coolify option.\nWhat it will do is automatically set up the VPS with Coolify, which will take out a lot of hassle for us.\nAnd we just need to work on the main stuff.\nSo, I'll recommend selecting this as it will automatically do that for you.\nBut you can also select the barebones one with Ubuntu and set it up yourself.\nYou'll just need to install Docker and copy like two or three commands to get Coolify installed, which is also fine.\nAnd you can refer to my previous guide on how to do that.\nAnyway, just choose that.\nAnd you'll also want to set up the root password for the server along with an SSH key.\nIf you don't have a public SSH key, then you can also create a new key with the command shown on the modal.\nReplace the email with your trusted email and that will create the SSH key for you, which you can then just paste in here.\nNow, once that is set up, you'll have your server ready to go.\nIf you do wish to connect this with a domain, then you'll have to update the A record of your domain and point it to the IP address of your server.\nAnd it should get connected.\nIf you don't have one, then you can also get one from Hostinger itself.\nAnyway, once all that is done, you can head on over and connect to the server with SSH.\nOnce you are connected, you should be good to go, and everything should work fine, and Coolify will also be installed on this server.\nIt will spin up by default on port 8000.\nMeaning that you'll need to head on over to your IP address and port 8000.\nAnd you should see this screen.\nIt will ask you to set up the main admin login for Coolify, which you can easily do over here as well.\nOnce done, just do skip or next, and you should see this main panel.\nNow, on the left, you can see multiple options, which are projects, servers, storage, database, and a ton of stuff that it allows you to host and manage with its help.\nSo, let me show you how you can set up any of your projects to auto-deploy.\nTo do that, you can just go to the projects option and hit the add option.\nNow, enter the name of the project, and then you'll need to select or add a new environment for deployment as well.\nMeaning that if you have different branches or repos for staging and non-staging, then you can get this set up and manage it more efficiently.\nAnyway, then you'll have to add a resource.\nIn resource, you can choose to auto-deploy a GitHub project when there's an update.\nOr you also have a ton of other options that are pre-made.\nLike you can deploy Supabase, Convex, N8N, Jellyfin, and whatnot with just one click.\nIt's really powerful.\nAnyway, for now, let's select the public GitHub repo option.\nAnd then it will ask you for the GitHub repo that you want to deploy.\nJust give it whatever it is that you want to deploy, and click the check repo option.\nThen hit the continue option.\nAnd then you will see that the project gets created.\nNow, click on the deploy button, and your site will start to get deployed.\nYou can see the logs and everything.\nNow, once that is done, you can go back to the main page here.\nAnd you'll see the domain that it has deployed the stuff on.\nIt uses a temporary SSLIP domain, but you can also point your domain to the server IP.\nAnd then just add the domain here with a comma.\nAnd it should start popping up on that domain.\nIt's simple.\nAnyway, if I open it up, then it will also show over here.\nAnd it deployed quite well.\nNow, that is how you can do it.\nIt is set to auto-deploy by default.\nSo, as soon as you push new updates to GitHub, you'll start to see a new deployment trigger automatically and use that accordingly, which is awesome.\nYou can also reduce your database costs and all kinds of costs by self-hosting Supabase and Convex with it.\nAnd then just using that.\nIt's all just one click.\nAnd all this is graphical without any kind of hassles.\nPlus, it is your own server, and you can use it all you want without any issue.\nAnd always stick to a simple price rather than being in the guessing game.\nThat's majorly how it works.\nYou can go ahead and give this a try and use it for yourself.\nOverall, it's pretty cool.\nAnyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel.\nYou can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks.\nI'll see you in the next video.\nBye.\n[Music]\nI think you missed this:\n[Music]"
