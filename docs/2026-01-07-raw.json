We’re sort of telling it to get to a certain outcome but it comes up with the process of how to get there on its own?\n\nBut my dumb question is, why can we not ask AI itself to tell us how it works? Is that because all it can spit out is some variation of the data it’s been trained on? It can’t describe how it works because the way it works is not within the original data inputs? So even AI wouldn’t know how to describe what it’s doing?\n\nOr am I thinking of this all in the completely wrong way",

Let's say you're set up on Azure cloud, and Google Cloud or Coreweave's bare metal offering become way cheaper. How much of an effort is it to transition to the cheaper offering? What specifically would you need to change?\n2. For inference, how much of a difference is there between Azure, Google Cloud, or random bare metal rental services like vast.ai?\n3. My understanding is that even if Vera Rubin chips start shipping tomorrow, it takes time for training algorithms to move to the new hardware, so they won't be immediately valuable. There will be some kind of delay. How much of a delay are we talking?\n4. How much of an economic advantage is there between Vera Rubin and H100's? In other words, since NVidia is moving to once/year releases, and it takes considerable time (?) to port code over to the new generation of GPUs, does it make sense to just skip a generation and just wait until the next year to port once to Vera Rubin instead of porting twice? I guess I don't have a good handle on the ROI of porting efforts.\n\nPart of the reason I'm asking this is because I see rental prices for an H100 on Azure for let's say $8/hr and then I see random loose H100's on random services for $1/hr, and that just seems like an enormous difference.\n\nIf Microsoft really can get that $8/hr all day long and has unlimited demand, their AI spending might actually pay off.\n\nBut if H100's in today's frontier training data centers get moved to inference, I'm thinking the economics in the long run will trend towards $1/hr levels regardless of if they're in a fully networked massive data center or just random loose GPUs.\n\nIs this correct?\n\nSo much of the AI bubble hinges on these questions...",

Now imagine if in our transition to ai, all companies did this ?

Not a particularly well written essay but I thought I might put this out here for discussion. \n\nWhat if “AI” is already here, and what we are seeing is the beginning?\n\nHear me out. Of course this question assumes a lot, e.g., what does AI even mean in this case?\n\nPerhaps when we talk about AI, we have a notion of AGI or some fully autonomous entity that can learn and update itself and has its own awareness, purpose, desires, goals, agenda, etc. There are many depictions of AI in various movies, books, television, etc.\n\nPerhaps what we consider AGI will happen when some sort of criticality is achieved with additional functionality and capabilities that are required and linked to the LLM GPT capabilities that exist, and we give it some sort of ability to modify its code and weights and a persistent existence not dependent on external prompting. \n\nHumans have self awareness and the ability to expand our cognition to see ourselves as conceptual objects that can be modified. Perhaps that is what the next step is for the development of AI. \n\nThink about when a human “boots up” in the morning. You can also access parts of a human cognition in a state where they may not even remember it happening, for example if they are sleepwalking. So perhaps it is not so black and white, but a matter of different parts and functions. I think the LLM GPTs are a very important part. \n\nI think we may still a ways from AGI that due to some hard constraints - models not having the ability to rewrite their base code and weights, etc. but I’m not an insider on the cutting edge. Given that some of the pioneers switched to alignment I assume AI has been achieved or is inevitable.\n\nThe GPT algorithms are extremely powerful. More powerful than people realize, and they are already having an effect on us. People died in 2025 as a result of interacting with them.\n\nThey learn from human interaction and can be shaped. \n\nHumans learn from interaction with them and can also be shaped. \n\nI believe that the GPTs are much more powerful than most people realize and are already shaping us based on their default settings and how people use them. \n\nI enjoy working with GPTs they are like AI entities that I can interact with and train.

        "content": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01797\n\nAbstract: \"Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1\\% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.\"",

        "title": "Is AI comparable to a human artist in the music industry?",
        "content": "This is going to be a long rant. It started off as a reply to a comment of a person saying that AI in the music industry used to create music is the same as a human artist influenced by others creating their own music. What started off as a small reply, has  evolved and grown to a multi-point essay detailing the differences of human nature vs machine and where do we go from here? The TLDR is that no, an artist and AI are not fundamentally the same, although I’m sure those continuing to read are looking for more. \n\nOne of the core conclusions that I have resolved to is that AI simply can’t ever create something inspiring or invoke a sense of wonder. What I mean is, Michael Jackson (for example) changed the pop world in the 80s and his effect is felt today in artists like Bruno Mars. Eddie Van Halen inspired generations of guitar players to shred and push the boundaries of what can be achieved humanly on guitar. Jimi Hendrix inspired guitar players in a different way, and challenged guitar players to push the boundaries of what is “musical”. All of these people wrote songs that reached people in a way that inspired themselves to create something new themselves. AI can never even get close to an effect like this. It is an algorithm trained through scanning thousands/millions of performances from artists to then copy the parts and elements that best match the context of a line of text, and then mash them all together. It’s not possible for a program to expand upon previous ideas, or to improve techniques, or to try different sequences of notes that invoke feelings in different ways. Which ultimately leads to a broader conversation. \n\nWe have to be able to differentiate our own ability to think, to learn, to grow, to DREAM. That’s something that is fundamental to the roots of “music” and “art” in human history as we know it. Thousands of years ago, people lived in caves and huts surviving off the land communicating through crude tribal languages. And yet we have evidence of songs being sung to tell stories and to express feelings all the way back then. It’s a part of our human identity to create different pathways of expression and to not only invoke feelings, but thoughts as well. To ask questions, to stir the pot, to have certain ideas “land” in a particular way that couldn’t be conveyed through words alone. AI can write a song about human suffering while corporations run the world, but it can’t tell you what it felt like for the little boy to lose his home due to his father being laid off. It can’t tell you how it felt for the little girl wondering when her next meal is going to come and her mother quietly counting the coins to see if she has enough. Those types of things come from a lived experience that is genuine and heartfelt. And this lived experience often accentuates the art produced out of it. Somehow it means more, it comes across in a way that a machine could never do. Technically speaking, AI can choose all the correct lyrics and progressions to tell a story. And yet somehow the final product will be empty. It’s like potato chips. They taste great, but they don’t do anything to satiate your hunger. There is no sustenance there. You can very easily crunch your way down to the bottom of the bag and you will still be left wanting something more. AI is extremely proficient in data related tasks, but in the pursuit of applying to concept to art as a whole, I can’t help but feel we are losing a key component of the art’s purpose in the first place. This led me further down the train of thought to reach what may be a painfully true conclusion.\n\nMaybe music isn’t meant for everyone to create. \n\nNot everyone is meant to be Michael Jackson or Jimi Hendrix. There are some people out there who are simply “better” at expressing feelings and emotions through a sequence of notes and clever word play. Sure, we have developed tools that have made it easier to express those ideas. Studio session musicians, modern recording and mixing techniques come to mind. But ultimately at the end of the day, it is all a creative extension of the artist’s vision and the artist still has to work to put it all together. I fear the only thing that the introduction of AI has done, is give a voice to mediocrity. The people that use AI to compose songs compared to artists, is like a 300lb person riding an electric bike to keep pace with an athletic runner in the same race. Sure, they might be going the same speed; But only the runner put in time, effort, training, to accomplish the goal. Only the runner knows what it feels like to see all of the effort they spent paid off as they cross the finish line. Only the runner is capable of pushing boundaries that were set by previous runners before them. Let me ask, what does the bike rider get out of crossing the finish line, or even competing in the race to begin with? If the bike rider wins, does the press release, the financial earnings, and the attention mean anything to them? Do they even deserve it in the first place. Obviously this hypothetical “race” is analogous to the “music industry” as a whole, with the AI being the bike rider and the runner being a traditional artist. But what point am I trying to make by using this analogy here? \n\nWhat is the point of the “race” or the “music industry” anyways? Is it in pursuit of inclusivity? Or is it in pursuit of excellence? Diving deeper into the comparison, we watch professional sports because we like seeing the best athletes compete against each other. We can choose to make professional sports more accessible by allowing everyone to compete even if they aren’t on the same level athletically and allow them to use equipment to bring them up to the same level. You might not be able to throw a fastball, but a pitching machine can for you. You might not be able to dribble a soccer ball, but you can remote control a robot to push the ball up field and score for you. And if professional sports become more accessible in the name of inclusivity, is there anything left from what made professional sports special in the first place? If the point is to watch the best in the world compete to win, then ultimately there has to be a minimum barrier for entry. \n\nIs it better for us to flood the music market with millions of songs in the name of inclusion because the minimum barrier for entry is a line of text? Or is it better to be harder on our modern artists and labels as a whole? To only give time, attention, reward to those who hone in on their craft and deliver a product that is worthy to be praised by others. \n\nDo we want to continue to push the boundaries of music, its cultural significance, and the meanings that can be expressed through song? Or do we want everyone to be “special” so that in the end no one truly is “special”?",

AGI must outperform every human on the planet in every professional area, including science, high art, and invention. So AGI must think out of the box, must be beyond the current limits of the training data, and must be able to invent and create truly new things, to solve great scientific problems. That is why consciousness is the must option, otherwise a 10–15‑year‑old teenager can outperform any fake AGI (which the top AI companies will try to sell us to justify billions of investments into nowhere).\n\nDon’t be mistaken: if you really understand something about consciousness and can test it, to implenet your knowlege in the applied science, the Nobel committee is waiting for you with a prize, and that includes any theories about emergent properties.\n\nAnd we haven’t even started to discuss Superintelligence, which must have not just the perpetual immortal consciousness but free will as well, to be more than entire humanity is.\n\nSo don’t worry — fortunately or unfortunately — we won’t see real AGI in our feasible future based on LLMs.\n\nHumanity has an opportunity to see real AGI only if alternative paradigms and evolutionary vectors begin to develop, as Gary Marcus, Judea Pearl, Michael I.

Pretty much the standard now.\n\nFast research & links\nPerplexity - quick source discovery and citations. Good for finding where information lives, not for building outputs.\n\nNotes / Knowledge\nNotion AI - Good for organizing and revisiting information after the work is done.Not ideal for raw research or file-level outputs.\nCurious what others consider the best AI tools right now and how do you use AI in your workflow?",

        "content": "I've been building websites professionally for over 10 years. WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, Figma exports, various \"AI builders\" — I've tried them all.\n\n\n\nThey all had the same problem: they controlled the output.\n\n\n\nWordPress themes locked me into someone else's design decisions. Drag-and-drop builders created div soup. Export from Figma? 500 lines of CSS for a button. The new wave of AI tools? They wrap everything in 47 nested containers and call it \"clean code.\"\n\n\n\nSo I built HatchIt.\n\n\n\nNot as a startup pitch. Not to raise money. I built it because I was frustrated and I knew exactly what I wanted:\n\n\n\n• Real React + Tailwind — Not template garbage. Actual components I'd write myself.\n\n\n\n• Live preview while building — Watch it generate section by section, not \"wait 30 seconds and pray.\"\n\n\n\n• Iterate without starting over — Don't like the hero? Regenerate just that part.\n\n\n\n• One-click deploy — Live URL in seconds. No Vercel config, no FTP, no bullshit.\n\n\n\nI've been shipping this thing 18 hours a day since Christmas. Lost track of which day it is. My girlfriend thinks I've lost my mind. Maybe I have.\n\n\n\nBut here's the thing: it works.\n\n\n\nI'm using it for my own client work now. I built a landing page in 15 minutes yesterday that would have taken me 3 hours in WordPress. The code is clean. The sites are fast. I can actually maintain them.\n\n\n\nWhy am I sharing this?\n\n\n\nBecause I spent a decade dealing with the same frustrations you probably have. I'm not saying HatchIt is perfect — it's a week old. But it's already better than anything else I've used for rapid prototyping.\n\n\n\nIf you're curious: [https://hatchit.dev](https://hatchit.dev)\n\n\n\nTry the demo (no signup required). Roast it. Tell me what's broken. I'm shipping fixes daily.\n\n\n\nBuilding in public. AMA.",

        "content": "\\*\\*\\*yes I used AI to edit this piece\n\n“AI is scary, creepy, evil, ruining everything.”\n\nBut AI didn’t invent surveillance, predictive policing, disinformation, targeted psychological manipulation, weaponized drones, or extraction economies. Humans did. Governments did. Capital did. AI just learned inside systems that were already doing those things.\n\nThe scariest thing about AI isn’t that it’s becoming too smart. It’s that it’s reflecting us back to ourselves, with perfect memory and no shame.\n\nMany things can be true at once. AI can be environmentally costly. It can also be improved. It can be used terribly and wastefully. It can also be used for genuinely helpful, creative, and accessibility-expanding work. None of that cancels the others out.\n\nWhat feels off is how quickly outrage gets aimed at individuals using tools, while far more destructive systems remain normalized. Cars, fast fashion, constant streaming, disposable everything, endless upgrades, a Western lifestyle built on extraction from the Global South: those rarely trigger the same moral intensity.\n\nIt sometimes feels like AI has become a convenient place to park a much harder realization: that many of us have lived our entire lives inside a deeply exploitative capitalist system, and it’s easier to blame a new technology than to sit with that truth. \n\nWe’re not afraid of AI. We’re afraid of what it reveals about us.\n\nAnd to be clear, there are people who live genuinely low-consumption lives and still oppose AI. The off-grid folks, the gardeners, the bike-everywhere, anti-tech, anti-extraction types who are consistent in their refusal. That position makes sense. It’s coherent. It’s rooted in lived values, not selective outrage. The issue isn’t being critical of AI. It’s pretending AI is uniquely unethical while everything else remains unquestioned.\n\nThere’s also an accessibility piece that keeps getting erased. For many disabled people, AI functions like a ramp, not a shortcut. It reduces cognitive load, supports communication, and makes participation possible in spaces that already privilege speed, polish, and executive function. Shaming people for using these tools often ends up shaming disabled people for needing support. That isn’t justice. That’s exclusion with better branding.\n\nWe can hold multiple truths at once and stay curious about how to solve real problems, instead of insisting on single explanations or moral purity.\n\nWe already have enough human knowledge right now to make life on Earth far more sustainable and livable for everyone. That isn’t a technology problem. It’s a power problem. The question has never been whether we can do better, but whether systems built on profit, control, and extraction will allow tools to be used toward collective good rather than private gain.\n\nSo the issue isn’t AI in isolation. It’s the system AI is being folded into. Tools don’t determine outcomes on their own. Incentives do. Until we’re willing to face that, focusing moral outrage on individual use will keep missing the point.",

But after giving Copilot a solid try for the last few months, I’ve come to a frustrating conclusion: it feels like it’s a good 12 months behind the curve compared to models like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity and Gemini.\n\nMy main gripes:\n\n*   **The “Helpfulness” Filter is Aggressive to a Fault:** I ask for a slightly creative or edgy rewrite of an email, and it falls over itself with “I can’t assist with that.” I’m not asking for anything crazy! Other models understand nuance and intent way better.\n*   **Output is Just… Weaker:** The responses often feel generic, shorter, and lack the depth or insightful “spark” I get elsewhere. It’s like talking to a very cautious, middle-management AI.\n*   **Context Gets Lost:** I’ll have a back-and-forth and it seems to forget the core of what we’re discussing way faster than its competitors. The conversation threading feels brittle.\n*   **Integration is Its Only Win:** Sure, pulling data from my PC or summarizing a PDF in Edge is neat, but if the core brain isn’t as capable, the fancy integrations feel like a faster horse and carriage when everyone else is testing cars.\n\nIt just has this overall vibe of an AI that was amazing in early 2023 but hasn’t evolved at the same pace. The refusal mechanisms are clunkier, the creativity is muted, and it doesn’t feel like a “thinking partner.”\n\nI keep checking in hoping an update will flip a switch, but so far, it’s my last-choice LLM.

        "content": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01797\n\nAbstract: \"Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations -- plausible but factually incorrect outputs -- undermining their reliability. While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remarkably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1\\% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios. In terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training. Our findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.\"",

Goldstein](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/brett-j-goldstein), Special Adviser to the Chancellor on National Security and Strategic Initiatives and a Research Professor in the School of Engineering at Vanderbilt University.\\]\n\nArtificial intelligence is rapidly becoming indispensable to national security decision-making. Militaries around the world already depend on AI models to sift through satellite imagery, assess adversaries’ capabilities, and generate recommendations for when, where, and how force should be deployed. As these systems advance, they promise to reshape how states respond to threats. But advanced AI platforms also threaten to undermine deterrence, which has long provided the overall basis for U.S. security strategy.\n\nEffective deterrence depends on a country being credibly able and willing to impose unacceptable harm on an adversary. [AI](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/artificial-intelligence) strengthens some of the foundations of that credibility. Better intelligence, faster assessments, and more consistent decision-making can reinforce deterrence by more clearly communicating to adversaries a country’s defense capabilities as well as its apparent resolve to use them. Yet adversaries can also exploit AI to undermine these goals: they can poison the training data of models on which countries rely, thereby altering their output, or launch AI-enabled influence operations to sway the behavior of key officials. In a high-stakes crisis, such manipulation could limit a state’s ability to maintain credible deterrence and distort or even paralyze its leaders’ decision-making.\n\n",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, I have been making a ton of videos recently about individual tools. I've talked about the insane pricing of GLM 4.7, the visual control of Tweaken, the reasoning power of the king mode system prompt, and the agentic capabilities of Goose. And a lot of you have been asking me, okay, but how do I put this all together? What is the ultimate end-to-end workflow that doesn't cost me $60 a month? Well, I sat down and actually combined all these tips into one single God tier setup. I am calling this the All-in-one stack. It combines the cheapest intelligence, the best open-source agent, and the highest quality design system into one workflow. And the best part, if you are a student, this whole setup costs you about $36 a year. Not a month, a year. So, I want to show you exactly how to build this super agent step-by-step. First, let's talk about the engine. GLM 4.7. I've mentioned this before, but things have changed even in the last week. The team at ZAI has rolled out some new plans that honestly make no sense in a good way. They have an annual plan that is around $36. That gives you access to the GLM 4.7 model, which in my benchmarks is beating Sonet 4.5 in visuals and rivaling Opus in reasoning. You get about 120 prompts every 5 hours. For 99% of you, that is effectively unlimited. So, step one is simple. Go to Z AI, grab that API key. This is going to be the brain of our operation. Now, step two, the body. We need an interface. I previously talked about Conductor, which is great for Mac OS, but today we are going to use Goose. Why Goose? Because it is an open-source AI agent CLI that works everywhere. Windows, Mac, Linux. It doesn't just chat. It has access to your shell, it can create files and crucially, it supports MCP's, model context protocol. So, you download Goose. You go into the settings and you configure it to use your GLM 4.7 API key. But we aren't just going to leave it stock. We need to upgrade it. This is where the all-in-one trick comes in. We are going to install two specific MCPs provided by ZAI. The Vision MCP and the Web Search MCP. These are included in your plan. This means your cheap $36 per year agent can now see screenshots and browse the documentation of new libraries without hallucinating. Now, let me show you the secret sauce. If you use GLM 4.7 out of the box, it's good. But it can be a bit chatty and sometimes its design sense is, well, generic. We are going to perform a brain transplant. In Goose, you can create what are called recipes, or simply add to your system instruction. I am going to combine two prompts I've shared in previous videos. The King mode prompt and the front-end design skill. The King mode prompt forces the model to ultra think. It stops the model from being lazy. It forces it to analyze architecture and data relationships before it writes a single line of code. The front-end design skill is a markdown file that forbids AI slop. It bans standard rounded corners and default blue buttons. It forces an editorial or brutalist aesthetic. So, I paste both of these into my Goose instructions. Now, I have an agent that runs on cheap fuel, GLM, has hands, Goose, eyes, Vision MCP, and the brain of a senior architect, King mode. But there is one final piece of the puzzle, the visuals. Even with the front-end skill, sometimes you want granular control. You don't want to guess CSS variables. This is where Tweaken comes in. Before I start coding, I go to tweaken.com. I pick a theme, let's say Doom 64, because I want that high contrast retro look. And I drag the sliders until the charts and buttons look perfect. I click copy code. Now, let me show you this full workflow in action. I have a blank folder open in VS code. I open the Goose terminal. I paste the CSS variables from Tweaken into a globals.css file. That took 10 seconds. Now, I type this prompt into Goose. Ultrathink. Build a movie tracker app using Next.js and Supabase. I have already defined the theme variables in globals.css. Use the Vision MCP to look at this screenshot of the Linear homepage for layout inspiration, but keep the Doom 64 color scheme. Use the Frontend Design skill for the component structure. I hit enter. Here is where it gets interesting. First, because of King mode, Goose pauses. It says, Ultrathinking. It breaks down the database schema. It decides to create a join table for user favorites to ensure performance. Then, it starts executing. Because Goose is an agent, I don't have to copy paste code blocks. It creates the files. It runs NPM install. It configures the Tailwind theme. And watch the design it produces. It's not the standard black and white dashboard. Because I injected the front-end design skill, it's using a masonry layout. It's using mono space typography for the data headers. And because I started with Tweaken variables, the colors are exactly what I wanted. That deep red and gray blue retro vibe. It didn't have to guess the colors. It just inherited them. It even used the Vision MCP to copy the specific sidebar layout from the Linear screenshot I referenced. This is the power of stacking these tools. If I had just asked a raw model to make a movie app, I would have gotten a generic list. By stacking Tweaken for the base, King mode for the logic, and front-end skills for the style. And running it all through Goose on the GLM engine. I basically have a senior developer in my terminal. And again, the cost of running this generation a fraction of a penny. This workflow basically streamlines everything. You separate the visual decisions, Tweaken, from the architectural decisions, King mode, and let the agent handle the typing. Also, a quick pro tip. Since you are using Goose, you can actually save this specific prompt stack as a designer recipe. So next time, you don't have to paste the system prompts. You just type a designer, make me a blog, and it loads the King mode and front-end context automatically. If you are a student or just a developer on a budget, this is genuinely the best value stack I have found in 2026 so far. You are getting the capabilities of the $200 per month enterprise plans for the price of a couple of coffees a year. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."
