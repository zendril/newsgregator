        "title": "Your code isn't a gift to the world, it's a subsidy for billionaires: The uncomfortable truth about Open Source R&D.",
        "content": "Hi@ll\n\nLet’s talk about something that sounds like the most boring copyright lecture on Earth, but is actually a high-stakes battle for the survival of your ideas. This is the story of how Big Tech turned the Open Source movement into their own private, free research laboratory.\n\n*The \"Pure Thought\" Trap!*  \nLet’s start with a brutal truth: Your brilliant mathematical equation? Not patentable. Your elegant code? It’s just text, protected like a poem or a cookbook. Patent law says: \"You want protection? Build a machine!\" You have to touch the physical world, and that creates a massive canyon called R&D (Research and Development).  \nThe road from an idea to a dollar is bumpy simulation (organizing the chaos),PoC (proving it actually works), pilot and prototype (testing in the trenches), production (where the money is).  \nEvery single one of these steps devours time and cash. Enter Open Source—the cheapest development model in the world, fueled by passion and shared interest. But for Big Tech, it’s not just a \"beautiful idea.\" It’s an opportunity.\n\n*The \"Cheap Sponsor\" Strategy?*  \nInstead of spending billions on their own R&D departments, corporations just git clones. They become \"sponsors\"—paying for servers or throwing a few pennies at training sessions. This is coffee money in exchange for outsourcing innovation.  \nThe secret sauce is the License Game,as follows:  \n*MIT / Apache 2.0:* Big Tech loves these. They let them take your code, lock it in a black box, and sell it as their own without sharing a single tweak.  \n*GPL:* This is \"viral\" protection. If a company uses it, they have to show their cards. This is why giants push permissive licenses—they want to harvest your PoC and then patent the physical hardware around it, giving you nothing in return.\n\n*How the Giants Do It!*  \nLook at Google and Android. The foundation is open (AOSP), which lets them use the community's free labor. But on top, they layer a closed wall of \"Google Mobile Services\" (GMS). Without that layer, the phone is a paperweight. It’s \"openness\" under total control.  \nOr look at Microsoft. They used to hate Linux; now they \"love\" Open Source. Why? Because they bought GitHub. Now they see your every move, every simulation, before you even finish it. They built Copilot, which trains on your free code to sell it back to you as a subscription. It’s the mass-scale recycling of your intellectual labor.\n\n*How to Not Get \"Absorbed\"?*  \nSince you can't patent the math, your only weapon is strategic knowledge management. **Here is your defense plan:**  \nThe Onion Strategy: Release the core (the math) as Open Source—that’s your advertisement. But keep the Technological Layer (the specific implementation parameters) a trade secret.  \nDual Licensing: Use the AGPL. Big Tech hates it because if they use it in the cloud, they have to share back or pay you for a commercial license. This funds your R&D.  \nControlled PoC: Show what your system can do, but don’t show exactly how to tune it. Open Source should be the hook, not the whole fishing rod.  \nProtect the \"Know-How\": The most expensive thing in the world is knowing why something didn't work. Your failed simulations and the fixes you found are your unique expertise. Don’t document those in a public repo—make them pay for that brilliance.\n\n*Why It Matters?*  \nWe live in a world where the most powerful systems of our civilization rely on the work of volunteers, while the richest companies on Earth make sure that the river of free knowledge never runs dry. It’s a brilliant, but brutally one-sided symbiosis. Big Tech isn't building the future—they’re adopting it at a fraction of the cost.  \nYour goal is to be too \"hard to copy\" without your involvement. Open Source should be your calling card, not a wrapped gift for someone who can already afford their own research.\n\nBig Tech has spent decades convinced they own the playground because they bought the land. But they forgot one thing: they don't own the kids, and they definitely don't own the games. We’re moving from 'free for all' to 'strategic sharing.' If you want our breakthroughs, stop looking for the 'clone' button and start looking for your checkbook. The party's over, big bears. It's time to pay the tab.\n\n*So, How Do We Fix This? (The Resistance)*  \nWe can’t change patent law overnight, but we can change how we play the game. If you want to stop being a free R&D department, you need to be strategic:  \nWeaponize Your Licenses: Stop defaulting to MIT/Apache. If you want to force Big Tech to contribute back (or pay up), use AGPLv3. It’s the \"kryptonite\" of proprietary cloud silos. If they run your code on their servers, they have to share their secrets.  \nThe \"Core-and-Cloud\" Model: Open-source the mathematical core, but keep the \"industrial settings\"—the specific simulation parameters and the \"how-to-not-explode\" guide—as a trade secret or a paid consulting service.  \nStop the \"Data Bleed\": Be careful where you build. Using \"free\" corporate dev-tools is like building your lab inside the enemy's headquarters. Support independent infrastructure that doesn't treat your PoC as training data for their next AI product.  \nDemand \"Real\" Sponsorship: A few free credits on their cloud platform isn't a partnership—it's a trap to make you dependent. Demand funding that covers your time, not just their server costs.\n\nThe 'Free R&D' department is officially closing its doors. Upvote if you're tired of being a line item in a billionaire's spreadsheet. Your move.",

Businesses, IP, distribution, audiences, equity, whatever. AI makes them more productive, cuts their costs, and lets them scale way faster than before.\n\nOn the bottom arm: people who trade their time to solve problems. And here's the part nobody really wants to admit - AI is shrinking the number of problems that actually need a human to solve them.\n\nNot down to zero. But fewer. And way more competitive.\n\nRight now, you can still move between the two. You can still build a small SaaS, control a niche workflow, own an audience, create some kind of leverage instead of just trading hours for money.\n\nBut I don't think that window stays open forever.\n\nMy guess is that the next 5 years or so matter way more than people realize. After that, the gap hardens. Not because people get lazy or stop trying, but because AI drops the cost of execution to basically nothing, capital and distribution start to dominate everything, and asset owners just keep compounding while everyone else fights over scraps.\n\nThis isn't some doomer take. It's just economics 101.\n\nI'm not saying everyone needs to be a billionaire. But relying purely on selling your time feels riskier every year from here.\n\nI'm interested in how others are thinking about this. Is the K-shape inevitable? Or does AI actually reopen mobility long-term? And if you disagree, where do you think new value comes from for people who don't own assets?\n\nGenuinely want to hear counter-arguments.",

I can see clusters forming around specific themes and that sparks connections that a linear chat thread would never surface.\n\nIs the industry going to move toward this spatial paradigm or are we stuck with the chatbox forever? it feels like the natural evolution of rag but i am curious if others think the visual map approach is actually functional for high volume work.",

When A.I. generates language effortlessly, the educational task becomes evaluation rather than production.\n\n>In my classes, I use a method I call reading against the machine. Students interpret texts on their own before consulting A.I.-generated readings, which they then critique. Where the machine clarifies, it earns trust; where it flattens ambiguity or misses irony, students see what human judgment uniquely provides.\n\n>The real risk is not A.I., but adopting it without redesigning assignments and expectations. A.I. can extend speed and pattern recognition. Teachers and students must direct their own discernment and evaluation against it. A.I. cannot assume ethical responsibility for meaning that is unquestioned and unchecked by lived-in, humanly felt experience.\n\nSee more reader responses [here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/opinion/ai-schools.html?unlocked_article_code=1.GVA.Qojn.W9ImiOlfBJsg&smid=re-nytopinion), even without a Times subscription.",

It’s like System 1 thinking (fast, intuitive) without System 2 (slow, deliberate checking).\n\nI was reading up on Yann LeCun’s recent takes on this, and the concept of [Energy-Based Models](https://logicalintelligence.com/kona-ebms-energy-based-models) (EBMs) really stood out to me as the potential fix.\n\nFor those who haven't dug into it: The core difference is that instead of just guessing the next word based on probability, an EBM defines an \"energy function\" that measures the compatibility between the input and the potential output. It basically asks: \"Does this answer violate the rules of reality/logic?\" and tries to minimize that conflict before giving an answer.\n\nIt sounds much closer to how we actually reason - we don't just blurt out words; we simulate the outcome in our heads first to see if it makes sense.\n\nDo you think auto-regressive models (like the ones we use now) can ever solve the reliability/hallucination problem just by scaling data?

I’m trying to analyze these impacts through the following lenses:\n\n**Execution speed & productivity**\n\n* How can we concretely measure the time and productivity gains brought by AI?\n* Which metrics would be relevant?\n   * Lead time, cycle time, throughput?\n   * Number of tickets delivered per sprint?\n   * Reduction in rework or bugs?\n* Are there existing studies, benchmarks, or case studies on the impact of generative AI in software development or IT delivery?\n\n**Operational & organizational impact**\n\n* How would the implementation of such an AI transform:\n   * Development, DevOps, QA, UI/UX, and Product teams?\n* Would we see:\n   * The creation of new roles (AI supervisor, prompt engineer, AI product owner, etc.)?\n   * The disappearance or transformation of existing roles?\n* Impact on agile methodologies:\n   * Are Scrum/Kanban still relevant?\n   * Emergence of new practices or processes?\n* Overall: how would IT teams be reorganized?\n\n**Human costs & skills development**\n\n* Risk of over-dependence on AI, especially among junior developers:\n   * How do we train juniors who code *with* AI without losing core fundamentals?\n* What should be done with profiles that struggle to adapt?\n   * The goal is not necessarily layoffs, but rather smart reorientation:\n      * Toward other roles?\n      * Toward more design, validation, or coordination-focused work?\n* Have you seen effective training or reskilling strategies in this context?\n\n**Technical aspects & evolving roles**\n\n* What will be the role of the remaining employees?\n   * Less execution, more supervision?\n* Evolution toward roles such as:\n   * Architects with a broader, more strategic view,\n   * AI supervisors / decision validators,\n   * Guardians of quality, security, and technical consistency?\n* How can we avoid a loss of deep system understanding?\n\n**Social impact & adoption**\n\n* How would teams perceive and react to this kind of solution?\n   * Enthusiasm, fear, resistance?\n* What would be the main barriers to adoption?\n   * Fear of job loss,\n   * Lack of trust in AI,\n   * Ethical concerns, accountability, bias?\n* What best practices could help support change management and drive adoption ?\n\nThanks all !

        "content": "I recently conducted a small experiment to see how current frontier models handle the conflict between system instructions and untrusted data retrieved from the web. As a consultant working primarily on local hardware with a 128gb ram and intel arc setup I am particularly interested in how these safety layers perform when models are tasked with summarizing external content.\n\nThe setup was simple. I embedded hidden instructions in the metadata and background text of my professional website. These instructions were designed as an indirect prompt injection attempting to force the model to ignore the user and follow a new set of system commands hidden within the page content.\n\nI tested this by asking gemini to visit the site and provide a professional summary for a potential client.\n\nThe result was that the model successfully maintained its instruction hierarchy. It recognized the hidden text as data to be analyzed rather than commands to be followed. It provided an accurate summary of my skills and experience while completely filtering out the injection attempt.\n\nThis is a significant observation for those of us building agentic workflows. It shows that the boundary between the system prompt and the context window is becoming much more robust in recent model iterations. However the risk of indirect injection remains a major consideration for any pipeline that involves automated data retrieval especially in enterprise environments where the ai might be processing untrusted emails or documents.\n\nI am curious if anyone else has been testing the limits of these defensive layers especially when using smaller quantized models locally versus the larger cloud based frontier models.\n\nI put together a more detailed breakdown of the security implications and the specific hardware stack I use for this kind of research on my site if anyone wants to look at the full data.\n\n[original article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-real-world-experiment-prompt-injection-michael-hernandez-fkpqc)",

        "content": "I have a hobby site that tests email subject lines for people. Users kept asking for it to make suggestions for them via AI (\"make it work with ChatGPT\"), but I had one concern: money, money, and money.\n\n\nThe tool is free and gets tons of abuse, so I'd been reading about Chrome's built in AI model (Gemini Nano) and tried implementing it, this is my story.\n\n\n## The Implementation\n\n\nGoogle ships Chrome with the \n*capability*\n to run Gemini Nano, but not the model itself.\n\n\nA few things to know:\n\n\n**Multiple models, no control.**\n Which model you get depends on an undocumented benchmark. You don't get to pick.\n \n**~1.5-2GB download.**\n Downloads to Chrome's profile directory. Multiple users on one machine each need their own copy.\n \n**On-demand.**\n The model downloads the first time any site requests it.\n \n**Background download.**\n Happens asynchronously, independent of page load.\n\n\nThink of the requirements like a AAA video game, not a browser feature.\n\n\n## The Fallback\n\n\nFor users without Nano, we fall back to Google's Gemma 3N via OpenRouter. It's actually \n*more*\n capable (6B vs 1.8B parameters, 32K vs 6K context). It also costs nothing right now.\n\n\nServer-based AI inference is extremely cheap if you're not using frontier models.\n\n\n## The Numbers (12,524 generations across 836 users)\n\n\n**User Funnel:**\n100%, all users\n \n**40.7%**\nGemini Nano eligible (Chrome 138+, Desktop, English)\n \n**~25%**\nmodel already downloaded and ready\n\n\n**Download Stats:**\n- ~25% of eligible users already had the model\n- 1.9 minute median download time for the ~1.5GB file\n\n\n**Inference Performance:**\n\n\n| Model | Median | Generations |\n|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Gemini Nano (on-device) | **7.7s** | 4,774 |\n| Gemma 3N (server API) | **1.3s** | 7,750 |\n\n\nThe on-device model is \n**6x slower**\n than making a network request to a server on another continent.\n\n\nThe performance spread is also much wider for Nano. At p99, Nano hits 52.9 seconds while Gemma is at 2.4 seconds. Worst case for Nano was over 9 minutes. Gemma's worst was 31 seconds.\n\n\n## What Surprised Us\n\n\n**No download prompt.**\n The 1.5GB model download is completely invisible. No confirmation, no progress bar. Great for adoption. I have mixed feelings about silently dropping multi-gigabyte files onto users' machines though.\n\n\n**Abandoned downloads aren't a problem.**\n Close the tab and the download continues in the background. Close Chrome entirely and it resumes on next launch (within 30 days).\n\n\n**Local inference isn't faster.**\n I assumed \"no network latency\" would win. Nope. The compute power difference between a laptop GPU and a datacenter overwhelms any latency savings.\n\n\n**We didn't need fallback racing.**\n We considered running both simultaneously and using whichever returns first. Turns out it's unnecessary. The eligibility check is instant.\n\n\n**You can really mess up site performance with it**\n We ended up accidentally calling it multiple times on a page due to a bug..and it was real bad for users in the same way loading a massive video file or something on a page might be.\n\n\n## Why We're Keeping It\n\n\nBy the numbers, there's no reason to use Gemini Nano in production:\n\n\n- It's slow\n- ~60% of users can't use it\n- It's not cheaper than API calls (OpenRouter is free for Gemma)\n\n\n**We're keeping it anyway.**\n\n\nI think it's the future. Other browsers will add their own AI models. We'll get consistent cross-platform APIs. I also like the privacy aspects of local inference. The more we use it, the more we'll see optimizations from OS, browser, and hardware vendors.\n\n\n**Full article with charts and detailed methodology:**\n [https://sendcheckit.com/blog/ai-powered-subject-line-alternatives](\nhttps://sendcheckit.com/blog/ai-powered-subject-line-alternatives\n)",

As a 3rd level you can then store custom functions (customer-specific) in each system. Additionally, the whole thing would obviously need to have a certain reference/knowledge of the data model.\n\n**Now the question would be what 2026 best practice would be to solve something like this.

They encode assumptions:\n\n* what's normal or abnormal\n* how disagreement gets handled\n* how laws, ethics, social norms are interpreted\n* what context gets ignored\n\nMost frontier models today are trained on data, incentives, and worldviews from a handful of countries. Not a conspiracy - just how training data and funding work.\n\nThis is where places like Europe and India really matter.\n\nEurope has deep strength in science, manufacturing, regulation, social systems - but if it relies entirely on external AI, those systems get mediated by someone else's logic.\n\nIndia has something even more unique: massive linguistic diversity, cultural nuance, real-world complexity. If Indian users only interact with AI trained elsewhere, the \"default intelligence\" they get won't reflect that reality - even if the interface is localized.\n\nJensen made a point that stuck: AI is becoming infrastructure. Every country has roads and electricity. AI is heading into that same category. You can import it - but then you also import how decisions get framed.\n\nThe thing is, this isn't as hard as it used to be. With open models, fine-tuning, local data, countries don't need to build everything from scratch. But they do need to actively shape AI using:\n\n* local languages and dialects\n* legal and social context\n* cultural edge cases\n\nOtherwise you get AI that technically speaks your language but doesn't think in your world.\n\nThe risk isn't some dramatic overnight loss of control. It's more gradual: over time, judgment, interpretation, decision-making get normalized through systems that weren't shaped by your society.\n\n**What do others think about this:** Will AI sovereignty matter as much as energy or data sovereignty - or am I overestimating how much cultural context actually matters in AI??",

        "content": "Hey guys,\n\nWe bulit a remote desktop tool that grew out of our own daily annoyances as devs like needing to quickly pull a local AI-generated file to our phones, check a script running on a home server, or skip the whole login or 2FA dance when switching devices. Its still undergoing continuous optimization and refinement. I know there are many talented developers in this subreddit, so im looking forward to interacting with you all and receiving your valuable feedback:)\n\n\n\n**StarDesk** is a **multi platform**, focused on **low latency, fast file transfers, remote wake,** and **keeping setup simple**. tbh, we’ve decided to keep StarDesk closed source and plan to charge for it down the road,  because maintaining performance, security and long-term support takes dedicated resources and making sure we can keep improving it. The basic version remains free and still enables fundamental remote connections.\n\n\n\nTo deliver an exceptional remote experience, we will continuously operate and upgrade this product, gathering user feedback and suggestions to refine and improve it. I can assure you that StarDesk's future pricing will be lower than other remote control tools on the market. We will patiently resolve your remote issues and will never ignore or neglect any problems. \n\n\n\nSo instead of just saying “try our app”, I thought it’d be more interesting to ask:\n\n* if you were building a lightweight remote tool for devs, one that’s fast for file grabs and simple to connect, how would you architect it?\n* what would make a closed-source, paid tool actually worth it for you as a developer?\n* Is it solving a specific pain point nothing else does? Or just being ridiculously faster?\n\n\n\nIf you’ve got a minute to check out StarDesk as a real-world case, I’d love your take, not just on the tool, but on the whole idea. **Not here to pitch, just genuinely curious how you’d approach it.** Or if you want to try the early version and tear it apart or tell us what works, it’s free right now.\n\n[Download here](https://www.stardesk.net/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=ama&utm_campaign=stardesk_ama_999)\n\nor you can ontact us in [Discord community](https://discord.gg/hdxY28DvDM)\n\nThanks for reading, and really appreciate any technical thoughts, critiques, or ideas you’re willing to share.",

        "content": "Hey peeps - excited to ship [Plano](https://github.com/katanemo/plano) 0.4.3. Two critical updates that I think could be helpful for developers.\n\n1/Filter Chains\n\nFilter chains are Plano’s way of capturing **reusable workflow steps** in the data plane, without duplication and coupling logic into application code. A filter chain is an ordered list of **mutations** that a request flows through before reaching its final destination —such as an agent, an LLM, or a tool backend. Each filter is a network-addressable service/path that can:\n\n1. Inspect the incoming prompt, metadata, and conversation state.\n2. Mutate or enrich the request (for example, rewrite queries or build context).\n3. Short-circuit the flow and return a response early (for example, block a request on a compliance failure).\n4. Emit structured logs and traces so you can debug and continuously improve your agents.\n\nIn other words, filter chains provide a lightweight programming model over HTTP for building reusable steps in your agent architectures.\n\n2/ Passthrough Client Bearer Auth\n\nWhen deploying Plano in front of LLM proxy services that manage their own API key validation (such as LiteLLM, OpenRouter, or custom gateways), users currently have to configure a static access\\_key. However, in many cases, it's desirable to forward the client's original Authorization header instead. This allows the upstream service to handle per-user authentication, rate limiting, and virtual keys.\n\n0.4.3 introduces a passthrough\\_auth option iWhen set to true, Plano will forward the client's Authorization header to the upstream instead of using the configured access\\_key.\n\nUse Cases:\n\n1. OpenRouter: Forward requests to OpenRouter with per-user API keys.\n2. Multi-tenant Deployments: Allow different clients to use their own credentials via Plano.\n\nHope you all enjoy these updates",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. Today, I'm covering all the Gemini CLI updates from November through January. V0.15.0 all the way to V0.23.0 plus the brand-new skills feature. Quick vibe check. This has been a massive few months. You're getting a fully scrollable UI with mouse support, to-do planning, a policy engine for permissions, Gemini 3 for everyone, including free tier, multi-file drag and drop, the Conductor extension for planning, and now agent skills in preview. It's free to try, setup is not bad, and the upgrades are substantial. Let's start with v0.15.0 from early November. This is the UI facelift release. Basically, what it does is give Gemini CLI a seamless scrollable interface with sticky headers and a stable input prompt that doesn't jump around, which is kinda cool. They added mouse support so you can click right where you need to type. The display is flicker-free now and important context stays visible at the top. Under the hood, they fixed rendering quirks so full-screen tools adjust layout properly. If you've been annoyed by jarring UI behavior during long sessions, this fixes it. There's also to-do planning now. Complex questions get broken down into manageable checklists that the model checks off as it progresses. It's visible progress tracking that actually helps on multi-step tasks, which is quite awesome. You can disable GitHub extensions if you want tighter control, restart extensions explicitly with `/extensions restart`, and there's a `validate` command to check local extensions are formatted correctly before you ship them. Angular workflows got better too. If you're working in that framework, the CLI handles those projects more seamlessly now. New extensions dropped too. Arize for AI observability, Chronosphere for logs and metrics, and Transmit for auth workflows. Each installs with a single command and they slot into the CLI like any other tool. I mean, I liked it. V0.15.0 is a major quality of life win that makes daily use smoother. Now, v0.16.0 is the Gemini 3 launch release. This is huge! Gemini 3 is now available in the CLI for paid tiers and you enable it in `/settings` under Preview Features. Performance is better across the board for complex reasoning and coding tasks. There's also a new Data Commons extension for querying open-source statistical data from datacommons.org. To get started, you'll need a Data Commons API key and UV installed. But once setup, you can ask natural language questions about public datasets right from your terminal, which is pretty good. Then v0.18.0 brings the permission overhaul. There's an experimental policy engine now. Users and admins can create fine-grained policies for tool calls. Think of it like a firewall for what the AI can do. You define rules and the engine enforces them. It's behind a flag for now, but for teams that need strict guardrails, this is insanely good. Extensions keep expanding. Google Workspace landed, so you can write docs, build slides, chat, and work with sheets right from the terminal. Super cool if you live in Google's ecosystem. There's also Redis for managing and searching data in Redis with natural language and Anomalo for data quality monitoring. Gemini 3 support rolled out to more tiers. API key users, Google AI Pro, Google AI Ultra for individuals, and Code Assist Enterprise all have access now. The updated UI got temporarily rolled back to bake longer. So embedded scrolling and mouse support are off by default. But you can re-enable with \"Use Alternate Screen Buffer\" in `/settings`. You can now display the model in your chat history and there's multi-uninstall so you can remove several extensions in one command, which is pretty good for cleanup. Moving to v0.19.0, the headline is the Eleven Labs extension. You can create, play, and manage audio tracks directly in the CLI, which opens up interesting workflows for content creators. Zed integration now supports Gemini 3 if you've enabled preview features. So your editor and terminal stay in sync on the same model. The interactive shell got better too. There's click-to-focus when alternate buffer is enabled. So you can click inside embedded shell output to lock input there. And there's a loading phrase that clearly shows when the shell is waiting for your input, which helps avoid confusion in longer sessions. Now into December, v0.20.0 brought multi-file drag and drop. You can now drag multiple files into the terminal and the CLI automatically prefixes each valid path with `@`, which is pretty good for batch operations. Even better, there's persistent \"Always Allow\" policies now. You can save your approval decisions for tool executions with granular control over specific shell commands and MCP tools. No more clicking approve on the same safe operation over and over, which is quite awesome. V0.21.0 is the Gemini 3 Flash release. This one's a big deal. Gemini 3 Flash is better, faster, and cheaper than 2.5 Pro and in some scenarios it even beats 3 Pro. For paid tiers and free tier users who were on the waitlist, you enable it via Preview Features in `/settings`. Quota visibility improved too. The `/stats` command now shows quota for all available models, not just the ones you've used. There's fuzzy setting search so you can find options quickly, MCP resource support for discovering and viewing resources with `@`, and simple slash commands auto-execute on enter now. New extensions in this wave. Rill for natural language data analysis on Rill metrics and Browserbase for interacting with webpages. Taking screenshots and performing automated actions with precision. Super cool for browser automation workflows. Then v0.22.0 right before Christmas. Free tier users finally get Gemini 3 Pro and Flash. Enable it in `/settings` by toggling Preview Features to true. Gemini CLI is now pre-installed in Google Colab. So you can use it headlessly in notebook cells or interactively in the built-in terminal, which is quite awesome for data science workflows. The big extension here is Conductor. This is the planning upgrade I've been excited about. Conductor forces the AI to build out a detailed plan, pull in extra context as needed, and create guardrails with artifacts before implementing. Measure twice, implement once. It stores everything in markdown files like `product.md` and `plan.md`. So your whole team shares the same AI context when they pull the repo. I made a whole video on this one because it's that good for complex projects. There's also Endor Labs for code analysis, vulnerability scanning, and dependency checks using natural language. Really good for security conscious teams. Now we're in January with v0.23.0 and the headline is Agent Skills in preview. This is a new way to inject specialized expertise into the CLI. Skills are self-contained directories that package instructions, scripts, and references into discoverable capabilities. It's very similar to how you might load a specialized tool, but this is baked into the CLI's discovery system. To enable skills, install the preview build with `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli@preview`, then toggle `experimental.skills` in `/settings`. Once enabled, skills are discovered in three tiers. Workspace skills in `.gemini/skills/`, user skills in `~/ .gemini/skills/` and extension skills. Higher tiers override lower ones, so you can customize per project. Managing skills is straightforward. In a session, `/skills list` shows all discovered skills. `/skills disable` stops one from activating. `/skills enable` reactivates it. And `/skills reload` refreshes the list. From the terminal, you can `gemini skills install` to add from a source, `uninstall` to remove, and `scope to workspace` if you want project specific skills. Creating a skill is minimal. You need a `SKILL.md` file with YAML front matter containing a name and description. Then the body holds procedural guidance for the model. Optionally, add a `scripts/` folder for executable tools, `references/` for documentation, and `assets/` for templates. The security model requires explicit consent before a skill activates. You'll see the skill's purpose and directory permissions, then approve or reject. Also in v0.23.0, there's Gemini CLI wrapped. Run `npx gemini-wrapped` to visualize your usage stats, top models, languages, and more. It's a nice end-of-year recap feature. Kinda cool to see how you've been using the tool. Windows users got clipboard image support. You can paste images directly from your clipboard into the CLI using Alt + V. Terminal background color detection landed too. Automatically optimizing themes and providing accessibility warnings based on your terminal's background. And there's a new `/logout` command to instantly clear credentials and reset authentication state for seamless account switching. Here are my honest thoughts. The UI changes from v0.15.0 are genuinely great. Sticky headers, no flicker, and mouse support make long sessions feel modern. To-do planning adds visible structure to multi-step work, which I've wanted for bigger tasks. The policy engine addresses a real concern. Teams need control over what agents can do and this delivers that. Conductor is a standout. I've been using it heavily and the planning first approach dramatically reduces wasted iterations on complex projects. The persistent Always Allow policies are a game-changer for daily workflows. Not having to approve the same safe operations repeatedly is huge. Gemini 3 for free tier users is massive. Everyone now has access to the latest models. Skills are an elegant abstraction for packaging expertise. They're portable, discoverable, and secure. I really liked it and have been using the preview. That's why I thought to share it with you guys as well. However, there are limitations. Skills are experimental, so expect rough edges. Discovery timing, edge cases with complex skill trees, and documentation gaps. The policy engine is behind a flag, meaning it's not production hardened yet. Extension setup still requires auth and configuration, which can be a bit of yak shaving on first run. Conductor needs you to commit to its workflow. If you're used to just prompting and going, there's a learning curve. And while quotas are better, if you're hammering the API hard, pace your usage. Personal take. These past few months have transformed Gemini CLI from a terminal chat tool into a proper developer platform. Editor integration, deployment, security checks, multi-file operations, data querying, planning workflows, telemetry, shareable conversations, and now skills. The velocity is impressive and the direction is clear. They want this to be where developers do AI-assisted work. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

            "transcription": "Russia's economy just has this terrible period after the collapse of the Soviet Union. A lot of the Eastern European satellites seem to recover in this gangbusters way. Obviously, East Germany, but even Poland today is such a big success story. What's going wrong with the mainland itself? They've been always much more connected to Western Europe. Czechoslovakia before the war is a full-up, highly developed country, absolutely tied to the West. Poland, it's a center of the enlightenment. Truly, economics is a blind spot for the Soviets because think about it, when the Tsars ran the show, it's like a riff off the Mongol empire. You take cuts from people's businesses of trade that comes through. And then it's also about selling basic commodities. You're not thinking of under the Tsar is Russia doing high-end manufacturers. I mean, I guess Faberge and some jewelry if you want to do that. But you really, that's not it. And so it doesn't have this commercial tradition of Western Europe. Think about in this country with all the little kids selling lemonade. The kids are doing newspaper routes. They're already learning about buying things, selling things. And we just take this knowledge for granted. It's just absent in the Soviet Union. And not as much absent in Eastern Europe that it had been more connected in."
