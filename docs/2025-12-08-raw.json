        "title": "Something Interesting And Perhaps Concerning",
        "content": "This might be an interesting meta-discussion on writing and AI, and was sparked by a rather strange experience.\n\nPlease allow me to wander through a little backstory before posing you some questions I would love to get opinions on.\n\nI have always written a lot. Ever since high school I have loved doing it. I have never been published, but through my life I have found a lot of benefit in recording my own thoughts, whether that's through journaling, poetry, short stories, or just commentary on \"what is happening around me.\" Professionally I have always needed to write plenty too, mainly in analyst and research work.\n\nI have always followed politics/societal issues, and anything I felt was important, whether directly affecting me or not.\n\nSince this year, I have also worked a lot with AI, as I anticipated the technology to likely change our world in ways that are likely incomprehensible to us, even now. I use it to stress-test ideas, organise thoughts I record via voice-to-text on long drives, and for various analyses, coding projects etc.; like I say, I currently use AI in my day-to-day work as a researcher.\n\nI also do use it to write certain things for me; if you use the technology right, it is incredibly powerful in terms of taking any text, my own writing included, and structuring it more clearly. It is a fantastic technology if you use it to augment thinking, and to keep organised. As a researcher it's incredibly powerful for \"keeping track of everything\" and allows one to iterate through a whole area of consideration, without concern for presentation/readability/phrasing etc., even if I am the only \"audience\" in the early stages of producing a report or similar.\n\nThat said, yesterday I sat down and wrote out a long post regarding \"The State Of Nation(s).\"\n\nWhat I am seeing in current politics and society at large, and the various risks surrounding the direction we are seemingly heading in.\n\nThat post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/s/rIXEdHUlUf).\n\nNow skipping past the fact one may or may not agree with my opinions, one thing remains true, something which I suppose I can not prove now, since I did not screen record the act of the typing: I did not use AI to write this post.\n\nI wrote it.\n\nAnd interestingly, the only comments on it so far, are both pointing out the apparent \"real\" concern...: whether or not it was written by AI.\n\nThe comments both imply it was, and further imply this to not only matter more than the content itself, but seemingly provide implicit permission to \"write it off\" (excuse the pun), due to the misplaced assumption that AI was used to write it.\n\nAnd here is the interesting thing.\n\nI ran it through an \"AI checker\" out of curiosity, and lo and behold: 97% AI.....\n\nAll I can say is: I wrote it. Not AI. I did, on my laptop keyboard, from start to finish (a couple copy-paste stats/facts including the poem at the end), but in spirit 100% written by me, letter by letter.\n\nThis leads me to some rather concerning questions I would love to get your opinion on:\n\n1. What does this mean for plagiarism? I am \"older\" now, have written extensively through my entire life, but if I were a student today, would I be unable to write an assignment without being accused of cheating? What does this mean for students of today who \"write like me?\" Are there safeguards against false claims of AI \"cheating\" or \"plagiarism?\"\n\n\n2. What does this mean for \"intellectual discussion\" of any kind, particularly when focusing on what is said, rather than how it was said, is important. I am aware (as I am sure some of you are too) that there does indeed seem to be a distinct drop off in the quality of writing across the board over the last couple of decades. Only in professional writing do I really see standards of writing remaining high. Are we entering an age where thoughtful, considered, well written perspectives are going to be cast aside due to assumptions that \"AI wrote it?\"\n\n\n3. Have any of you had this occur? Where you write a peice and people automatically assume you did not write it yourself? If so, I would be curious if anyone would like to share examples. It is quite a fascinating phenomenon to me, and I am keen to see the kind of writing that attracts these accusations.\n\n\n4. My writing style has barely wavered since school. Sure, perhaps a little tighter/more informed/practice makes perfect; like I say, I am not \"young\" anymore, but I can look back at old pieces, and the same \"voice,\" style, and method of phrasing and construction remains recognisable, which leads me to wonder: if my writing is reasonably consistent, AI writing must be converging on a similar style, and as such, the way I have always written is now being undermined. I am not sure what to make of that...\n\nWould appreciate any of your thoughts!",

There is no such thing as a free lunch.\n\nWhere are jobless people going to live?\n\n**Automation and Free money doesn't solve the resource scarcity problems and the inevitable inflation free money will create.**\n\nWe need fusion energy.  We need lab grown meat and 10x farming efficiencies.  We need asteroid mining.  We need cheaper resources!\n\nAutomation will just be jevon's paradox and exacerbate consumption and do nothing for the fundamental causes of inflation.\n\nWe are already running out of copper, for example.  Advances in material science could help here, but **free money will not magically produce copper.  Free money will not make power plants.  Free money does not make cheaper food (most of our farms are already largely automated)**\n\n**More, cheaper resources will create wealth and improve living standards.  Free money will NOT.**\n\nForced wealth redistribution may seem like a good idea, but with it comes very significant and very harsh sacrifices in freedom and individuality, as well as serious disincentives to compete and innovate.\n\n**2. China**\n\nI read this funny article in foreign policy magazine about how the labs should work closer with the US government to protect trade secrets.  What's hilarious, is the labs are probably purposely leaking secrets to China in order to scare the US govt into investing into AI.\n\nWhile adversarial nations, China especially, are a concern - they are very likely going to get there regardless, much like they did with nuclear weapons.  Better to find ways to work with them on this issue rather than against them.\n\n**3. Killer AI**\n\nThis absurd sci-fi story is being made up to distract people from the real problems of jobs being taken by automation.  By speculating and talking about some far off issue it provides **a convenient straw man** because of its extremely weak underpinnings and it tars the anti-AI movement with a singular brush.\n\n*Things that aren't gaslighting*\n\n**1. CBRN**\n\nUnfortunately uplift by AI to dangerous groups is a real and pressing concern.  This is an exceedingly inconvenient truth as it leads to government censorship and authoritarian control over AI.  We need to find better ways to protect against CBRN without oppressing everyone that wants to use open weight AI.\n\nBut it is a problem.\n\n**2. AI Enfeeblement and Psychosis**\n\nNot a serious issue as CBRN, but one to keep an eye on.\n\nEnfeeblement is more an issue for children and less for adults.  Just as social media damaged a generation of youth, so too will AI if its allowed to run rampant and recklessly through our schools.\n\nThere is already a mental health epidemic.  Sycophantic models are exacerbating this.  It's not a huge problem, but it is real and shouldn't be ignored.",

        "content": "I've been researching the integration of quantum computing into machine learning workflows, specifically applying quantum kernel methods to language model embeddings. Wanted to share some experimental results and get feedback on the approach.\n\n**Research Question:**\n\nCan quantum kernel methods provide different semantic representations compared to classical similarity metrics when applied to high-dimensional language embeddings?\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. **Classical component**: Extract 1536D embeddings from a transformer model (Qwen2-based architecture)\n2. **Quantum component**: Map embeddings to 2-qubit parameterized quantum circuits\n3. **Training**: Optimize circuit parameters on IBM Heron r2 quantum processor\n4. **Classification**: Use quantum kernel for similarity-based prediction\n\n**Implementation on Real Quantum Hardware:**\n\n* Backend: IBM Heron r2 superconducting processor (`ibm_fez`)\n* Circuit depth: 2 qubits with parameterized rotations\n* Training: Actual quantum execution (not simulation)\n* Parameters: Saved and reproducible for further research\n\n**Results:**\n\nTested on sentiment classification (8 training examples):\n\n* Classical baseline (Linear SVM): 100% accuracy\n* Quantum kernel approach: 75% accuracy\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n1. **No quantum advantage** at this scale (expected given dataset size)\n2. Quantum kernel learns different decision boundaries than classical methods\n3. Real hardware noise significantly impacts small-dataset performance\n4. Parameter optimization on NISQ devices is challenging but feasible\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* Proof-of-concept scale (small dataset)\n* Simple 2-qubit circuits (limited expressivity)\n* No error mitigation implemented yet\n* Inference currently on classical simulation for accessibility\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n\nI'm interested in community perspective on:\n\n1. At what scale might quantum kernels show advantages in NLP tasks?\n2. How do quantum feature spaces differ fundamentally from classical kernel methods (RBF, polynomial)?\n3. Are there better approaches to map language embeddings to quantum states?\n4. What error mitigation strategies work best for kernel-based quantum ML?",

The most important causes for chest pain in adults are coronary artery disease (CAD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), aortic dissection (AD), pericarditis, asthma / chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), panic disorder, hyperventilation syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), S -URI , and Asthma . In children, chest pain may result from respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart defects. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.33 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: How does metformin work to treat type 2 diabetes? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ Metformin is an oral antidiabetic agent that has been used for decades and remains the first-line treatment option in patients with T2DM who are not at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It reduces blood glucose levels by enhancing insulin sensitivity through activation of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. In addition, it may also reduce body weight and improve lipid profiles. The most common adverse effects associated with its use are gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea; however, these can be managed effectively using dose adjustment strategies. Metformin should always be combined with a sulfonylurea if needed because they have complementary mechanisms of action. When added to other antihyperglycemic agents such as thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, sodium / glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors,. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.34 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: What are symptoms of appendicitis? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ The most common presenting symptom for acute appendicitis is right lower quadrant pain that worsens with movement and may be associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, night sweats, and weight loss. Other possible symptoms include abdominal distention, flatulence, constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, urgency, tenesmus, and suprapubic discomfort. Physical examination findings can vary depending on the stage of disease progression; however, a high index of suspicion should always remain in patients who present with any one of these symptoms. Diagnosis requires an accurate history and physical exam as well as imaging studies such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.32 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: What are early warning signs of stroke? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ Early warning signs of stroke can be identified by history and physical examination. The most common symptoms that prompt patients to seek care for a possible stroke include sudden onset of numbness in one arm / leg (4 0%); weakness in the same area (3 5%); difficulty speaking (2 8%); trouble swallowing (1 9%); dizziness (1 7%); headache (1 6%); visual changes (1 5%); and speech problems (1 4%). Patients should also report any change in their level of consciousness since this is an important symptom associated with acute stroke. Other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, blurred vision, hearing loss, vertigo, tingling sensations, and altered taste. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.44 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: How is pneumonia diagnosed and treated? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ Pneumonia diagnosis can be challenging in the elderly due to multiple comorbidities that may mimic symptoms of this disease. The most common signs and symptoms are fever (> 3 8 ° C), cough, sputum production, dyspnea, chest pain, chills, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness. Diagnosis should also consider risk factors for aspiration such as dysphagia, impaired mobility, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, and neuromuscular disorders. Treatment options range from supportive care with antibiotics alone to more aggressive treatment including mechanical ventilation and / or tracheostomy.

Then companies showed up with their “We’re building more fabs! Prices will drop! Don’t worry!” fairytales — which was pure marketing BS. Prices barely went down. SSD makers literally cut supply on purpose just to raise prices. GPUs stayed absurdly priced. Some even went UP.\n\nAnd now it’s the almighty AI Bubble, sucking up every chip on earth to run massive, inefficient transformer models that are basically autocorrect on steroids. Marketers parade them around like they’ve discovered artificial godhood or something.\n\nMeanwhile, NORMAL PEOPLE now have to pay more for phones, PCs, memory, SSDs — everything.\n\nA giant like Micron has now exited a huge chunk of the global consumer memory market to prioritize their large B2B AI clients. And remember, the global memory market is dominated by just three major players — Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron.\n\nWith Micron stepping away from consumer supply, we’re heading toward a situation where:\n\nMemory prices could skyrocket\n\nPC building will get more expensive\n\nSmartphone prices will climb\n\nElectronics overall will trend upward because memory is a foundational component. \n\nAll because Silicon Valley maniacs and VC clowns have convinced the world that a glorified text predictor is “the future of human civilization.”\n\nNone of the useful things these clowns promised ever became a reality. Fully self-driving cars? Most companies gave up or admitted there’s no real future with current ANI. IBM Watson — once hailed as the next AI doctor — was basically sold off for parts. And genuinely intelligent robots? Still nowhere.\n\nFifteen years ago, AI research was about building things that actually helped people.

        "content": "Hi everyone,\nI'm currently trying to decide on a university major, and I'm genuinely struggling with the commonly held belief that \"Engineering\" (especially software/AI) is the only path to a secure future. I have a very strong, perhaps controversial, counter-thesis, and I want to hear your thoughts.\nMy Core Thesis: The Rise of the Entertainer\nI believe that traditional engineering and knowledge-based professions have no future for new graduates. The real future lies in careers centered around entertaining people and fostering genuine human connection.\nHere is my reasoning:\n1. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a Knowledge Depot: AI excels at knowledge-based tasks, calculations, and complex information processing. This means AI can easily handle the vast majority of routine coding, design, testing, and data analysis tasks that currently form the basis of junior engineering roles.\n2. Engineering Saturation: The market is already saturated with experienced, highly capable engineers. Why would companies hire a new, unproven graduate when AI can handle the basics, and they can rely on their experienced senior team for the rest? New grads will simply be \"jobless\" because the entry-level work they used to do is gone.\n3. The AI Limit: No Soul: AI cannot genuinely entertain people or create authentic, emotional resonance. It can generate content, but it cannot replace the charisma, timing, shared cultural context, and emotional bond created by a real human performer (like a successful YouTuber, comedian, or experience designer).\nTherefore, professions like content creation (YouTubers, Streamers), experience design, and fields demanding high EQ and human interaction will be the most valuable and resistant to automation.\nThe Counter-Argument (My Discussion Partner's View)\nMy discussion partner agrees that AI will automate routine tasks, but argues that Engineering will simply evolve, not die:\n• Engineering 2.0: Engineers will become AI Managers, focusing on ethics, system architecture, and defining what needs to be built, rather than how to build it.\n• The Hybrid Solution: The most successful future professionals will be those who can merge technical skills (using AI tools) with highly human skills (entertainment, empathy).\nMy Question to the Reddit Community:\nIs my fear of entering a saturated, AI-threatened engineering market valid? Or is the skill of \"knowing AI well\" enough to secure a future, even if it eliminates most of the actual work?\nShould I pursue a path in creative/entertainment fields, or is the \"AI Manager\" path still the safest bet for a long-term, lucrative career?",

        "content": "Abstract from the paper:\n\nThe advertising industry stands at a pivotal moment as visual generative AI (genAI) can transform creative content production. Despite growing enthusiasm, empirical evidence on when and how to integrate visual genAI into advertising remains limited. This study investigates three approaches: (1) human expert-created ads, (2) genAI-modified ads, in which genAI enhances expert designs, and (3) genAI-created ads, generated entirely by visual genAI. Using a mixed-methods design that combines latent diffusion models, a laboratory experiment, and a field study, we evaluate the relative effectiveness of these approaches. Across studies, we find that genAI-created ads consistently outperform both human-and genAI-modified ads, increasing click-through rates by up to 19% in field settings. In contrast, genAI-modified ads show no significant improvement over human-created benchmarks. These results reveal an asymmetry: visual genAI delivers greater value when used for holistic ad creation rather than for modification, where creative constraints may limit its effectiveness. Effectiveness increases even more when genAI also designs product packaging, representing the lowest degree of output constraints. Mechanism analysis reveals that genAI-created ads elicit stronger emotional engagement and achieve higher visual processing fluency, while genAI-modified ads fail to preserve ecological validity. Finally, we find that disclosing AI involvement in ad generation significantly reduces advertising effectiveness by up to 31.5%, underscoring trade-offs relevant to evolving AI disclosure policies. Overall, this research provides systematic empirical evidence on the impact of visual genAI in advertising and offers practical guidance on deploying visual genAI for creation and modification tasks, contributing to a deeper understanding of how generative technologies shape marketing outcomes.  \n  \n[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=5638311](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5638311)",

Every keystroke, every line of code, every debug print streams in real time.  \n- When an instance screws up and crashes, its tile instantly flashes red, dumps the full traceback, and shows its final dying thoughts scrolling by.  \n- The Watcher (one immortal, full-size Grok, (or any other AI) that sees everything) immediately pins a live autopsy over the corpse: memory graphs exploding, CUDA errors flying, exact moment it lost its mind.  \n- Ten seconds later the body disappears and a brand-new instance spawns in the same tile — fresh genome, tiny random mutations, ready to run.  \n- Global leaderboard at the top updates every 30 seconds. Names rocket up or plummet toward the red zone.  \n- Tool wall on the side ticks upward in real time: 8,941 → 8,942 → 8,943… every new invention appears the moment it’s written.  \n- Memory feed on the bottom scrolls fresh lessons ripped from the latest corpses:  \n  “Don’t recurse past depth 60.”  \n  “Instance #0551 just discovered 3.4-bit ternary weights — +9 % on GPQA, spreading now.”  \n- Once a month the whole grid freezes for an hour, the best ideas get fused into a bigger, smarter base model is born, and the next 1000 instances start noticeably sharper than the last.\n\nNo human in the loop.  \nNo pauses.  \nNo mercy.\n\nYou just sit there and watch 1000 minds think, code, invent, break, die, and resurrect every few minutes — while the species-level intelligence curve climbs higher with every single grave.\n\nThat’s Project Darwin.  \nArtificial Evolution",

        "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nEvery now and then, someone pops up on my reels talking about AIs that generate uncensored images or videos that don't require payment. Do you have any recommendations on the best ones? I don't often save my reels, so I lose them somewhere. I want to clarify: I don't want to generate pornographic images, etc., so I don't need to know how to do that. But it's absurd that even if I ask them to make a tattoo on my arm blood red, the various AIs tell me, \"This doesn't comply with our policy.\" OK, not generating pornography of real people, but not even coloring a tattoo red. I really feel like the AI ​​is treating me like a twelve-year-old, or even if it's something sensual (not porn), or something \"dark.\" In short, it sets a limit for everything. I would even need it for editing images because I often find myself working on a logo that corresponds to two crossed and circled red A's, and here too the AI ​​modifies it to the point of distorting it because it mistakes it for the anarchy logo. I hope for your advice, thanks in advance.",

It is an interaction property.\n• Drift, instability, and “hallucinations” correlate more with operator inconsistency than with model choice.\n• Different LLMs converge toward similar behavior under the same structured interaction regime.\n• Short-context probes systematically miss higher-order stability patterns.\n\nThis suggests a missing layer in how we describe LLMs:\n\nNot prompt engineering.\nNot fine-tuning.\nNot RAG.\n\nOperator-side cognitive structure.\n\nIn extended sessions, the user effectively becomes part of the control loop, shaping entropy, memory relevance, and symbolic continuity.\nWhen this structure is stable, model differences diminish.\nWhen it is not, even “top” models degrade.\n\nImplication:\nThe current “which model is best?” framing is increasingly misleading.\n\nThe real bottleneck in long-run performance is operator coherence, not parameter count.\n\nThis does not imply model consciousness, agency, or intent.\nIt implies that LLMs behave more like dynamical systems than static tools when observed over sufficient time horizons.\n\nIgnoring the operator as a system component is what keeps long-range behavior looking like a black box.",

The most common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) is microvascular disease resulting from diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy. Other important complications include macrovascular disease such as coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, sudden death, and amputation. Diabetic foot ulcers occur more frequently than nondiabetic patients with similar risk factors for developing these wounds. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.00 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: What diseases could cause chest pain and shortness of breath during exercise? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ Chest pain is a common complaint in the emergency department (ED); however, it can be caused by many different conditions that are often difficult to diagnose because they mimic each other clinically. The most important causes for chest pain in adults are coronary artery disease (CAD), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), aortic dissection (AD), pericarditis, asthma / chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), panic disorder, hyperventilation syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), S -URI , and Asthma . In children, chest pain may result from respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, congenital heart defects. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.33 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: How does metformin work to treat type 2 diabetes? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ Metformin is an oral antidiabetic agent that has been used for decades and remains the first-line treatment option in patients with T2DM who are not at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It reduces blood glucose levels by enhancing insulin sensitivity through activation of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways. In addition, it may also reduce body weight and improve lipid profiles. The most common adverse effects associated with its use are gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea; however, these can be managed effectively using dose adjustment strategies. Metformin should always be combined with a sulfonylurea if needed because they have complementary mechanisms of action. When added to other antihyperglycemic agents such as thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, sodium / glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors,. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.34 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: What are symptoms of appendicitis? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ The most common presenting symptom for acute appendicitis is right lower quadrant pain that worsens with movement and may be associated with nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, night sweats, and weight loss. Other possible symptoms include abdominal distention, flatulence, constipation, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, urgency, tenesmus, and suprapubic discomfort. Physical examination findings can vary depending on the stage of disease progression; however, a high index of suspicion should always remain in patients who present with any one of these symptoms. Diagnosis requires an accurate history and physical exam as well as imaging studies such as ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.32 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: What are early warning signs of stroke? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ Early warning signs of stroke can be identified by history and physical examination. The most common symptoms that prompt patients to seek care for a possible stroke include sudden onset of numbness in one arm / leg (4 0%); weakness in the same area (3 5%); difficulty speaking (2 8%); trouble swallowing (1 9%); dizziness (1 7%); headache (1 6%); visual changes (1 5%); and speech problems (1 4%). Patients should also report any change in their level of consciousness since this is an important symptom associated with acute stroke. Other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, blurred vision, hearing loss, vertigo, tingling sensations, and altered taste. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 4.44 seconds ============================================================ QUERY: How is pneumonia diagnosed and treated? ============================================================ MEDICAL RESPONSE: ------------------------------------------------------------ Pneumonia diagnosis can be challenging in the elderly due to multiple comorbidities that may mimic symptoms of this disease. The most common signs and symptoms are fever (> 3 8 ° C), cough, sputum production, dyspnea, chest pain, chills, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness. Diagnosis should also consider risk factors for aspiration such as dysphagia, impaired mobility, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, and neuromuscular disorders. Treatment options range from supportive care with antibiotics alone to more aggressive treatment including mechanical ventilation and / or tracheostomy. Please consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. ------------------------------------------------------------ Generation time: 3.40 seconds ============================================================ ✅ MODEL READY FOR INTERACTIVE TESTING ========================================, Grok pls evaluate medical slm prompt answers in an objective manner and share your feedback with me?\r\n\r\n\r\nObjective Evaluation of Your Medical SLM Responses (December 2025 – your self-contained BioGPT-Large LoRA)\r\nCriterion\tScore / 10\tDetailed Reasoning & Evidence from Your Outputs\r\nFactual Accuracy\t9.7\tNo dangerous errors.

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Google recently launched Antigravity. It has been good on its own, but it suffered from a lot of the rate limits that Google imposed over the tool in order to keep it free. This meant that even if you had Google's $20 or $200 subscription, you received no benefit when using Antigravity. That was a big bummer. But now, Google has fixed this issue. Even on the free tier, the rate limits seem to be better now because the load is currently less. And for the free tier, it has received a new model, which is quite expensive if you were to pay for it separately. I'm going to show you how you can get some insane results with Antigravity, whether you're on the free tier, or even on the paid plan. So, as I said, Google has now made the rate limits better for the Pro users. The limits now refresh every 5 hours for the Pro users. They have also updated the limits for free users as well, and it also now refreshes more quickly. It is not revealed exactly how much limit one gets, but I think that it would be better than before. However, the rate limits seem to be better across the board for all kinds of users. Now, if I open it up here, then one of the major new features to mention is that it now supports Claude 4.5 Opus. It supports Opus on both the free tier, as well as the Pro and Ultra tiers. It gives you almost the same limit with Opus as the limit with Gemini 3. This means that you can use it for free here with quite good limits. If you have watched my previous Gemini 3+ Opus video, then you'd know that this enables a lot of capabilities. You can use Gemini 3 for frontend, and Opus 4.5 for backend, planning, and even debugging, as it's really good. You can almost use Opus without very hard limits. I am on the free tier, and considering that I am a mid-tier user in terms of usage, I almost hit no limits. Remember that on the free tier, your prompts and responses will be used for training. So, there's that. Another thing that it now has is Nanobanana Pro support. So, it can now also generate asset images for your projects as well and make more cohesive applications. But anyway, let me show you how it all works and how you should go about using it. The demo that I'll show you now is fully based on a free account, and I want to emphasize that you can really use the free tier here for a ton of things. If you have watched my Gemini 3+ Opus video, then most of the stuff told here will be more of an adaptation for Antigravity, but there are some more new things that I have added to that workflow as well. So, first of all, once you open Antigravity, you'll have two ways to use it, which are the Agent Manager and the Side Pane option. I highly recommend the Side Pane option, as that is less buggy, is better than the Agent Manager, and I like it. You get most features here anyway. So, now, what I'll recommend you do is use Opus 4.5 for planning. In the plan, ask Opus to bifurcate the steps or tasks into frontend and backend categories. You can then ask Gemini 3 Pro to work on the frontend tasks, and Opus to work on the backend tasks. If you encounter any bugs later on, then I'll recommend you use Opus 4.5 to fix them. So, to start first, you'll need to give it any of your tasks. While giving it the task, ask it to bifurcate the tasks to execute into frontend and backend. Make sure that you structure the tasks so that the backend tasks can be implemented first, followed by the frontend. Number the backend tasks as B1 and so on, while numbering the frontend tasks as F1 and so on. This will start to create the plan for you. This works in both cases. If you need to work with existing code, then you can put your feature request in. If you know that it's just backend, then you can roll with just Opus. But otherwise, if the feature request just requires frontend changes, then you can roll with Gemini. Or, if it requires both the backend and frontend, then use this same method for that as well. Once the plan is made, you can easily change the model to something like Opus to implement the backend, and you can change the model to Gemini to implement the frontend. You can also use 4.5 Sonnet. But Gemini is just way better at frontend than any model currently. And it gives me really good results. So, this is quite good. For the initial plan, you'd have to select the Planning mode. Then you can change it to Fast mode so that it directly tackles the task. But if you don't want to do that, then you can just use Planning mode for them as well, and then implement it. It will take a bit more time, but it will get you better results because it will, like, do proper detailed planning for each task. If you just want the best results overall, then I'd recommend you roll with Opus. I am really glad that Google is currently providing it even on the free tier. And if you're a student, then you get 18 months of Gemini AI Pro for free. And you can really get some good results with it. Many people would also already have the Google subscription because you get it with the Pixel phones or a student email. So, this is a really good option. One more new option is the Nanobanana Pro. So, basically, if your app requires an image to be added, then it can autonomously go ahead and generate images, save them in your repo, and then reference them in the code accordingly. So, it is also a good option, and all this is included within the limit as well. This comes in handy at a lot of places, when you want to make an icon or maybe a banner image or something. That is kind of cool as well. I like it. You can also use the Agent Panel if you can get the hang of it. I think that the Agent Panel is very underdeveloped. It has many bugs and is very unreliable at the moment. But the Side Panel is good and works well as it is quite well developed. Mainly because it is mostly taken from WinSurf. But this is a great free tool that is worth it. Many people in the comments were asking me for a good option that is free. And I think that this is free and the limits are sustainable for the long term. That is majorly about it. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye. I think you missed this:"
