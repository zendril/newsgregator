The result? Fragility. Confusion. Vulnerabilities. The web we know works for us, but it’s alien terrain for machines.  \n  \nIf agents are the next generation of “users,” we need to rethink what the web is — not just a visual layer for humans, but a structured ecosystem that’s legible to both humans and machines.

        "content": "Art, song and writing artificial intelligence models can make really cool stuff. And they are getting better and better by the minute.\n\nBut, Mr. McNugget, that's not the point. The true beauty in creating is in the learning, practicing, agonizing, creating... the process, the marriage of mind, body skill, imagination and hard work.\n\nDo you get it... yet. It's not the output that makes life special. It's the getting there. The amazing days and nights of saying, \"wow, I (not ai) drew that, I sang that, I wrote that, I played that guitar.\"\n\nThe agonizing days of, \"I just can't get it right.\"\n\nAnd the everyday of, \"I guess I'll try again.\"\n\nFive years from now, when you realize there are LITERALLY seventeen kabombbillion songs imagined, written, melodicized, played and generated by ai, all good quality, but not a single one where humans sang, wrote, played-- Will you stop and go, \"Ohhh, Duhhh! We just killed one of the things that makes life beautiful, challenging, interesting.\"\n\nI used music ai for a few months to see what it's all about. To be honest, even though I'm very much against it's use, it is truly amazing what the ai can generate. Did you read that, \"what the AI, AI, AI can generate.\"\n\nDon't kid yourself, children growing up with Ai will not be learning how to write creatively, paint, draw, sing, play an instrument. Why the fuck would they when they can type a few words into next years (and the even better model the year after that), and get amazing results, and be rewarded with led zeppelin's stairway to heaven level quality every time?\n\nYou may want to laugh at me for this, or want to just brush it off as hyperbole, but as someone who worked with thousands of kids, whose background is in psychology and development, Ai will destroy the joy in life, the core of what makes life bearable, the struggle, the loses, the wins, the creation from/through blood, sweat and tears.\n\nI really hope we figure this out, soon, because, from what I'm seeing online, digitally, movies, books, art, songs... we are on a quick road to meaninglessville. There is no meaning in things that take virtually no effort or skill and can be generated by the billions in a matter of days.\n\nThere are thousands of people out there already, people making things like music channels with hundreds, thousands of songs generated by Ai in a few months or a year. \n\nChannels with truly clever (that's sarcasm) \"about\" pages telling a simpletons fictional story about some long forgotten singer/songwriter and their lost music. Some of the songs are actually decent. Many with tens of thousands of listens.\n\nBut not an ounce of skill, blood, sweat and tears or creativity went into the Ai, the Ai, the Ai... generating the songs. (unless of course you consider the millions of artists who ACTUALLY did learn to write creatively, play an instrument, sing... you know... the ones whom the AI, Ai, Ai models used to train on).\n\nIt's both hard to stomach having to try and explain this to people, but also easy to understand. So many people are willing to stroke their own willy like ego to crescendo, lie to themselves and others, and build a world where they are INDEED Mozart. Yet, asked to stand on stage and play a kazoo, they simply can't.\n\nFricking sad. And, no, the answer is NO, as someone who created his own melodies through a cappella singing of my own original lyrics, and made a few songs with those recordings uploaded to an ai model... NO, I don't care if you played, wrote, sang, whatevered the song. If you let Ai in on the creative process, you're de-facto stating, \"It doesn't matter if we humans let ai create the entire song from a few words of input.\" Because, who are you to complain if you used ai yourself, even only a little bit.\n\nAnd, as I said, this is coming from someone who worked with music ai for a few months. Someone who has been deleting all my ai assisted songs over the last few weeks. Some of them had thousands of listens.\n\nI uploaded a lot of my own creative process into the ai songs I generated. Exclusively my words, my singing, my melodies. I wasn't just typing a few prompts and pretending to be an ai composer producer.\n\nThey were still Ai generated. And if I kid myself into thinking that's okay, then who am I to say the person generating thousands of songs using ai writing, ai playing, ai generated from start to finish is a problem?\n\n",

        "content": "Today (October 27, 2025) in the federal *OpenAI ChatGPT Copyright Infringement Litigation* case in the Southern District of New York that consolidates fourteen AI copyright cases, Judge Stein in an eighteen-page memorandum refused to dismiss the case at the defendant’s request. In doing so, he made a ruling from which we might read some tea leaves.\n\nOther current federal AI copyright cases such as *Thomson Reuters*, *Kadrey*, and *Bartz* have been dealing with various aspects of copyright law as applied to AI, with some emphasis on the fair use doctrine. One significant discussed aspect is “input-side” infringement, where the focus is on the copying of the plaintiffs’ works, versus “output-side\" infringement, where the focus is on the AI output and how it compares with the plaintiffs’ original work.\n\nIn today’s ruling Judge Stein held that the plaintiffs subject to the motion had adequately pled their copyright infringement case. As part of that, Judge Stein ruled that the plaintiffs have adequately pled “an output-based infringement claim.” He reasoned that if the facts in the plaintiffs’ pleadings are later found to be true, a jury could find certain allegedly infringing ChatGPT outputs to be substantially similar to the plaintiffs’ original works, using as an example two ChatGPT outputs summarizing or pertaining to plaintiff George R.R. Martin’s novel *A Game of Thrones*.\n\nThe ruling explicitly disclaims that it is dealing in any way with fair use.\n\nJudge Stein’s ruling can be found here:\n\n[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354.617.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354.617.0.pdf)\n\nA list of all the AI court cases and rulings can be found here on Reddit:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/s/B0V5Ny2p0j](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/s/B0V5Ny2p0j)",

        "content": "Hey everyone :D\n\nI thought it’d be really interesting to compare how Apple's new A19 Pro (and in turn, the M5) with its fancy **new \"neural accelerators\" in each GPU core** compare to other GPUs!\n\nI ran Gemma 3n 4B on each of these devices, outputting \\~the same 100-word story (at a temp of 0). I used the most optimal inference framework for each to give each their best shot.\n\nHere're the results!\n\n|GPU|Device|Inference Set-Up|Tokens / Sec|Time to First Token|Perf / GPU Core|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|A19 Pro|6 GPU cores; iPhone 17 Pro Max|MLX? (“Local Chat” app)|23.5 tok/s|0.4 s 👀|3.92|\n|M4|10 GPU cores, iPad Pro 13”|MLX? (“Local Chat” app)|33.4 tok/s|1.1 s|3.34|\n|RTX 3080|10 GB VRAM; paired with a Ryzen 5 7600 + 32 GB DDR5|CUDA 12 llama.cpp (LM Studio)|59.1 tok/s|0.02 s|\\-|\n|M4 Pro|16 GPU cores, MacBook Pro 14”, 48 GB unified memory|MLX (LM Studio)|60.5 tok/s 👑|0.31 s|3.69|\n\n# Super Interesting Notes:\n\n**1. The neural accelerators didn't make much of a difference. Here's why!**\n\n* First off, they do indeed significantly accelerate compute! [Taras Zakharko found that](https://tzakharko.github.io/apple-neural-accelerators-benchmark/#:~:text=Metal%20Shading%20Language.-,Key%20Takeaways%3A,-Operation) Matrix FP16 and Matrix INT8 are already accelerated by 4x and 7x respectively!!!\n* BUT, when the LLM spits out tokens, we're limited by memory bandwidth, NOT compute. This is especially true with Apple's iGPUs using the comparatively low-memory-bandwith system RAM as VRAM.\n* Still, there is one stage of inference that is compute-bound: prompt pre-processing! That's why we see the A19 Pro has \\~3x faster Time to First Token vs the M4.\n\n[Max Weinbach's testing](https://www.macstories.net/linked/max-weinbach-on-the-m5s-neural-accelerators/) also corroborates what I found. And it's also worth noting that MLX hasn't been updated (yet) to take full advantage of the new neural accelerators!\n\n**2. My M4 Pro as fast as my RTX 3080!!! It's crazy - 350 w vs 35 w**\n\nWhen you use an MLX model + MLX on Apple Silicon, you get some really remarkable performance. Note that the 3080 also had \\~its best shot with CUDA optimized llama cpp!",

This mirrors the first-day approach that actually lands with teens.\n3. **Trust but verify habit.** Make a rule: anything important from AI needs a second source (textbook/site/teacher). This is exactly where the teacher’s reality gap exercise - spotting real vs. generated faces - helps build skepticism without fear.\n4. **Privacy first.** Teach kids that prompts can become training data; don’t paste personal info, IDs, or school docs.\n5. **Align with real frameworks.** [UNESCO's](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/what-you-need-know-about-unescos-new-ai-competency-frameworks-students-and-teachers?utm_source=chatgpt.commap)  2024–25 AI competency frameworks what students should learn (safety, ethics, data, creativity).\n6. **Do a monthly misinformation drill.** Watch one deepfake/news clip together; ask: who posted it, what evidence, can we find primary sources? The teacher’s deepfake lesson shows how concrete examples beat lectures.\n7. **Screen time ≠ skill time.** Build a family media plan and weigh sleep, school, and social life over raw hours. Make AI time purposeful (create > consume).\n8. **Whitelist tools + homework etiquette.** List allowed tools for brainstorming/tutoring and the exact disclosure line kids will add to assignments. Pair with school policy if possible.\n9. **Keep it warm and ongoing.** Teens will use AI anyway; the goal is to keep the door open. Research shows adoption at home is already widespread, so make space for questions and constant check-ins.",

It’s like AI is becoming the source of our “intelligence,” and our ability to reason independently is taking a backseat.\n\nI get that AI is powerful and can process info way faster than we can, but doesn’t that make it even more concerning? If we’re always deferring to it, what happens to critical thinking, creativity, or even just the messy, human way we used to figure stuff out? Plus, AI’s only as good as the data it’s trained on, and we all know that can be biased or incomplete. Yet, we’re letting it guide our decisions, from what to buy to how to vote.\n\nI’m not saying AI is evil or anything, but I’m starting to wonder if we’re sleepwalking into a world where human intelligence is just a reflection of what AI tells us it should be. What do you all think? Are we too dependent on AI? Is it actually changing what it means to be “intelligent”? ",

The reason I think Google win is because they’ve always been an A.I company, just not in the LLM way. They most likely adopted this due to competition. When you zoom out. You realize that they’re one of the only companies that has the history of company culture, the infrastructure, the money, the revenue, basically every single box you can tick, they tick. They also have quantum breakthroughs happening, alongside a.i breakthroughs, they have the respect and reputation, and trust, and most importantly the data. These new companies are trying to solidify themselves but it’s not David vs Goliath, it’s Goliath vs God. I don’t care too much for the state of A.I right now, I care about the long run, and so far Google is the only company that has shown signs of the long term being on lock. What do y’all think? Another thing is that, they don’t seem to be caught up in the capital circle jerk (at least publicly) therefore showing more confidence in themselves. Am I missing something? Let me know. ",

To help me learn foreign languages through comprehensible input.

That's when I needed to see the transcript, to understand what exactly was being said.\n\n2. To help me not forget what I just listened to. There are countless of times when I listened to a podcast episode and after a while I couldn't recall what I heard or I couldn't rewind to a specific quote I liked. Now, I can search for exact phrases, highlight important parts, or even generate summaries to review later\n\n# How does it work?\n\n1. Copy the link of the episode from spOTIFY/Apple podcast.\n\n2. Paste it in the website\n\n3. Click transcribe\n\n4.

        "content": "Hey peeps! Real talk - not here to sell, just want to know if this is actually useful or if I'm solving a problem nobody has.\n\n# The problem I'm trying to solve (two markets):\n\n# For businesses:\n\nYour data is scattered (email, calendar, Slack, invoicing, tasks) and nothing connects it. When something goes wrong, you manually piece together what happened. Takes hours.\n\n# For developers:\n\nEvery AI app you build forgets everything. Chat history in a database isn't real memory. Your users complain their AI \"doesn't remember\" context across sessions.\n\n# What I built:\n\nAn AI memory system that works two ways:\n\n# 1) As a business tool (end-user product):\n\n* Connects your business tools automatically\n* AI answers \"why\" questions by linking data across sources\n* Example: \"Why did revenue drop?\" → AI connects: missed client meetings + delayed payments + team capacity\n* Proactive alerts for patterns/anomalies\n\n# 2) As an API/memory backend (developer platform):\n\n* Memory-as-a-Service for AI applications\n* Give your chatbot/AI agent long-term memory via API\n* Semantic search + knowledge graph + deduplication\n* Multi-tenant, production-ready\n* LangChain integration (2 lines of code to add memory)\n\n# How it works:\n\n|User Type|Process|\n|:-|:-|\n|Business users|• Plug in your tools/apps (5 min setup. AI builds knowledge graph connecting everything. Ask questions in plain English. Get insights you'd never find manually.|\n|Developers|• API endpoint for memory storage/retrieval. Store conversation context, user preferences, historical data. Semantic search with relationship understanding. Your AI remembers forever, not just current session|\n\n# Testing results (not vaporware):\n\n1. 1,700+ live business records processed\n2. 100% query intent accuracy (meetings vs tasks vs people)\n3. Hybrid search 91% more accurate than pure semantic\n4. 288 searches/second, 3.5ms latency\n5. Handles 4,000 items/second data ingestion\n6. TypeScript + Python SDKs (professional, auto-generated)\n\n# My questions:\n\n# For business users:\n\n1. Is scattered data actually a pain point or just \"nice to have\"?\n2. Would you trust AI to \"see\" all your business data?\n3. Fair price: $50-200/month based on data volume?\n\n# For developers:\n\n1. Would you use a memory API for your AI apps? What's missing from current solutions?\n2. Pricing for API: Free tier + $29-99/month based on usage - reasonable?\n3. What would make you choose this over building your own or using Pinecone/vector DBs?\n\n# For everyone:\n\n1. Should I focus on ONE market (business tools OR developer API) or serve both?\n2. Too complex explaining both use cases, or is the dual positioning interesting?\n\n# What I'm worried about:\n\n* Trying to serve two markets = serving neither well\n* Privacy concerns (business side)\n* Too many memory/vector DB tools already (developer side)\n* Can't explain it simply enough\n\n# Current integrations:\n\n* Business: Gmail, Calendar, Outlook, Slack, QuickBooks, but have the ability to easily connect to 250+ other api's.\n* Developer: LangChain, REST API, TypeScript/Python SDKs\n* All with multi-tenant security, production-ready\n\nBe brutally honest - is this solving real problems or am I wasting time? And if it's useful, which market should I focus on first?\n\nThanks for reading! 🙏",

        "content": "Hey Guys,  \nHad chronic back pain for 3 years. Tried everything - stretching, core work, YouTube exercises. Nothing worked. Finally saw a physio. 15 minutes in: \"Your back isn't the problem. Your hips are too tight. Your back is compensating.\"\n\nSpent 3 years and €240+ treating the wrong thing. Most people never get this assessment - expensive, long waitlists. They just stay stuck.\n\nI'm a student with zero medical background. But I thought: \"What if I could automate basic screening?\"  \n**Enter Codex**  \nThis is where Chatgpt became my **technical co-founder**\n\n**Research Translation:** I'd paste dense biomechanics papers I didn't understand. Codex would break them down: \"Here's what matters. Here's how to implement it. Here are the edge cases.\" Stuff that would've taken weeks to learn, explained in minutes.  \n**Pair Programming:** \\~60% of my code initially written by Chatgpt. But it wasn't just code generation - we'd discuss approaches, trade-offs, edge cases. Back and forth. Like actual pair programming.\n\n**The \"Holy Shit\" Moment:** Asked Chatgptto help translate a clinical hip assessment into pose estimation logic. Got back not just code, but a full breakdown of joint angles, camera perspective corrections, and how to handle different body types. I was NOT expecting that level of thinking.\n\n**The Reality Check**: Chatgpt sometimes confidently stated wrong medical facts. I had to verify everything with actual physios. It hallucinated APIs that don't exist. But honestly? Minor compared to what it enabled.\n\n**The Result:**  \nAfter 6  months (nights/weekends): [**previa.health**](http://previa.health)\n\nMovement screening tool that checks where you have restrictions causing your pain - stuff you can't see but your body is compensating around. Works with your phone camera, takes \\~3 min.\n\nWhat it checks:\n\n* Hip mobility - is this causing your back/posture issues?\n* Shoulder mobility - compensating patterns?\n* Asymmetries - left vs right differences?\n* Compensation patterns - where is your body \"cheating\"?\n\n**Demo is live:** [previa.health](http://previa.health)\n\nTakes \\~3 min, **completely free**. Just need your email for results and you'll automatically get **free premium access** when we launch the full version (sort of a thank you for early testing).\n\nWould genuinely appreciate feedback: Does it find something useful? Too generic?  \nWhat would make this actually valuable? It's just a demo right now but I'd appreciate all kinds of feedback!\n\nThanks OpenAI team, changed what I thought I couldnt build alone. 🙏\n\nP.S.: Not a diagnosis tool, but can maybe help you figure out where to start",

        "content": "Today (October 27, 2025) in the federal *OpenAI ChatGPT Copyright Infringement Litigation* case in the Southern District of New York that consolidates fourteen AI copyright cases, Judge Stein in an eighteen-page memorandum refused to dismiss the case at the defendant’s request. In doing so, he made a ruling from which we might read some tea leaves.\n\nOther current federal AI copyright cases such as *Thomson Reuters*, *Kadrey*, and *Bartz* have been dealing with various aspects of copyright law as applied to AI, with some emphasis on the fair use doctrine. One significant discussed aspect is “input-side” infringement, where the focus is on the copying of the plaintiffs’ works, versus “output-side\" infringement, where the focus is on the AI output and how it compares with the plaintiffs’ original work.\n\nIn today’s ruling Judge Stein held that the plaintiffs subject to the motion had adequately pled their copyright infringement case. As part of that, Judge Stein ruled that the plaintiffs have adequately pled “an output-based infringement claim.” He reasoned that if the facts in the plaintiffs’ pleadings are later found to be true, a jury could find certain allegedly infringing ChatGPT outputs to be substantially similar to the plaintiffs’ original works, using as an example two ChatGPT outputs summarizing or pertaining to plaintiff George R.R. Martin’s novel *A Game of Thrones*.\n\nThe ruling explicitly disclaims that it is dealing in any way with fair use.\n\nJudge Stein’s ruling can be found here:\n\n[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354.617.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354/gov.uscourts.nysd.641354.617.0.pdf)\n\nA list of all the AI court cases and rulings can be found here on Reddit:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/s/B0V5Ny2p0j](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/s/B0V5Ny2p0j)",

        "content": "Hey everyone :D\n\nI thought it’d be really interesting to compare how Apple's new A19 Pro (and in turn, the M5) with its fancy **new \"neural accelerators\" in each GPU core** compare to other GPUs!\n\nI ran Gemma 3n 4B on each of these devices, outputting \\~the same 100-word story (at a temp of 0). I used the most optimal inference framework for each to give each their best shot.\n\nHere're the results!\n\n|GPU|Device|Inference Set-Up|Tokens / Sec|Time to First Token|Perf / GPU Core|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|A19 Pro|6 GPU cores; iPhone 17 Pro Max|MLX? (“Local Chat” app)|23.5 tok/s|0.4 s 👀|3.92|\n|M4|10 GPU cores, iPad Pro 13”|MLX? (“Local Chat” app)|33.4 tok/s|1.1 s|3.34|\n|RTX 3080|10 GB VRAM; paired with a Ryzen 5 7600 + 32 GB DDR5|CUDA 12 llama.cpp (LM Studio)|59.1 tok/s|0.02 s|\\-|\n|M4 Pro|16 GPU cores, MacBook Pro 14”, 48 GB unified memory|MLX (LM Studio)|60.5 tok/s 👑|0.31 s|3.69|\n\n# Super Interesting Notes:\n\n**1. The neural accelerators didn't make much of a difference. Here's why!**\n\n* First off, they do indeed significantly accelerate compute! [Taras Zakharko found that](https://tzakharko.github.io/apple-neural-accelerators-benchmark/#:~:text=Metal%20Shading%20Language.-,Key%20Takeaways%3A,-Operation) Matrix FP16 and Matrix INT8 are already accelerated by 4x and 7x respectively!!!\n* BUT, when the LLM spits out tokens, we're limited by memory bandwidth, NOT compute. This is especially true with Apple's iGPUs using the comparatively low-memory-bandwith system RAM as VRAM.\n* Still, there is one stage of inference that is compute-bound: prompt pre-processing! That's why we see the A19 Pro has \\~3x faster Time to First Token vs the M4.\n\n[Max Weinbach's testing](https://www.macstories.net/linked/max-weinbach-on-the-m5s-neural-accelerators/) also corroborates what I found. And it's also worth noting that MLX hasn't been updated (yet) to take full advantage of the new neural accelerators!\n\n**2. My M4 Pro as fast as my RTX 3080!!! It's crazy - 350 w vs 35 w**\n\nWhen you use an MLX model + MLX on Apple Silicon, you get some really remarkable performance. Note that the 3080 also had \\~its best shot with CUDA optimized llama cpp!",

I've been thinking a lot about the role of memory—both in biological and artificial systems—and wanted to pose a question to this community:\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about memory, are we really talking about preserving the past, or is memory fundamentally about enabling something new?\n\n\n\nSome thoughts that prompted this:\n\n\\- In humans, memory is notoriously reconstructive, not just archival. We change our memories every time we recall them.\n\n\\- In AI systems, training data shapes capability, but the model doesn't \"recall\" in the human sense—it generates based on patterns.\n\n\\- Both systems seem to use memory less as a filing cabinet and more as a foundation for creating new thoughts, predictions, behaviors.\n\n\n\nWhat's gained and what's lost in different memory architectures? Should AI systems aim to replicate human memory's plasticity, or pursue something fundamentally different?\n\n\n\nFor those interested in deeper discussions about AI cognition, memory systems, and the nature of thought, I'm part of ongoing conversations exploring these topics. Feel free to DM if you'd like to collaborate or discuss further.\n\n\n\nCurious to hear your perspectives!",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, MiniMax has launched a new model and I thought to talk about this because I was getting a lot of comments asking me to test it. So, that's why I thought to talk about it as well. This is their new model called MiniMax M2, which is an upgrade from the last version called MiniMax M1. The weights are available on Hugging Face as well. I believe it might be open-sourced because the last model was also open-sourced. So, that would be great. Anyway, currently it has been benchmarked by Artificial Analysis. And it is now available for free on Open Router and their API platform. So, you can use it with things like Kilo, Claude Code, and stuff for free. Their own API might have better rate limits than the Open Router one. I haven't tried that, but you can check it out. It allows you to use it as much as you want in almost all kinds of coders and stuff like that. They say that MiniMax M2 is a compact, high-efficiency large language model, optimized for end-to-end coding and agentic workflows. With 10 billion activated parameters (230 billion total), it delivers near-frontier intelligence across general reasoning, tool use, and multi-step task execution, while maintaining low latency and deployment efficiency. So, this is a pretty small model. It's only 230 billion parameters, with about 10 billion activated parameters. So, this is a smaller model than GLM, Kimmy, and others, while being only about 110 billion parameters smaller than GLM 4.5 Air. So, this is quite a good size and can be deployed on local clusters if you're an AI fanatic. If we look at the Artificial Analysis benchmarks, by the way, I don't really find these benchmarks useful at all, apart from the speed or provider variance benchmark, because they mainly use open benchmarks that are very saturated at this point, and many models just straight-up train on them. But if we look at it, then MiniMax M2 scores just below Claude 4.5 Sonnet. The speed is pretty fine as well. And the price is only $0.5 and $2.2 per million tokens, which is not bad at all. The context window sits at about 205,000 tokens. The previous model had about 1 million tokens, but this one doesn't, which is an interesting choice and makes me wonder why they backtracked from it. In the coding index, it comes two points below Sonnet. I mean, I don't know how these benchmarks work, because Grok 4 Fast is not a good coding model. I can tell you that much. And yet it scores above. So, yeah. Also, this is a reasoning model, and it always does reasoning. So, yeah, there's that. It's pretty great at tool calling as well. Anyway, that's about it in the pure old benchmarks. Now, I have obviously tested it on my own benchmarks. And in the floor plan question, it makes a floor plan, but it doesn't make sense at all. It's not good, but it does work, so I scored it accordingly. Then, the panda holding a burger is pretty good. I mean, it's not the best like Gemini 3's checkpoints, but it's probably one of the best among open models. So, this is quite awesome. Then, we have the Pokéball in Three.js, and well, it's not great. It looks more like a premier ball rather than a Pokéball. So, this is not great. The chessboard is also laid out correctly, but it doesn't work. I think this model is heavily trained on GPT-5 outputs, because this kind of UI is generally very GPT-5 like. So, yeah, it's surely trained from that. The Minecraft game also doesn't work. The butterfly flying in the garden is kind of fine. It looks more like a bug to me, but it still works. So, this is also fine. The CLI tool in Rust and the Blender script are also fine, but not great. In the mathematics question, it passes one of them, and it also passes the riddle question. This puts it in the 12th position on my leaderboard, which is below Claude 4 Sonnet, GLM, and DeepSeek Terminus, which is not bad. This, along with GLM and Longcat, are the only models in the top 15 that perform this well. You also have to consider that this is an insanely small model when compared to GLM or DeepSeek. So, this is an awesome win for them. Now, it becomes even more awesome when you see the agentic tests. I mean, this is a true agentic model. So, I did all my agentic tests with Kilo. You can also configure it quite easily there with the MiniMax M2 API or via Open Router. I'm using the Open Router API. So, yeah, it works extremely well with it. This is the first open model I've seen that doesn't give me any edit failures. It's just really good at agentic tasks. The first task was the movie tracker app, and well, it's really good. You get the sliding panels, and you can open up the inner pages. The title bar is not removed here, which is a bit of a minus, but it's still really great. Another thing is that the code quality of this model is insane. It doesn't do any Sonnet-like things, such as hardcoding API keys into the code. And it writes very good code. It even bifurcates the code into different files for better management. It's really good. Similarly, the Go TUI calculator app is also pretty great. You can see that this works really well. Also, it again used every tool in Kilo Code really well. It does search and replace, runs terminal commands, it's just amazing. Then, we go to the Godot game, and well, in Godot, it's just not good. It doesn't know the language and just can't work. So, I won't complain, considering how small and cheap this model is comparatively. So, not bad. It is still pretty good. The open code repo question is still unsolved because it's in Go. It was able to navigate the files correctly, which by itself is a challenge, but it's still not great. And for that matter, even Sonnet can't do this. Then there's the Svelte question, and it's kind of fine in this. It does get to a point where it's somewhat usable. These questions are for long-running tasks, and it's quite good at those as well. So, that's not a problem. It's still better than GLM 4.6 in these cases, as GLM starts to fall apart in some long-running tasks, but this doesn't. So, this is quite great. It can't really do Nuxt coding. So, it's not great at that question. And Rust is also not a strong spot for it. This makes it score the fifth position on the leaderboard. And this is an insanely good model for agentic tasks. It still comes a bit below GLM 4.6. But in general use cases, I'll keep it above GLM, because of how good this model is at long-running tasks. It can keep going for hours, similar to GPT-5. And that is an awesome thing. I think this might be something I'll switch to and leave GLM, but GLM still has their coding plan, which is a great deal. However, considering the super low cost API and the efficiency of this model, it looks like an awesome deal. This is a great model. I'll check it out more and probably do another video about this model in a day or two and talk about the nuances I find with it. Overall, it's pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye."

I mean, \"only on Earth,\" no, I don't think so, but... Sure, sure. But is there-- I suppose what I would dig my heels in a little bit is, is there's a kind of Carl Sagan cosmological view. We're talking about the inevitability almost of life arising according to these laws of chemistry and thermodynamics and so on, and and you get life and then... Is it going to roll on and inevitably give rise to complex life and to humans and to to to intelligence?\n- It's a beautiful thought. It would be lovely if that was how the universe worked. But what we know on Earth is that you have two billion years of stasis and then this apparent singular event where eukaryotes arose, and then another long gap before you get to animals. And then, if you know, if you roll back the clock two million years, there aren't any humans around either. We're just the the the the **WATCH HERE** We're just the icing."
