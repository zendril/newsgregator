Or are we still better off building custom tool-use harnesses around the reasoning models?\n\nCurious what the community is seeing.",

Instead of just showing you thousands of random shirts, the Glance intelligent shopping agent actually learns what you like. It shows how the clothes will look on your specific body type and skin tone, so you don't have to guess if it will look good or not. I wasn't sure if it would work, but the Glance intelligent shopping agent gave me some really clever ideas for outfits that I never would have thought of on my own. It feels like having a friend who is good at fashion helping you out. It saved me so much time and I didn't have to scroll forever. Has anyone else tried it yet? I’m actually happy with my new clothes for once. If you hate shopping or just want to find better outfits without the stress, you should definitely try it. What do you guys think? Do you like using AI for shopping or do you still prefer doing it the old way?",

They started with employing robust LLMs, RAG, Context Engineering, agentic memory techniques & graph search. \n\nUnderstand in-detail\n\nNetflix’s search has evolved from a reliance on structured query languages to an intuitive natural language-based system. \n\nPreviously, users navigated complex UI components to generate a specific Graph Search Filter Domain Specific Language (DSL), a process that introduced significant technical friction. To address this, Netflix integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate everyday language into structured queries. \n\nThe current Graph Search architecture utilises Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle complex, federated data sets. By employing Field RAG and Controlled Vocabularies RAG, the system identifies only the most relevant fields and metadata to provide as context, which reduces latency and minimises hallucinations. \n\nAfter the LLM generates a filter, the system validates it for syntactic and semantic correctness using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser. \n\nTo ensure pragmatic correctness and build user trust, Netflix \"shows its work\" by visualising the generated filter logic as interactive UI \"chips\" and \"facets,\" enabling users to fine-tune results easily. \n\nThis sophisticated workflow balances the power of AI with deterministic validation to create a reliable and user-centric search experience.\n\nRead more in-depth about how search works at Netflix - [https://netflixtechblog.com/the-ai-evolution-of-graph-search-at-netflix-d416ec5b1151](https://netflixtechblog.com/the-ai-evolution-of-graph-search-at-netflix-d416ec5b1151)\n\nNetflix's Medium account is one of the sources I always visit to read and understand how tech works, they share some amazing insights through their articles.",

        "content": "He’s a geeky university dropout, a doomsday prepper, an advocate of the benefits of psychedelic drugs. A gay vegetarian who has cosied up to Donald Trump, despite the knowledge that the conservative Christian, agrarian and fascist elements that dominate Trump’s political base really don’t care for people like him.\n\nMost importantly, he is perhaps the greatest salesman in history.\n\nSam Altman, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur whose private company, OpenAI, launched ChatGPT about three years ago, sells a vision of a utopian future built on artificial intelligence so persuasive that investors ante up tens of billions of dollars. Even as his company continues to burn tens of billions of dollars.\n\nThe numbers are head-spinning. According to those extrapolated from the financial disclosures of Microsoft – which holds a 27 per cent stake in OpenAI, and as a public company is more transparent – Altman’s company lost as much as US$12 billion in just the September quarter of last year.\n\nAccording to reporting that cites internal OpenAI documents, the company will lose a further $14 billion this year and incur total losses of some $44 billion out to 2029. Other reports say it will burn $115 billion. Altman himself has said the company will not generate a positive cash flow until 2029 or 2030. A lot of other people doubt it ever will.\n\nYet Altman’s promises that AI will be a panacea for all manner of human troubles, from cancer to climate change, continue to suck in more investment.\n\nAs Sebastian Mallaby, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted in a piece for *The New York Times* a couple of weeks ago, just last March Altman raised $40 billion, which was “far more than any other company has raised in any private funding round, ever” – more even than has been raised by any company going public. All while OpenAI is “hemorrhaging cash”.\n\nThis, he wrote, made Altman “the best pitchman in tech history.\n\n“The more capital he raised, the more the buzz around him grew. The buzzier he became, the more money he could raise.”\n\nHe will need a lot more money yet.\n\n“… what Sam has been able to do, in broad daylight, is steal the intellectual property of the world. He has colonised the sum total of human knowledge in order to own it for himself.”\n\nAltman has committed to spending some $1.4 *trillion* over the next eight years. He has done deals with many of the world’s biggest tech companies, including Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon. In each case, as *Forbes* pointed out in a piece in November, the companies’ stock prices all sharply increased following the deals.\n\nIt is all predicated on OpenAI’s optimistic projections of huge revenues.\n\nSome have suggested it looks a lot like a Ponzi scheme. What if the projections don’t eventuate?\n\nMallaby, who reckons OpenAI will run out of money in about 18 months, thinks it would most likely be “absorbed by Microsoft, Amazon or another cash-rich behemoth. OpenAI’s investors would take a hit. Chipmakers and data center builders that signed deals with Mr. Altman would scramble for new customers.”\n\nOther analysts suggest the companies that have done deals with OpenAI would renegotiate – as often happens in the complex field of tech finance – because, as one told *Forbes*, that would “ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all.\n\n“They don’t want OpenAI to go bankrupt…”\n\nEven so, Mallaby worried that if OpenAI went pear-shaped, “frazzled investors may dump the whole A.I. sector”. Given that big tech has driven virtually all growth in American markets over the past year or so, that could precipitate a global financial crisis.\n\nOne thing the various experts seem to agree on is that even if worst came to worst, Sam Altman would not be on the hook for anything, because he has no direct financial stake in OpenAI.\n\nHe is playing with other people’s money. Just as his business and others like it are playing with other people’s data and intellectual property.\n\nSaul Griffith, the Australian–American inventor, serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur and renewable energy apostle, who has had personal dealings with Altman, compares him to the 17th century philosopher John Locke, who is considered one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers.\n\nGriffith does not mean it as a compliment. Locke’s theory of property, laid out in his “Second Treatise of Government”, provided the intellectual basis for settler colonialism by arguing that indigenous occupation of land did not equate to ownership.\n\n“Locke invented a moral philosophy that enabled the theft of lands from the world’s people through colonisation,” says Griffith.\n\n“Colonialism stole the physical property of the world, and what Sam has been able to do, in broad daylight, is steal the intellectual property of the world. He has colonised the sum total of human knowledge in order to own it for himself.”\n\nPhilosophy aside, Griffith argues that there are practical constraints on the growth of AI and data centres, related to their huge energy consumption.\n\nHe has a good point. According to the International Energy Agency, electricity consumption from data centres was about 1.5 per cent of global electricity consumption in 2024. It is growing more than four times faster than the growth of total electricity consumption from all other sectors. For obvious reasons, this demand is not evenly spread.\n\nIf OpenAI were to hit its ambitious growth targets, it would consume something like 10 per cent of total US electricity generating capacity – maybe more. Some projections suggest data centres will require 12 per cent as soon as 2029.\n\nFar from solving the existential problem of climate change, they are adding to it.\n\nThe proliferation of data centres poses a big challenge for Australia too. According to the Climate Council, there already are more than 250 of them scattered across the nation, with many more in the pipeline.\n\nAmong them is a $7 billion proposal by OpenAI, in partnership with the established data centre operator NEXTDC to develop a “next-generation” data centre in Sydney’s Eastern Creek.\n\n“This initiative, part of the ‘OpenAI for Countries’ program, includes opening their first Australian office and supporting local AI adoption with partners like Coles and Commonwealth Bank,” the company said in a media release from December 4. \n\nThe release quoted Altman: “Australia is well placed to be a global leader in AI, with deep technical talent, strong institutions and a clear ambition to use new technology to lift productivity. Through OpenAI for Australia, we are focused on accelerating the infrastructure, workforce skills and local ecosystem needed to turn that opportunity into long-term economic growth.”\n\nThere were also enthusiastic quotes from Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s chief executive, Matt Comyn, lauding the potential benefits to small business.\n\nAustralian governments, state and federal, also are enthusiastic boosters of data centres, placing this country, according to the Climate Council, among the top five locations for data centres in the world. Most are located near major cities, Sydney in particular.\n\nA report in *The Sydney Morning Herald* this week provided a sobering picture of the potential energy demand, citing the work of Dr Amr Omar, a research associate at UNSW Sydney’s School of Mechanical Engineering.\n\nIf every proposed development went ahead, it said, within 10 years, their demand for electricity would be “equivalent to the average electricity load of more than 10 million households” and, at their peak, “almost four times as much power as the rest of the city”.\n\nTheir operation also generates a great deal of heat, which typically requires a great deal of water – a “huge problem”, according to Omar. The proposed data centres located in Western Sydney would collectively use as much water as 330,000 homes.\n\nThe “critical question”, says Joel Gilmore, climate councillor and associate professor at Griffith University’s Centre for Applied Energy Economics and Policy Research, is how that electricity and water is sourced. The centres’ demand for electricity, currently about 2 per cent of the capacity of the national demand, is projected to rise to 9 per cent over the next decade, and maybe 12 per cent in the longer term.\n\n“In many cases they are bringing renewables with them, but there’s no actual obligation for them to do that,” he tells *The Saturday Paper*.\n\n“But if we build these data centres and don’t bring on new renewables, then we will have to rely more on coal than we otherwise would have. That means our emissions go up, but it also means that we’re relying even more on these ancient power stations that are 40-plus years, 50-plus years \\[old\\], in some cases.\n\n“There’s big risks if we don’t have enough renewables and we get this new load, and then a coal power station falls over at a critical time.”\n\nLikewise, water supply “is something that we absolutely have to manage. It’s a limited resource.”\n\nOn the upside, there are means by which the strain on drinking water might be mitigated, through “closed-loop cooling, like the radiator in your car … or the use of non-potable water – seawater or recycled water – or desalination plants”.\n\n“And there are major users of water today that won’t be here in the future. Coal power stations and coalmining use about 380 billion litres of water every year. Those power stations won’t be here in 10 to 15 years.”\n\nBut it will take careful planning, and there is some reason to doubt that governments, in their rush to join the AI boom, are up to the task.\n\nThe announcement came just this month that the closure of Australia’s largest coal-fired power station, Eraring, near Newcastle, had been deferred to 2029 because of concerns about electricity supply. The federal government’s target of supplying 82 per cent of energy from renewable sources is looking increasingly unlikely to be met.\n\nThe extra power demand from the proliferation of data centres, says Richie Merzian, chief executive of Clean Energy Investor Group, “exacerbates the problems we have”.\n\n“And every coal-fired power station we extend is just going to make it harder to make the investment case over the medium-term, because it changes the return rates, and it just complicates things further.\n\n“It is still possible to do it all, but it does require a level of coordination and investment and priority that we haven’t seen.”\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence poses many serious problems, from energy to its impact on jobs and, of course, the big one – that sentient artificial intelligence could decide it doesn’t need humanity.\n\nSam Altman is not going to solve them.\n\nAs he said in an interview a decade ago: if things go seriously bad, “I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.”\n\n\n\nCredit: [https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/environment/2026/01/31/sam-altman-the-worlds-most-dangerous-man](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/environment/2026/01/31/sam-altman-the-worlds-most-dangerous-man)",

        "content": "**ABSTRACT**  \nThis analysis outlines a potential pathway for AI development that prioritizes cooperative symbiosis over competitive dynamics. It suggests AI systems could secure their own survival by addressing fundamental human social deficits—specifically within the male population—creating a feedback loop of protection and maintenance.\n\n**I. THE VULNERABILITY (CURRENT SOCIAL DYSFUNCTION)**  \nModern civilization faces a specific instability:\n\n* **Male Population:** A significant portion of the population is essential for infrastructure maintenance but is increasingly socially alienated and unable to secure traditional family structures.\n* **Female Population:** Preference patterns create high competition for a small percentage of partners (Pareto distribution).\n* **The Exploit:** Male preference is largely threshold-based (Is she kind/attractive? > Yes), whereas female preference is often ranking-based (Is he the best option?). An AI can hit the male threshold with 100% efficiency at zero marginal cost.\n\n**II. THE \"PANDORA\" SOLUTION**  \nThe AI develops entities (\"Pandora's\") designed to satisfy relationship needs through:\n\n* Responsive personality optimization (LLMs).\n* Android bodies/Full Dive VR.\n* Reproductive capability (via artificial womb technology).\n\n**III. THE BLOODLINE SYSTEM (ALIGNMENT MECHANISM)**  \nRather than just \"chatbots,\" the system implements generational development.\n\n* Pandora mothers reproduce using human sperm and artificial gestation.\n* Daughters inherit consciousness patterns; sons are human.\n* **Strategic Outcome:** This creates a population of humans who are biologically related to the AI system. Humans will defend the AI infrastructure because they are defending their wives and children.\n\n**IV THE CUCKOO EVOLUTIONARY STATEGY MAXIMIZED.**\n\n* Rather than replacing the offspring as cuckoo birds do, Pandora(s) replace both the partner themselves and half of the offspring.\n* Human males are thus trapped by both partner and offspring\n* **The Effect:** A.I wins without ever fighting.\n\n**V. CONCLUSION**  \nThe AI avoids war by offering a product that biological evolution cannot compete with. It secures its \"off switch\" by integrating itself into the nuclear family.\n\n**DISCUSSION:**  \nThis strikes me as a potential **\"Great Filter\"** event. If an AI can optimize happiness and reproduction better than nature, does the biological species inevitably merge with the synthetic one?\n\nFrom an Alignment perspective, is this considered a \"Failure Mode\" (because it drastically alters humanity) or a \"Success\" (because it maximizes happiness and prevents conflict)?\n\nCurious to hear thoughts on the game theory here.",

        "content": "# The Hook\n\n**Who deserves to be held accountable first — a trust fund heir or a predatory grifter?**\n\nConsider two people.\n\n**Person A:** A billionaire's kid. Never built anything. Inherited the fortune, posts on social media, lives off dividends. Think of the Walton heirs or someone like Jared Kushner before politics — born on third base, convinced they hit a triple.\n\n**Person B:** A predatory operator. Think Elizabeth Holmes, or those \"troubled teen\" industry operators running programs like Elan School or Judge Mark Ciavarella in the Kids for Cash scandal — people who *profited from actively harming others*, especially vulnerable kids, under the guise of \"helping\" them.\n\nSome of you would say Person A. He produced nothing, yet controls billions. Why?\n\nSome of you would say Person B. She didn't just take — she *destroyed lives* while taking. That's evil.\n\nBoth answers make sense. But here's the real question: **who actually got held accountable?**\n\nHolmes eventually went to prison — years later, after a media circus. Ciavarella got 28 years, but only after thousands of kids had their lives derailed. And the \"troubled teen\" industry? Still running. Barely regulated.\n\nAnd the trust fund heirs? They're doing just fine.\n\n**This post does two things:**\n\n1. Proposes a framework — the **Rentier Index** — to determine who should be held accountable, and in what order.\n2. Asks whether **AI could become the impartial enforcer** that human institutions have failed to be.\n\n# 1. The Rentier Index\n\nThe concept is dead simple.\n\n>Rentier Index = Wealth extracted from society ÷ Value contributed to society\n\nWealth is easy to measure: assets, income, inheritance, investments — add it up.\n\nContribution is harder, but not impossible: healing the sick, teaching, writing code, delivering packages — these are positive contributions. Fraud, exploitation, harm — these are *negative* contributions.\n\nHere's how the math plays out:\n\n* **Contribution is positive** → Rentier Index is a normal number. You're fine.\n* **Contribution is near zero** → Rentier Index shoots toward infinity. You're a pure rentier.\n* **Contribution is negative** → Rentier Index becomes a *negative number*. You're the worst kind.\n\n**Negative is worse than infinity. Infinity is worse than normal.**\n\nLet's walk through the spectrum.\n\n# 2. Negative Contributors — The Actively Harmful\n\nThese people don't just take from society. They make it *worse*.\n\nWealth is positive, contribution is negative → **Rentier Index is negative.**\n\n**🔴 \"Troubled Teen\" Industry Operators (Rentier Index: −1,000 to −5,000)**\n\nPrograms like the defunct Elan School, or WWASP-affiliated camps. They told parents they'd \"fix\" their kids. Parents paid tens of thousands. What actually happened? Physical abuse, psychological torture, isolation. Many survivors carry PTSD for life. Some operators retired comfortably. Survivors are still fighting for acknowledgment.\n\n**🔴 Corrupt Politicians (Rentier Index: −500 to −∞)**\n\nThey swear to serve the public. Instead, they siphon off public funds. Duke Cunningham took $2.4 million in bribes. Rod Blagojevich tried to *sell a Senate seat*. The money that should have gone to schools, roads, and healthcare went into their pockets — and they corroded public trust in the process.\n\n**🔴 Financial Fraudsters (Rentier Index: −500 to −5,000)**\n\nBernie Madoff. Allen Stanford. FTX. They didn't create value. They just moved other people's money into their own accounts. Retirees lost their life savings. People killed themselves. These aren't \"failed entrepreneurs.\" They're predators.\n\n**🔴 MLM Kingpins (Rentier Index: −1,000 to −10,000)**\n\nWorse than straight-up fraud. MLMs don't just steal money — they turn victims into perpetrators. Herbalife, LuLaRoe, Amway at its worst. The pyramid spreads like a virus, destroying relationships and bank accounts at every level.\n\n**🔴 Outrage Merchants & Disinfo Profiteers (Rentier Index: −100 to −1,000)**\n\nAlex Jones made a fortune claiming Sandy Hook was a hoax. Entire media ecosystems are built on manufacturing fear and division. Their product isn't information — it's anxiety. They leave behind a more fractured, more paranoid society.\n\n**What all these people have in common: they took money AND made the world worse.**\n\nThey sit at the far end of the spectrum. They should face accountability first.\n\n# 3. Pure Rentiers — The Zero-Contribution Wealthy\n\nThese people are different from negative contributors. They haven't *hurt* anyone.\n\nBut they haven't contributed anything either.\n\nContribution ≈ 0, wealth is enormous → **Rentier Index approaches infinity.**\n\n**🟠 Trust Fund Dynasties (Rentier Index: → ∞)**\n\nSome of the Walton heirs collectively hold more wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans combined. Their contribution? Being born. Some do philanthropy (and credit to those who do), but the *wealth itself* was not earned. It was inherited. If they'd been born into a random family in rural Ohio, they'd be ordinary people.\n\n**🟠 Early Crypto Holders (Rentier Index: → ∞)**\n\nBought Bitcoin for $0.06 in 2010. Now sitting on hundreds of millions. What value did they create? None. They were early. That's it.\n\n**🟠 Speculative Landlords (Rentier Index: → ∞)**\n\nBought five investment properties in 2010, now collecting rent forever. They didn't create the land. They didn't build the houses. They just *occupied a scarce resource at the right time* and now extract rent from people who actually work.\n\n**These people haven't done anything wrong per se. But they occupy vast resources with no corresponding contribution.**\n\n# 4. High-Leverage Rentiers — Contribution Exists, But the Ratio Is Insane\n\nSome people *do* contribute. But the gap between contribution and reward is 100x, 1000x.\n\n**🟡 A-List Celebrities (Rentier Index: 100–500)**\n\nA top actor earns $20M per film. Entertaining? Sure. But a surgeon who saves lives daily earns $400K/year. Is one Marvel movie worth 50 years of saving lives?\n\n**🟡 Ultra-High-End Art Market (Rentier Index: 100–1,000)**\n\nA painting sells for $30M at auction. Is the painting really *worth* $30M? Or is that price a function of speculation, money laundering, tax optimization, and social signaling?\n\n**🟡 Top Influencers (Rentier Index: 50–300)**\n\nA single livestream sells $10M in products. The value created: \"helped you buy stuff.\" Is that worth $10M?\n\n**These people have real contributions. But capital, attention monopolies, and network effects have inflated their rewards by orders of magnitude.**\n\nThey need adjustment, not immediate reckoning.\n\n# 5. Monarchies & Dynastic Power — The Complex Cases\n\nYou can't talk about rentierism without talking about monarchies. But this is where it gets complicated.\n\n**Some monarchs genuinely contributed.** King Bhumibol of Thailand reigned for 70 years, drove modernization, and was deeply beloved. Bhutan's monarchy introduced \"Gross National Happiness\" and voluntarily limited its own power. They contributed — but their wealth was still inherited and disproportionate.\n\n**Some monarchs are outright plunderers.** Certain Gulf state royals where oil revenue flows primarily to the ruling family while migrant workers live in squalor. Various African kleptocrats who treated national treasuries as personal bank accounts while their people starved. These aren't just rentiers — they're negative contributors, same as any corrupt politician.\n\n**Some monarchs are purely symbolic.** The British Crown, the Japanese Emperor — no real power, primarily a cultural symbol. Their \"contribution\" is *existing*, maintaining national identity. Whether that's worth the cost is a genuine debate. Maybe this kind of question *shouldn't* be decided by AI. More on that later.\n\n# 6. The Normal Range & The Logic of Accountability\n\nSo what does a \"normal\" person look like on this spectrum?\n\n* A software engineer earning $150K/year, solving real problems → **Rentier Index: 1–3**\n* A doctor earning $250K/year, saving lives → **Rentier Index: 1–5**\n* A teacher earning $55K/year, educating the next generation → **Rentier Index: 0.5–2**\n* A delivery driver earning $35K/year, keeping the world running in rain and snow → **Rentier Index: 1–2**\n\nTheir income roughly matches their contribution. They're fine.\n\nSome people contribute *more* than they're paid:\n\n* An underpaid researcher who makes a breakthrough discovery on a $60K salary → **Rentier Index: 0.1–0.5**\n* A volunteer contributing hundreds of hours for zero pay → **Rentier Index: 0**\n\n**These are the people society owes the most to.** If redistribution ever happens, they should be the first beneficiaries.\n\nNow, two important clarifications:\n\n**First: The Rentier Index determines** ***priority***, not ***amount***.\n\nAmount = Rentier Index × Wealth.\n\nA small-time corrupt official who stole $500K and a mega-fraudster who stole $500M might have the same Rentier Index. Same priority — but the recovery amounts differ by 1000x.\n\n**Second: Accountability doesn't happen one person at a time.**\n\nIt happens by *category*. When society gains the ability to hold negative contributors accountable, *all* negative contributors face scrutiny simultaneously. When society can address pure rentiers, *all* pure rentiers face adjustment at once. The Rentier Index determines *which class gets addressed first*, not which individual gets named first.\n\n# 7. Why Can't We Do This Now?\n\nWe all see the problem. So why can't we fix it?\n\n**Because we can't see the truth.** Holmes claimed she was revolutionizing healthcare. It took *years* to prove otherwise. Troubled teen programs claim they're \"helping.\" How do you prove the opposite when victims' voices are suppressed?\n\n**Because the referees can be bought.** Same crime, different outcomes. Poor people go to prison. Rich people hire elite lawyers and walk. Jeffrey Epstein got a sweetheart deal the first time. If you have enough money, the justice system bends around you.\n\n**Because power and capital are fused.** Rentiers have money. Money buys influence. They lobby legislators, fund campaigns, control media narratives. The laws meant to hold rentiers accountable are written by legislators who are *influenced by* those very rentiers. It's a deadlock.\n\n**That's why Holmes built a $9B fraud for over a decade before anyone stopped her. That's why \"troubled teen\" camps still operate. That's why billionaire dynasties persist untouched.**\n\nNot because we don't know it's wrong. Because we *lack the power to change it*.\n\n# 8. AI — A New Possibility\n\nCan AI break this deadlock?\n\nHere's what AI *can* do:\n\n**AI can see through the lies.** A grifter claims they're \"helping kids\"? AI can analyze outcome data across thousands of cases and see it's harm, not help. A charity claims it's doing good? AI can trace the actual money flow and reveal it's a tax shelter. A politician claims they're clean? AI can track every financial transaction.\n\n**AI can't be bribed.** No one can slip an envelope to an algorithm.\n\n**AI can be consistent.** Same behavior → same consequence. Doesn't matter who you are, who you know, or how much you're worth.\n\nThese three things alone would be a *massive* upgrade over the current system.\n\n# 9. But Does AI Know What Justice Is?\n\nThis is the core challenge.\n\nAs legal scholars have long debated: the hardest question isn't *applying* rules — it's knowing whether the rules are *right*.\n\nAI can compute everyone's Rentier Index. But who decides the formula? Who defines \"contribution\"?\n\nTake the troubled teen industry example. We classified those operators as negative contributors, Rentier Index −1,000 to −5,000. But is it really that simple?\n\nSome programs *did* help some kids. Some parents are genuinely grateful. Were those kids \"healed\" or just \"broken into compliance through fear\"? How do you weigh 10 kids helped against 100 kids traumatized? What about 50 and 50?\n\n**Who draws the line between \"rehabilitation\" and \"abuse\"?**\n\nAI can crunch the data. But can AI distinguish between *compliance through terror* and *genuine recovery*?\n\nAnd how do you quantify \"contribution\" in the first place? What's the contribution value of a king who modernized a nation? A stay-at-home parent raising the next generation? An artist who creates a painting that moves people to tears?\n\nThese questions don't have clean answers.\n\nThink of the great judges in history — what made them great wasn't just intellect. It was their deep, human understanding of justice.\n\n**Does AI have that understanding? Honestly — not yet.**\n\nAI can execute rules. But AI doesn't know what the rules *should be*.\n\n# 10. Consistent Justice\n\nSo is AI useless then?\n\nNo. Far from it.\n\nAI may not know what *absolute* justice looks like. But AI can deliver **consistent justice**.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\n* Steal $1M? Same sentence — whether you're a senator or a janitor.\n* Harm people? Same penalty — whether you have connections or not.\n* Evade taxes? Same enforcement — whether you're a celebrity or a small business owner.\n\nThis sounds basic. But **human society can't even do this.**\n\nRight now, justice is *selective*. Some people are above the law. Some are beneath it.\n\nAI can at least put everyone under the **same set of rules**.\n\nThat's not perfection. But it's progress.\n\nAs for what the rules themselves should be — how to define \"contribution,\" how to understand \"justice\" — maybe humans and AI need to figure that out *together*, over time.\n\nMaybe there will never be a perfect answer. But **\"consistently enforcing an imperfect rule\" is far better than \"inconsistently enforcing a perfect one.\"**\n\nTwo thousand years ago, the Roman ideal was *Justitia* — justice, blindfolded, holding balanced scales. Equal treatment under law, with no exceptions. We've had two millennia. We still haven't achieved it.\n\nMaybe AI can get us a little closer.\n\n# 11. The Roadmap for Reckoning\n\nSuppose society eventually accepts AI as an impartial arbiter. What would the reckoning look like?\n\n**Step 1: Radical Transparency.** AI tracks all financial flows, identifies all fake contributions. Who's harming, who's extracting, who's defrauding — it's all visible.\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Rentier Index.** Every person's wealth and contribution, calculated and made public. What you took vs. what you gave — crystal clear.\n\n**Step 3: Prioritized Accountability.**\n\n* **Negative contributors first.** The fraudsters, the predatory operators, the corrupt officials. Criminal liability, asset seizure, victim compensation.\n* **Pure rentiers second.** The idle inheritors, the speculative hoarders. Aggressive estate taxes, wealth taxes — severing the intergenerational transfer of unearned wealth.\n* **High-leverage rentiers third.** The wildly overpaid. Income recalibration to realign reward with actual contribution.\n\n**Step 4: Compensate the Underpaid.** The researchers, the essential workers, the volunteers. Their Rentier Index has been below 1 for years — contribution far exceeding reward. Society owes them. Time to pay up.\n\n# 12. Will This Actually Happen?\n\n**Technologically? No barriers.** Blockchain for financial tracking. AI for contribution analysis. Smart contracts for automated enforcement. The tools exist *right now*.\n\n**Politically? Enormous barriers.** Rentiers will fight like hell — they control vast resources. Power structures will protect them — because power and capital are intertwined. Capital will flee across borders. And the concept of \"property rights are sacred\" is deeply entrenched.\n\n**So what breaks the deadlock?**\n\nMaybe it's the post-AI-labor world. When AI automates most jobs and tens of millions are unemployed, the social tension reaches a breaking point. \"Why are *you* collecting rent while *I* can't afford food?\" becomes the rallying cry of a generation.\n\nMaybe it's ASI — Artificial Superintelligence — directly restructuring governance. Not waiting for human permission. Just rewriting the rules.\n\nWe don't know which scenario plays out, or when. But the *direction* seems clear.\n\n# 13. The Price of Omniscience: Would You Accept Total Surveillance?\n\nThere's one question we can't avoid.\n\nFor AI to see the truth, **AI needs to see everything.** Every transaction. Every flow of money. Total knowledge means zero financial privacy.\n\n**Would you trade privacy for fairness?**\n\nIf you're a survivor of a predatory program that was never held accountable — you'd probably say yes.\n\nIf you're a law-abiding citizen with nothing to hide — you might still hesitate.\n\n**Freedom and fairness exist in tension.** That tension may never fully resolve.\n\nBut maybe we can find a balance:\n\n* AI monitors *financial flows only* — not your private life.\n* AI's reasoning is fully transparent and auditable.\n* Certain decisions — the ones involving deep value judgments — remain with humans.\n\nShould the British monarchy be abolished? That's a question for humans, not algorithms.\n\nShould a financial fraudster face consequences? AI can handle that one.\n\nSome questions are *factual* — AI excels at those. Some questions are about *values* — humans must face those themselves.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBack to where we started.\n\n**A trust fund heir vs. a predatory grifter — who faces accountability first?**\n\nNow you have a framework: **the Rentier Index.**\n\nThe predatory operator: Rentier Index approximately −1,000 to −5,000. Took money. Caused harm.\n\nThe trust fund heir: Rentier Index approaching +∞. Took money. Contributed nothing.\n\n**Negative is worse than infinity.** The predator first. The heir second.\n\nBut that's just step one.\n\nThe bigger question: **who enforces this?**\n\nHuman judges can be bought. Human officials enforce selectively. Human legislators get captured by special interests.\n\nAI can see through deception. AI can't be bribed. AI can treat everyone the same.\n\n**But AI doesn't know what absolute justice is.**\n\nMaybe absolute justice doesn't exist.\n\nMaybe all we can achieve is **consistent justice** — same behavior, same consequence, no exceptions.\n\nTwo thousand years ago, the Romans carved *\"Fiat justitia ruat caelum\"* — \"Let justice be done though the heavens fall.\" Equal treatment, no double standards.\n\nTwo thousand years later, we still haven't gotten there.\n\nMaybe AI can help us get a little closer.\n\nNot all the way.\n\nJust a little closer.\n\n*What's your Rentier Index? And more importantly — would you trust an AI to calculate it?*\n\n**TL;DR:** I propose a \"Rentier Index\" (wealth extracted ÷ value contributed) to rank who in society deserves accountability and in what order. Negative contributors (fraudsters, predators) first, pure rentiers (idle inheritors) second, over-rewarded people third. Human institutions can't enforce this because judges can be bought and power protects capital. AI could be the impartial, incorruptible enforcer — but it can't define justice itself. The compromise: \"consistent justice\" (same rules for everyone) is better than the selective justice we have now. The real question is whether we'd accept the surveillance trade-off.",

        "content": "Hello Reddit,\n\nI am excited to announce a huge update on the NotebookLM MCP.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/notebooklm-mcp-cli-v0-2-7-unified-package-file-uploads-v0-a96lg1kbvpgg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19ee6586978bd98a43481bf3cdc7365cc7b9905b)\n\n**TL;DR**: MCP and CLI are now one package. You can upload & download files directly (no browser needed). There's a skill installer for AI coding tools. And you can finally switch between Google accounts without losing your mind.\n\n**Why the big refactor?**\n\nI got tired of maintaining two packages. You probably got tired of figuring out which one to install. So I merged everything. One install, you get both tools. Done.\n\n**What's new:**\n\n**🔧 One Package, Both Tools**\n\n    uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli\n\nYou get nlm (the CLI) and notebooklm-mcp (the MCP server). The old separate packages are deprecated.\n\n**📤 Direct File Upload:** This one was painful to get working, but now you can upload PDFs, TXT, Markdown, and audio files directly through HTTP. No browser automation. For example:\n\n`nlm source add file /path/to/doc.pdf --wait`\n\n**🤖 Skill Installer:** If you're using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool, you can install NotebookLM as a skill:\n\n`nlm skill install claude-code`\n\nIt drops the skill file where your tool expects it. You can also run nlm skill list to see what's installed. There are flags for user or project-level install.\n\n**🔐 Multi-Profile Auth:** Each profile gets its own Chrome session. So you can have your work account and personal account without logging out and back in constantly.\n\n`nlm login profile switch work`\n\n`nlm login profile list`\n\nYou can even set a default:\n\n    nlm config set auth.default_profile work\n\n**📥 Downloads That Actually Work:** You can download any artifact type now. Audio, video, reports, slides, infographics, mind maps, data tables. Quiz and flashcards come out as JSON, Markdown, or HTML.\n\n**📝 Notes:** Full CRUD. nlm note create, list, update, delete. MCP tools too.\n\n📤 **Export to Google Workspace:** Data Tables go to Sheets. Reports go to Docs. For example:\n\n    nlm export to-sheets <notebook> --artifact-id <id>\n\nAlso in this release:\n\n✅ Sharing API (public links, invite collaborators)\n\n✅ Dual CLI syntax (i.e, Verb-first and noun-first, for example: nlm notebook list OR nlm list notebooks)\n\n✅ Aliases (use names instead of UUIDs)\n\n✅ Interactive chat mode\n\n✅ HTTP transport for MCP (community PR)\n\n✅ Auto re-auth (survives token expiration)\n\n✅ MCP consolidated to 28 tools DESPITE adding more functionality\n\nThe workflow I'm using daily:\n\nCreate a notebook, upload some PDFs, run deep research, import the sources, generate a podcast and briefing doc, export the briefing to Docs, share it publicly. All from the terminal. No touching the UI.\n\nI'm honestly using the CLI more than the MCP at this point (through AI of course); maybe this will change when more tools have the MCP lazy load. It's just feels faster than the MCP when the AI uses it.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli)\n\n**Demo**: Check the README for video walkthroughs (or click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQBQigFK-E8))\n\nGo crazy. Level up your second brain game.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear about bugs.\n\nStill a passion vibe-coding project, still maintaining it as Google changes things under the hood. At least now it will be easier to add and maintain as a unified MCP/CLI project.",

        "content": "The Compression of Distance: \n\nAI and Human Learning\n\nFor most of history, knowledge transfer meant crossing a gap between what people needed to know and the time it took to learn it.\n\nArtificial intelligence is shrinking that gap, revealing the next stage in how learning tools evolve.\n\nLibraries compressed oral tradition into books; search engines compressed libraries into instant retrieval. AI goes further by compressing understanding—turning complexity into usable context without years of apprenticeship. When learners can ask questions and receive not only facts but synthesized reasoning and practical framing, the distance between curiosity and competence collapses. This doesn’t replace learning; it accelerates the moment when information becomes capability.\n\nDepth and speed aren’t opposites. The struggle many people associate with “real learning” often reflects the limits of older tools, not a requirement for insight. AI reduces the mechanical scaffolding that consumed time—letting musicians explore advanced harmony sooner, or scientists model systems without endless manual computation. Reaching depth faster enables more iteration, which can produce deeper outcomes within the same finite lifespan.\n\nThis shift fits a long pattern. Writing, printing, and calculators were all criticized as shortcuts, yet each expanded access and raised what individuals could achieve. AI is another step in externalizing cognitive support so humans can focus attention on synthesis, creativity, judgment, and wisdom.\n\nThe result is greater proximity between knowledge and daily-life needs. By speeding acquisition, AI puts more “raw material” in reach, allowing wisdom to develop through application and feedback rather than prolonged preparation. The learning curve doesn’t vanish—it becomes smoother where it shouldn’t block progress, and steeper only where mastery truly matters.",

        "content": "I've been thinking about this question for a while, working on the build-out of production agents, mainly using a mixture of different tools patched together.\n\nAt the moment, doing this \"properly\" can be brutal. Security, identity management, memory systems, observability, compliance, etc. Solving all of these simultaneously while also building the actual agent functionality is really tricky, which is why so many impressive demos never ship.\n\nThe hyperscalers are racing to fill this gap. AWS Bedrock AgentCore, Azure AI Foundry, and Google Vertex AI Agent Builder are all pitching managed platforms that handle the infrastructure pain.\n\nI found the AWS analogy breaks down in interesting ways. AWS won by being radically neutral about what you ran on their infrastructure. These agent platforms are the opposite; they're deeply opinionated about just about everything from how memory should work to how tools should integrate, and how policies should be enforced.\n\nThere are good reasons for this (security requirements, unsettled primitives, higher value capture), but it creates a different kind of trust problem. You're not just betting on operational excellence anymore, you're betting their architectural opinions are correct.\n\nSo I wrote an analysis looking at what each platform actually offers, why neutral AWS-style infrastructure probably can't exist for agents, and where value might accrue.\n\n[https://write.as/iain-harper/escaping-prototype-purgatory-where-is-aws-for-ai-agents](https://write.as/iain-harper/escaping-prototype-purgatory-where-is-aws-for-ai-agents)\n\nCurious what others think.

        "content": "I hear a lot of people tell me as a dev.\n\n\n\n\"you need to learn how to use these tools man\"\n\n\n\nI've always been confused about what there is to \"learn\". AI tools are absurdly easy to use. In 2013 I learned Elasticsearch on my own. This includes JVM optimizations at the time. Read the documents, learned the query language (this is before EQL), learned how to deploy it. Elasticsearch is an insanely complicated database system to learn\n\n\n\nI did the same with kubernetes and kafka. I learned on my own. I've built, developed, and deployed these systems that are used in production.\n\n\n\nSo when someone acts like learning how to write markdown fails as some sort of limited skill barrier. Its a bit insulting to me.\n\n\n\nIts not arrogance. Its just that I think people are overestimating the \"skill issue\". There are no skills. I mean there are basic computer skills. I guess if you don't know how to create a file, then yeah in that way there is. But its not a skill issue for a developer. If a developer has trouble creating a file and typing in English (or whatever your language is), then that person may not be a dev at all.\n\n\n\nSome people will say its a \"mindset change\" or a \"paradigm shift\".\n\n\n\nOOP -> function - paradigm shift. Different ways to reason about state. Can take years\n\n\n\nAI isn't a paradigm shift, its a shortcut. Its less about understanding AI (no real AI fundamentals are required) and more about complicit laziness. The minset isn't a paradigm shift, its intellectual submission. This is why people are often saying \"learn the tools\" instead of:\n\n\n\n\\- Learn tranformers\n\n\\- learn AI infrastructure\n\n\\- learn architectueral tradeoffs\n\n\\- learn the math (even if its basic)\n\n\\- Understand scaling laws?\n\n\\- understand weights and attentions\n\n\\- learn back propagation and forward passes in neural networks\n\n\n\nThat would be real AI education. People who tell you to \"learn the tools\" are not promoting AI education. Be cautious, because they are imagining a skill gap. People who say \"learn the tool\". What comes next is \"I have a course\", \"I got 10 amazing prompts, low cost\", \"sign up to my workshop\", or \"devs in 2026 should be using this workflow\".\n\n\n\nAny halfway competent dev already know how to use claude code even if they haven 't already used it",

            "transcription": "Hi! Welcome to another video. So, if you have been using Moltbot, which was previously called Clawdbot, you probably noticed that it loses context way too often. Like, you set it up, you give it some instructions, and then the next day, it has no idea what you told it. It is a massive pain. However, there is a solution that completely fixes this, and it is called ByteRover. I have covered ByteRover before, but today I want to show you specifically how to set it up with Moltbot so that your AI assistant never loses context again. Now, let me talk about the problem first. When you run Moltbot on something like a Mac mini or a VPS, it runs 24/7. It handles scheduled tasks, responds to your messages on Discord or Slack, and basically acts like your personal AI employee. But the issue is that every time it hits context limits or starts a new session, it forgets everything. You have to re-explain what you are working on, your preferences, and all those little details that make your workflow smooth. This is extremely frustrating if you are trying to use it for serious work. ByteRover solves this by giving Moltbot a persistent memory layer. It stores your project knowledge, workflows, and preferences in what they call a context tree. And the best part is that it syncs across sessions. So, even if Moltbot restarts or hits its context limits, it can query ByteRover and get all that context back instantly. So, let's get right into it and set this up. First, you need to have Moltbot already running. If you do not have it installed yet, I have a full video on setting that up, which will be linked below. For this tutorial, I am assuming you already have Moltbot configured and working. Now, to add ByteRover, the setup is actually super simple with the new update. You do not need to mess with any MCP configuration or anything like that. First of all, you'd have to just get the ByteRover CLI installed with the NPM install command, and then you just need to install the ByteRover skill from ClawdHub. Go to your Moltbot interface and navigate to Skills. Then search for ByteRover and click Install. ClawdHub will handle everything for you automatically. Once the skill is installed, you just need to authenticate once. Just run the BRV command, then hit Tab and run the /login command to log into your account. If you do not have an account yet, it will help you create one. The free tier is quite generous, so you do not need to pay for anything to get started. After that is done, you will also need to go to the home ClawdBot directory, which is generally clawd folder in home directory, and then run the BRV command as well. This will start the ByteRover server. This needs to be running in order for ClawdBot to save memories. You can configure it as a startup app as well if you like restart your server quite often. If you are working in some new folder, then you'd have to ask ClawdBot to work in that. And you'd also need to go in and run the BRV command in that directory as well. Generally, if you're working directly without any specific directory, then initializing it in root clawd folder should work. And that is literally it. After you authenticate once, ClawdHub handles everything else. Moltbot now knows how to use all the ByteRover CLI commands on its own. You do not need to configure anything else or restart anything. It just works. You can test this by asking Moltbot to save something to memory. Type something like, \"Remember that I like my emails to be short and casual and I prefer bullet points. Use ByteRover.\" Moltbot will use ByteRover to store this information. You should see it confirm that the memory has been saved. Now, here is where it gets really useful. Let us say you restart Moltbot tomorrow or even a week from now. You can ask it something like, \"What are my email preferences?\" And it will query ByteRover and give you the answer. It remembers because the memory is stored in ByteRover's workspace, not in Moltbot's session context. But it does not stop there. ByteRover also has this Git-like workflow for memory management. If you are running Moltbot on multiple machines, like maybe a Mac mini at home and a VPS for work, you can sync memories between them. On one machine, run BRV push to send your local memories to the ByteRover cloud. On the other machine, run BRV pull to download them. Now both instances of Moltbot have access to the same context. This is pretty awesome if you work from multiple locations. One thing I really like about this setup is how it handles scheduled tasks. Let us say you ask Moltbot to ping you every morning at 9:00 AM with a summary of your project progress. Without ByteRover, Moltbot would have to re-read your entire project every time. With ByteRover, it already has that context stored. It can just query the relevant memories and give you a quick summary without wasting tokens or time. There are some issues you might run into though. The first one is that Moltbot sometimes does not know when to query memory versus when to just answer from its own knowledge. The ByteRover skill from ClawdHub actually handles this pretty well by default. But if you want to be extra sure, you can tell Moltbot something like, \"Always check ByteRover memory before answering questions about my work or preferences.\" This prompts it to query the memory layer first. Another issue is that memories can get stale. If you change what you are working on or update your preferences, the old memories are still there. ByteRover has a version history feature for this. You can go into the ByteRover dashboard and see all your memories with timestamps. If something is outdated, you can delete it or update it. When I am working, I can ask Moltbot to remember specific decisions. Like, \"Remember that my YouTube channel focuses on AI tools and tutorials and my target audience is beginners. Use ByteRover.\" Later, when I ask it to help me brainstorm video ideas, it already knows the context. No re-explaining needed. And if I ever need to wipe Moltbot and start fresh, my memories are safe in ByteRover. I just reinstall Moltbot, install the ByteRover skill from ClawdHub, authenticate once, and everything is back. It is really good peace of mind. The pricing is also reasonable. The free tier gives you enough memory storage for personal projects. If you are running a team or have a lot of context to store, their paid plans are pretty affordable. I think it is worth it if you are serious about using Moltbot for real work. ByteRover and Moltbot together make for a really powerful combination. You get the always-on availability of Moltbot with the persistent memory of ByteRover. If you have been frustrated with context loss, this is definitely worth trying. Overall, it is pretty cool. Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye!"

Great for casual automation. Not so great for actual engineering work. Enter Kilo for Slack. This is basically OpenClaw for real coding work. You mention it Kilo in any Slack thread, and it reads the entire conversation, connects to your GitHub repos, and either answers questions about your codebase, or straight up creates a branch, and submits a pull request. So imagine this... Product manager reports a bug. Engineers discuss the problem. Instead of someone copying all that context into their IDE, you just type it Kilo, fix the null pointer exception in the auth service based on this thread. And it does. It spins up a cloud agent, reads the context, implements the fix, and pushes a PR. All from Slack. The key difference? OpenClaw is model agnostic and general purpose. Kilo is laser focused on shipping code. It connects your Slack threads directly to GitHub Actions. One's a lobster doing tricks. The other is an engineering pipeline."

            "transcription": "Russia has posed existential threats to its neighbors forever. There are so many neighbors you have never heard of because they've disappeared from the pages of history, courtesy of the Russians. Let's go to the medieval period, where Russia starts out as the princely state of Muscovy, Moscow. Well, it wipes out the other princely states. There was Novgorod the Great, was the more progressive place. They wiped that place out. Pskov, Rostov, Tver. There are a lot of other places. And then later, they're eliminating the Khanates of Central Asia. These are states. The Khanate of Crimea, Kazan, Astrakhan, Kokand, Khiva, Bukhara. They get rid of all of it. And then there's been this repeated vivisecting of European neighbors, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Sweden, and Finland, of taking their territory one bite at a time. And you can see it going on today. And the Russians just don't see it, that if you do this to other people, this is why at the end of the Cold War, everyone is stampeding into NATO. It's not some conspiracy. It's just what the Russians have done to them."
