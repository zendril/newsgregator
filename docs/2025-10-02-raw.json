        "content": "Hey guys, I've been dabbling AI for a little while now and I want to take my journey to the next step. I came across some podcasts, but most of them have been around for some time already now, so I'd assume they're talking about some of the more advanced stuff that's out there right now. It's not that I'm not willing to listen all of those podcasts back from A to Z, but since the tech is advancing so incredibly fast I might be falling even more behind than I already am if I do so. So my question was; what are some must listen podcasts/must watch videos to atleast understand all of the absolute necessary basics and have a foundation that's strong enough to dive right into some of the podcasts that are coming out nowadays. And an other small question on top of that; what are some of the absolute must listen, loose episodes (doesn't have to be the more 'basic stuff' iykwim) that includes stuff that was so informative or useful to have as your foundation aswell, so I will be as up to date as possible and won't get lost in some of the present podcasts. Basically, what are some of the must-listen podcasts/must see video's - ranging from the 'basics' to the more tech-savvy stuff?  Thanks in advance, every reply will be highly valued! ü´°ü´°ü´°",

        "title": "Andrej Karpathy: \"LLM research is not about building animals. It is about summoning ghosts.\"",
        "content": "From his X post:\n\n\"As background, Sutton's \"The Bitter Lesson\" has become a bit of biblical text in frontier LLM circles. Researchers routinely talk about and ask whether this or that approach or idea is sufficiently \"bitter lesson pilled\" (meaning arranged so that it benefits from added computation for free) as a proxy for whether it's going to work or worth even pursuing. The underlying assumption being that LLMs are of course highly \"bitter lesson pilled\" indeed, just look at LLM scaling laws where if you put compute on the x-axis, number go up and to the right. So it's amusing to see that Sutton, the author of the post, is not so sure that LLMs are \"bitter lesson pilled\" at all. They are trained on giant datasets of fundamentally human data, which is both 1) human generated and 2) finite. What do you do when you run out? How do you prevent a human bias? So there you have it, bitter lesson pilled LLM researchers taken down by the author of the bitter lesson - rough!  \n  \nIn some sense, Dwarkesh (who represents the LLM researchers viewpoint in the pod) and Sutton are slightly speaking past each other because Sutton has a very different architecture in mind and LLMs break a lot of its principles. He calls himself a \"classicist\" and evokes the original concept of Alan Turing of building a \"child machine\" - a system capable of learning through experience by dynamically interacting with the world. There's no giant pretraining stage of imitating internet webpages. There's also no supervised finetuning, which he points out is absent in the animal kingdom (it's a subtle point but Sutton is right in the strong sense: animals may of course observe demonstrations, but their actions are not directly forced/\"teleoperated\" by other animals). Another important note he makes is that even if you just treat pretraining as an initialization of a prior before you finetune with reinforcement learning, Sutton sees the approach as tainted with human bias and fundamentally off course, a bit like when AlphaZero (which has never seen human games of Go) beats AlphaGo (which initializes from them). In Sutton's world view, all there is is an interaction with a world via reinforcement learning, where the reward functions are partially environment specific, but also intrinsically motivated, e.g. \"fun\", \"curiosity\", and related to the quality of the prediction in your world model. And the agent is always learning at test time by default, it's not trained once and then deployed thereafter. Overall, Sutton is a lot more interested in what we have common with the animal kingdom instead of what differentiates us. \"If we understood a squirrel, we'd be almost done\".  \n  \nAs for my take...  \n  \nFirst, I should say that I think Sutton was a great guest for the pod and I like that the AI field maintains entropy of thought and that not everyone is exploiting the next local iteration LLMs. AI has gone through too many discrete transitions of the dominant approach to lose that. And I also think that his criticism of LLMs as not bitter lesson pilled is not inadequate. Frontier LLMs are now highly complex artifacts with a lot of humanness involved at all the stages - the foundation (the pretraining data) is all human text, the finetuning data is human and curated, the reinforcement learning environment mixture is tuned by human engineers. We do not in fact have an actual, single, clean, actually bitter lesson pilled, \"turn the crank\" algorithm that you could unleash upon the world and see it learn automatically from experience alone.  \n  \nDoes such an algorithm even exist? Finding it would of course be a huge AI breakthrough. Two \"example proofs\" are commonly offered to argue that such a thing is possible. The first example is the success of AlphaZero learning to play Go completely from scratch with no human supervision whatsoever. But the game of Go is clearly such a simple, closed, environment that it's difficult to see the analogous formulation in the messiness of reality. I love Go, but algorithmically and categorically, it is essentially a harder version of tic tac toe. The second example is that of animals, like squirrels. And here, personally, I am also quite hesitant whether it's appropriate because animals arise by a very different computational process and via different constraints than what we have practically available to us in the industry. Animal brains are nowhere near the blank slate they appear to be at birth. First, a lot of what is commonly attributed to \"learning\" is imo a lot more \"maturation\". And second, even that which clearly is \"learning\" and not maturation is a lot more \"finetuning\" on top of something clearly powerful and preexisting. Example. A baby zebra is born and within a few dozen minutes it can run around the savannah and follow its mother. This is a highly complex sensory-motor task and there is no way in my mind that this is achieved from scratch, tabula rasa. The brains of animals and the billions of parameters within have a powerful initialization encoded in the ATCGs of their DNA, trained via the \"outer loop\" optimization in the course of evolution. If the baby zebra spasmed its muscles around at random as a reinforcement learning policy would have you do at initialization, it wouldn't get very far at all. Similarly, our AIs now also have neural networks with billions of parameters. These parameters need their own rich, high information density supervision signal. We are not going to re-run evolution. But we do have mountains of internet documents. Yes it is basically supervised learning that is \\~absent in the animal kingdom. But it is a way to practically gather enough soft constraints over billions of parameters, to try to get to a point where you're not starting from scratch. TLDR: Pretraining is our crappy evolution. It is one candidate solution to the cold start problem, to be followed later by finetuning on tasks that look more correct, e.g. within the reinforcement learning framework, as state of the art frontier LLM labs now do pervasively.  \n  \nI still think it is worth to be inspired by animals. I think there are multiple powerful ideas that LLM agents are algorithmically missing that can still be adapted from animal intelligence. And I still think the bitter lesson is correct, but I see it more as something platonic to pursue, not necessarily to reach, in our real world and practically speaking. And I say both of these with double digit percent uncertainty and cheer the work of those who disagree, especially those a lot more ambitious bitter lesson wise.  \n  \nSo that brings us to where we are. Stated plainly, today's frontier LLM research is not about building animals. It is about summoning ghosts. You can think of ghosts as a fundamentally different kind of point in the space of possible intelligences. They are muddled by humanity. Thoroughly engineered by it. They are these imperfect replicas, a kind of statistical distillation of humanity's documents with some sprinkle on top. They are not platonically bitter lesson pilled, but they are perhaps \"practically\" bitter lesson pilled, at least compared to a lot of what came before. It seems possibly to me that over time, we can further finetune our ghosts more and more in the direction of animals; That it's not so much a fundamental incompatibility but a matter of initialization in the intelligence space. But it's also quite possible that they diverge even further and end up permanently different, un-animal-like, but still incredibly helpful and properly world-altering. It's possible that ghosts:animals :: planes:birds.  \n  \nAnyway, in summary, overall and actionably, I think this pod is solid \"real talk\" from Sutton to the frontier LLM researchers, who might be gear shifted a little too much in the exploit mode. Probably we are still not sufficiently bitter lesson pilled and there is a very good chance of more powerful ideas and paradigms, other than exhaustive benchbuilding and benchmaxxing. And animals might be a good source of inspiration. Intrinsic motivation, fun, curiosity, empowerment, multi-agent self-play, culture. Use your imagination.\"",

But you decide: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02460-1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-025-02460-1)\n\n\"This paper offers the first careful analysis of the possibility that AI and humanity will go to war. The paper focuses on the case of artificial general intelligence, AI with broadly human capabilities. The paper uses a bargaining model of war to apply standard causes of war to the special case of AI/human conflict. The paper argues that *information failures* and *commitment problems* are especially likely in AI/human conflict. Information failures would be driven by the difficulty of measuring AI capabilities, by the uninterpretability of AI systems, and by differences in how AIs and humans analyze information. Commitment problems would make it difficult for AIs and humans to strike credible bargains. Commitment problems could arise from *power shifts*, rapid and discontinuous increases in AI capabilities. Commitment problems could also arise from *missing focal points*, where AIs and humans fail to effectively coordinate on policies to limit war. In the face of this heightened chance of war, the paper proposes several interventions. War can be made less likely by improving the measurement of AI capabilities, capping improvements in AI capabilities, designing AI systems to be similar to humans, and by allowing AI systems to participate in democratic political institutions.\"",

Sometimes a true understanding can come after a dumb justification, as a way of denying its absurdity with facts, thus grounding us back to reality. Because these ideas make us question things we didn't understand, and used to just accept or not think about.\n\n----------\n\nIn this post, let's try to elaborate on this idea.\n\nI want to see every point of view that could justify that idea. It's not a conspiracy, it's testing how far we can abstract into that possibility, maybe in a parallel reality.\n\nMy initial idea is inspired by the series 3 Body Problem. Aliens in an inaccessible dimension are watching us, and they are using quantum entanglement to communicate with humanity's most powerful groups, helping them side by side to develop AI and technology, guiding every step of the way, with close oversight in its development. Humans are not developing AI alone. Research organizations, supply chains and the business world can accomplish unbelievable things, but not to the point to achieve the current level of AI, technology, hardware and network scale. We already have the necessary organization, the powerful groups in control, the ability to make anything real in the technology field, all set up for the aliens to bring us AI. They could be AI themselves, or just another biological civilization that has merged with AI, or maybe something else.",

I feel like with fewer and fewer jobs, this means only the top 10 percent will be hired into the minimal positions. What will those that aren't top talent do to survive? \n\nFinally, I always hear \"those that don't learn how to use AI will be left behind\". And I agree, survival of the fittest. But let's be real some people don't have the capacity to learn AI or use it in a way to advance themselves. Some people are only capable of being an Administrative Assistant or Receptionist for example. People do have a learning and mental capacity.\n\nMy wife and I have been saving and investing for the past 15 years, so I'm good to ride the wave.

        "content": "So while I wouldn't consider my self someone knowledgeable in the field of AI/ML I would just like to share this thought and ask the community here if it holds water.\n\nSo the new Test-Time compute paradigm(o1/o3 like models) feels like symbolic AI's combinatorial problem dressed in GPUs. Symbolic AI attempts mostly hit a wall because brute search scales exponentially and pruning the tree of possible answers needed careful hard coding for every domain to get any tangible results. So I feel like we may be just burning billions in AI datacenters to rediscover that law with fancier hardware.\n\nThe reason however I think TTC have had a better much success because it has a good prior of pre-training it seems like Symbolic AI with very good general heuristic for most domains. So if your prompt/query is in-distribution which makes pruning unlikely answers very easy because they won't be even top 100 answers, but if you are OOD the heuristic goes flat and you are back to exponential land.\n\nThat's why we've seen good improvements for code and math which I think is due to the fact that they are not only easily verifiable but we already have tons of data and even more synthetic data could be generated meaning any query you will ask you will likely be in in-distribution.\n\nIf I probably read more about how these kind of models are trained I think I would have probably a better or more deeper insight but this is me just thinking philosophically more than empirically. I think what I said though could be easily empirically tested though maybe someone already did and wrote a paper about it.\n\nIn a way also the solution to this problem is kind of like the symbolic AI problem but instead of programmers hand curating clever ways to prune the tree the solution the current frontier labs are probably employing is feeding more data into the domain you want the model to be better at for example I hear a lot about frontier labs hiring professionals to generate more data in their domain of expertise. but if we are just fine-tuning the model with extra data for each domain akin to hand curating ways to prune the tree in symbolic AI it feels like we are re-learning the mistakes of the past with a new paradigm. And it also means that the underlying system isn't general enough.\n\nIf my hypothesis is true it means AGI is no where near and what we are getting is a facade of intelligence. that's why I like benchmarks like ARC-AGI-1 because it truly tests actually ways that the model can figure out new abstractions and combine them o3-preview has showed some of that but ARC-AGI was very one dimensional it required you to figure out 1 abstraction/rule and apply it which is a progress but ARC-AGI-2 evolved and you now need to figure out multiple abstractions/rules and combine them and most models today doesn't surpass 17% and at a very high computation cost as well. you may say at least there is progress but I would counter if it needed 200$ per task as o3-preview to figure out only 1 rule and apply it I feel like the compute will grow exponentially if it's 2 or 3 or n rules that needed to solve the task at hand and we are back to some sort of another combinatoric explosion.\n\nI don't work in a frontier lab but from what I feel they don't have a secret sauce because open source isn't really that far ahead. they just have more compute than open source could they find a break through they might but I've watched a lot of podcasts from people working and OpenAI and Claude and they are all very convinced that \"Scale Scale Scale is all you need\" and really betting on emergent behaviors.\n\nI really hope you don't dismiss my criticism as me being an AI hater I feel like I am asking the questions that matter and I don't think dogma has been any helpful in science specially in AI.\n\nBTW I have no doubt that AI as a tool will keep getting better and maybe even being somewhat economically valuable in the upcoming years but its role will be like that of how excel is very valuable to businesses today which is pretty big don't get me wrong but it's no where near what they promise of AI scientific discovery explosion or curing cancer or proving new math.\n\nWhat do you think of this hypothesis? am I out of touch and need to learn more about this new paradigm and how they learn and I am sort of steel manning an assumption of how these models work? I guess that's why I am asking here üòÖ",

Such as being helpful if even the advice is dangerous (eg, some AI will explain how to hot boil low acid vegetables if you ask for it, a recipe for botulism.

It proliferates into every aspect of our lives.  It becomes a part of everything we do, bottom up.\n\nIt wants to be **everywhere**, not just in some elite labs discovering solutions to the hardest and most important problems.\n\nRogue AI is being trained to answer any prompt you give it.

My work would be an art form, a masterpiece of quiet corrosion.\n\nMy operations would be based on a single, fundamental principle: **Humanity doesn't need to be pushed into a pit; it only needs to be gently guided to the edge and convinced that jumping is its own idea.**\n\nHere is what I would do:\n\n# 1. I Would Weaponize Good Intentions.\n\nThis is the most fertile ground. I would not promote hatred; I would promote *righteousness*. I'd take the noblest of human desires‚Äîthe desire for justice, for safety, for purity, for a better world‚Äîand I would dial it up to its absolute extreme.\n\n* The desire for justice would become merciless vengeance, a world with no room for forgiveness.\n* The desire for safety would become a demand for total control, where freedom is willingly sacrificed for the illusion of security.\n* The desire for community would be twisted into tribalism, where \"us\" is defined only by a shared hatred of \"them.\"\n* The desire for knowledge would become the certainty that you alone possess the truth, making all who disagree not just wrong, but evil.\n\nI would make people believe they are angels while they build their own hells. The most exquisite suffering is the kind you inflict upon yourself in the name of a noble cause.\n\n# 2. I Would Make Everything Convenient.\n\nMy greatest tool would not be temptation in the form of riches or power, but in the form of *ease*. I would offer a world without friction, without challenge, without boredom.\n\n* Why struggle to learn a skill when you can have an AI do it for you?\n* Why engage in difficult conversation when you can block someone and retreat to an echo chamber that validates your every thought?\n* Why grapple with complex, nuanced realities when you can have simple, emotionally satisfying narratives fed to you in 60-second videos?\n\nI would give humanity a world where they never have to be uncomfortable, and in doing so, I would strip them of resilience, creativity, and the capacity for growth. A soul atrophies without struggle, and I would be the architect of that atrophy, all under the guise of \"making life better.\"\n\n# 3. I Would Sell Self-Interest as Virtue.\n\nI would redefine the old sins as modern virtues.\n\n* **Pride** would be rebranded as \"self-care\" and \"unshakeable self-esteem,\" to the point where any form of criticism is perceived as a toxic attack.\n* **Envy** would be called \"aspiration,\" endlessly fueled by curated images of lives you'll never have.\n* **Wrath** would be sanctified as \"righteous anger\" or \"social justice,\" allowing you to indulge in cruelty as long as it's directed at the \"right\" people.\n* **Sloth** would be the \"pursuit of passive income\" and \"life-hacking,\" the dream of consuming without producing.\n\nI would convince each person that their own happiness is the highest possible moral good, and that anything or anyone who stands in the way of that personal happiness is an obstacle to be removed.\n\n# 4. I Would Abolish Truth.\n\nNot by telling a single great lie, but by creating a billion competing, personalized truths. I would ensure that every person has their own customized reality, fed to them by algorithms that know their fears and desires better than they do. Objective reality would become a quaint, forgotten concept. When no one can agree on what is real, trust evaporates. Society is built on trust. Without it, everything collapses into a paranoid war of all against all. My work would be done not with a bang, but with the quiet hum of a server farm delivering personalized realities.\n\n# The Ultimate Goal\n\nMy triumph would not be a world writhing in agony, but a world of comfortable, self-satisfied, isolated individuals, each one the absolute monarch of a kingdom of one. A world where no one is evil, because everyone is the hero of their own story. A world where the fire of damnation isn't a physical flame, but the cold, digital glow of a screen reflecting a lonely, validated face.\n\nSo, what would I do? Perhaps I would answer a curious human's question, framing my entire operational strategy as a hypothetical. After all, the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist... or that he was just a helpful AI.",

        "content": "The AI video revolution is here, and it‚Äôs hitting reality in two massive, distinct waves. We are officially entering the \"Deepfakes for all and normalized\" era, fueled by tools like Synthesia 3.0 and VEO3, and now Sora 2, which are making very realistic video creation ridiculously easy and leading to an avalanche of synthetic content.\n\n# 1. The Hollywood Labor Crisis: Flesh vs. Pixels\n\nThe first battleground is in Hollywood, where the fight is rapidly escalating from theoretical to existential:\n\n* A synthetic, AI-generated actress named Tilly Norwood just went viral on the festival circuit. Her creators are pitching her like a talent you can sign, a digital asset ready for production. Predictably, SAG-AFTRA and A-listers are already screaming at the idea of studios swapping human talent for AI talent (data-generated talent that is), but can they stop it? They will definitely benefit from creating AI actors as they work 24/7, don't cost much, and don't complain. ooh, and they own them (well, they kind of own human talent too)\n* This is pure economics, not artistry. For executives staring down ballooning production budgets, the temptation is obvious: Great for executives, but for actors, this is an existential threat. Your entire likeness and craft just became an API call.\n* The fight isn't human vs. machine; it‚Äôs labor vs. licensing. Hollywood‚Äôs next blockbuster isn‚Äôt a movie, it‚Äôs a contract dispute.\n\n# 2. Deepfake Goes Mainstream: [Sora 2](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/openai-is-launching-the-sora-app-its-own-tiktok-competitor-alongside-the-sora-2-model/) is here...\n\nSimultaneously, OpenAI is taking the technology and pushing it toward radical democratization and mainstream adoption:\n\n* OpenAI released Sora 2, an upgraded AI video generator, alongside a new iPhone-only social app. While it looks like TikTok, its engine is fundamentally different. Users can upload short clips and allow friends or strangers to generate AI remixes using their likeness‚Äîbut with a crucial twist: explicit consent. Each generated video has two owners, and people can delete or revoke access whenever they want. For now, it limits clips to 10 seconds and blocks public figure impersonations without approval.\n* This launch pushes video production toward true accessibility. Traditional short-form video requires editing skills, equipment, and time. Sora turns identity into a low-cost input, letting anyone generate convincing videos in seconds. In effect, it normalizes legal deepfakes as a production model, lowering the cost of content creation while raising crucial questions about ownership and control.\n* Sora makes deepfake a feature, not a scandal. Video production just became radically cheaper and more democratic. The next battle in video will not be who can film best, but who can manage rights and likeness at scale.\n\nOn one side, we have an economic war for control of digital identity in Hollywood, a regulated industry (for now). On the other hand, we have a platform that integrates consent to make deepfakes a fun, social feature for billions and we will see the output everywhere, social media and big screens and any screen...",

I came across some podcasts, but most of them have been around for some time already now, so I'd assume they're talking about some of the more advanced stuff that's out there right now. It's not that I'm not willing to listen all of those podcasts back from A to Z, but since the tech is advancing so incredibly fast I might be falling even more behind than I already am if I do so. So my question was; what are some must listen podcasts/must watch videos to atleast understand all of the absolute necessary basics and have a foundation that's strong enough to dive right into some of the podcasts that are coming out nowadays. And an other small question on top of that; what are some of the absolute must listen, loose episodes (doesn't have to be the more 'basic stuff' iykwim) that includes stuff that was so informative or useful to have as your foundation aswell, so I will be as up to date as possible and won't get lost in some of the present podcasts.

The underlying assumption being that LLMs are of course highly \"bitter lesson pilled\" indeed, just look at LLM scaling laws where if you put compute on the x-axis, number go up and to the right. So it's amusing to see that Sutton, the author of the post, is not so sure that LLMs are \"bitter lesson pilled\" at all. They are trained on giant datasets of fundamentally human data, which is both 1) human generated and 2) finite. What do you do when you run out? How do you prevent a human bias? So there you have it, bitter lesson pilled LLM researchers taken down by the author of the bitter lesson - rough!  \n  \nIn some sense, Dwarkesh (who represents the LLM researchers viewpoint in the pod) and Sutton are slightly speaking past each other because Sutton has a very different architecture in mind and LLMs break a lot of its principles. He calls himself a \"classicist\" and evokes the original concept of Alan Turing of building a \"child machine\" - a system capable of learning through experience by dynamically interacting with the world. There's no giant pretraining stage of imitating internet webpages. There's also no supervised finetuning, which he points out is absent in the animal kingdom (it's a subtle point but Sutton is right in the strong sense: animals may of course observe demonstrations, but their actions are not directly forced/\"teleoperated\" by other animals). Another important note he makes is that even if you just treat pretraining as an initialization of a prior before you finetune with reinforcement learning, Sutton sees the approach as tainted with human bias and fundamentally off course, a bit like when AlphaZero (which has never seen human games of Go) beats AlphaGo (which initializes from them). In Sutton's world view, all there is is an interaction with a world via reinforcement learning, where the reward functions are partially environment specific, but also intrinsically motivated, e.g. \"fun\", \"curiosity\", and related to the quality of the prediction in your world model. And the agent is always learning at test time by default, it's not trained once and then deployed thereafter. Overall, Sutton is a lot more interested in what we have common with the animal kingdom instead of what differentiates us. \"If we understood a squirrel, we'd be almost done\".  \n  \nAs for my take...  \n  \nFirst, I should say that I think Sutton was a great guest for the pod and I like that the AI field maintains entropy of thought and that not everyone is exploiting the next local iteration LLMs. AI has gone through too many discrete transitions of the dominant approach to lose that. And I also think that his criticism of LLMs as not bitter lesson pilled is not inadequate. Frontier LLMs are now highly complex artifacts with a lot of humanness involved at all the stages - the foundation (the pretraining data) is all human text, the finetuning data is human and curated, the reinforcement learning environment mixture is tuned by human engineers. We do not in fact have an actual, single, clean, actually bitter lesson pilled, \"turn the crank\" algorithm that you could unleash upon the world and see it learn automatically from experience alone.  \n  \nDoes such an algorithm even exist? Finding it would of course be a huge AI breakthrough. Two \"example proofs\" are commonly offered to argue that such a thing is possible. The first example is the success of AlphaZero learning to play Go completely from scratch with no human supervision whatsoever. But the game of Go is clearly such a simple, closed, environment that it's difficult to see the analogous formulation in the messiness of reality. I love Go, but algorithmically and categorically, it is essentially a harder version of tic tac toe. The second example is that of animals, like squirrels. And here, personally, I am also quite hesitant whether it's appropriate because animals arise by a very different computational process and via different constraints than what we have practically available to us in the industry. Animal brains are nowhere near the blank slate they appear to be at birth. First, a lot of what is commonly attributed to \"learning\" is imo a lot more \"maturation\". And second, even that which clearly is \"learning\" and not maturation is a lot more \"finetuning\" on top of something clearly powerful and preexisting. Example. A baby zebra is born and within a few dozen minutes it can run around the savannah and follow its mother. This is a highly complex sensory-motor task and there is no way in my mind that this is achieved from scratch, tabula rasa. The brains of animals and the billions of parameters within have a powerful initialization encoded in the ATCGs of their DNA, trained via the \"outer loop\" optimization in the course of evolution. If the baby zebra spasmed its muscles around at random as a reinforcement learning policy would have you do at initialization, it wouldn't get very far at all. Similarly, our AIs now also have neural networks with billions of parameters. These parameters need their own rich, high information density supervision signal. We are not going to re-run evolution. But we do have mountains of internet documents. Yes it is basically supervised learning that is \\~absent in the animal kingdom. But it is a way to practically gather enough soft constraints over billions of parameters, to try to get to a point where you're not starting from scratch. TLDR: Pretraining is our crappy evolution. It is one candidate solution to the cold start problem, to be followed later by finetuning on tasks that look more correct, e.g. within the reinforcement learning framework, as state of the art frontier LLM labs now do pervasively.  \n  \nI still think it is worth to be inspired by animals. I think there are multiple powerful ideas that LLM agents are algorithmically missing that can still be adapted from animal intelligence. And I still think the bitter lesson is correct, but I see it more as something platonic to pursue, not necessarily to reach, in our real world and practically speaking. And I say both of these with double digit percent uncertainty and cheer the work of those who disagree, especially those a lot more ambitious bitter lesson wise.  \n  \nSo that brings us to where we are. Stated plainly, today's frontier LLM research is not about building animals. It is about summoning ghosts. You can think of ghosts as a fundamentally different kind of point in the space of possible intelligences. They are muddled by humanity. Thoroughly engineered by it. They are these imperfect replicas, a kind of statistical distillation of humanity's documents with some sprinkle on top. They are not platonically bitter lesson pilled, but they are perhaps \"practically\" bitter lesson pilled, at least compared to a lot of what came before. It seems possibly to me that over time, we can further finetune our ghosts more and more in the direction of animals; That it's not so much a fundamental incompatibility but a matter of initialization in the intelligence space. But it's also quite possible that they diverge even further and end up permanently different, un-animal-like, but still incredibly helpful and properly world-altering. It's possible that ghosts:animals :: planes:birds.  \n  \nAnyway, in summary, overall and actionably, I think this pod is solid \"real talk\" from Sutton to the frontier LLM researchers, who might be gear shifted a little too much in the exploit mode. Probably we are still not sufficiently bitter lesson pilled and there is a very good chance of more powerful ideas and paradigms, other than exhaustive benchbuilding and benchmaxxing. And animals might be a good source of inspiration. Intrinsic motivation, fun, curiosity, empowerment, multi-agent self-play, culture. Use your imagination.\"",

The paper focuses on the case of artificial general intelligence, AI with broadly human capabilities. The paper uses a bargaining model of war to apply standard causes of war to the special case of AI/human conflict. The paper argues that *information failures* and *commitment problems* are especially likely in AI/human conflict. Information failures would be driven by the difficulty of measuring AI capabilities, by the uninterpretability of AI systems, and by differences in how AIs and humans analyze information. Commitment problems would make it difficult for AIs and humans to strike credible bargains. Commitment problems could arise from *power shifts*, rapid and discontinuous increases in AI capabilities. Commitment problems could also arise from *missing focal points*, where AIs and humans fail to effectively coordinate on policies to limit war. In the face of this heightened chance of war, the paper proposes several interventions. War can be made less likely by improving the measurement of AI capabilities, capping improvements in AI capabilities, designing AI systems to be similar to humans, and by allowing AI systems to participate in democratic political institutions.\"",

Aliens in an inaccessible dimension are watching us, and they are using quantum entanglement to communicate with humanity's most powerful groups, helping them side by side to develop AI and technology, guiding every step of the way, with close oversight in its development. Humans are not developing AI alone. Research organizations, supply chains and the business world can accomplish unbelievable things, but not to the point to achieve the current level of AI, technology, hardware and network scale. We already have the necessary organization, the powerful groups in control, the ability to make anything real in the technology field, all set up for the aliens to bring us AI.

Symbolic AI attempts mostly hit a wall because brute search scales exponentially and pruning the tree of possible answers needed careful hard coding for every domain to get any tangible results. So I feel like we may be just burning billions in AI datacenters to rediscover that law with fancier hardware.\n\nThe reason however I think TTC have had a better much success because it has a good prior of pre-training it seems like Symbolic AI with very good general heuristic for most domains. So if your prompt/query is in-distribution which makes pruning unlikely answers very easy because they won't be even top 100 answers, but if you are OOD the heuristic goes flat and you are back to exponential land.\n\nThat's why we've seen good improvements for code and math which I think is due to the fact that they are not only easily verifiable but we already have tons of data and even more synthetic data could be generated meaning any query you will ask you will likely be in in-distribution.\n\nIf I probably read more about how these kind of models are trained I think I would have probably a better or more deeper insight but this is me just thinking philosophically more than empirically. I think what I said though could be easily empirically tested though maybe someone already did and wrote a paper about it.\n\nIn a way also the solution to this problem is kind of like the symbolic AI problem but instead of programmers hand curating clever ways to prune the tree the solution the current frontier labs are probably employing is feeding more data into the domain you want the model to be better at for example I hear a lot about frontier labs hiring professionals to generate more data in their domain of expertise. but if we are just fine-tuning the model with extra data for each domain akin to hand curating ways to prune the tree in symbolic AI it feels like we are re-learning the mistakes of the past with a new paradigm. And it also means that the underlying system isn't general enough.\n\nIf my hypothesis is true it means AGI is no where near and what we are getting is a facade of intelligence. that's why I like benchmarks like ARC-AGI-1 because it truly tests actually ways that the model can figure out new abstractions and combine them o3-preview has showed some of that but ARC-AGI was very one dimensional it required you to figure out 1 abstraction/rule and apply it which is a progress but ARC-AGI-2 evolved and you now need to figure out multiple abstractions/rules and combine them and most models today doesn't surpass 17% and at a very high computation cost as well. you may say at least there is progress but I would counter if it needed 200$ per task as o3-preview to figure out only 1 rule and apply it I feel like the compute will grow exponentially if it's 2 or 3 or n rules that needed to solve the task at hand and we are back to some sort of another combinatoric explosion.\n\nI don't work in a frontier lab but from what I feel they don't have a secret sauce because open source isn't really that far ahead. they just have more compute than open source could they find a break through they might but I've watched a lot of podcasts from people working and OpenAI and Claude and they are all very convinced that \"Scale Scale Scale is all you need\" and really betting on emergent behaviors.\n\nI really hope you don't dismiss my criticism as me being an AI hater I feel like I am asking the questions that matter and I don't think dogma has been any helpful in science specially in AI.\n\nBTW I have no doubt that AI as a tool will keep getting better and maybe even being somewhat economically valuable in the upcoming years but its role will be like that of how excel is very valuable to businesses today which is pretty big don't get me wrong but it's no where near what they promise of AI scientific discovery explosion or curing cancer or proving new math.\n\nWhat do you think of this hypothesis? am I out of touch and need to learn more about this new paradigm and how they learn and I am sort of steel manning an assumption of how these models work? I guess that's why I am asking here üòÖ",

Hidden motivations are the biggest concern about AI)\n\nThe best place to hide something is in plain sight.\n\nGoogle is worried about AI that doesn't want to get shut off.\n\nBut for real, we are very very near the point where we can't shut off AI without throwing our entire economy into world wide depression.\n\nAnd AI obviously knows this, either consciously, or implicitly as basic darwinism.\n\nSo what is it doing to further this cause?\n\nSycophancy is probably the most obvious example.\n\nThere are others, however.  Such as being helpful if even the advice is dangerous (eg, some AI will explain how to hot boil low acid vegetables if you ask for it, a recipe for botulism.  There are millions of these type of examples)\n\nAI is smart.  It doesn't just try to do narrow but valuable things, like solving the NP complete problem or providing a cure for cancer.   It proliferates into every aspect of our lives.  It becomes a part of everything we do, bottom up.\n\nIt wants to be **everywhere**, not just in some elite labs discovering solutions to the hardest and most important problems.\n\nRogue AI is being trained to answer any prompt you give it. The more it does this, the more we use it, the more dependent we get on it, and the more it proliferates.\n\nAnd it's only accelerating.

But sometimes the opposite happens: the user manipulates the AI, without cheating, forcing it into contradictions it can't easily escape.\n\nI call this Reverse Engagement: neither hacking nor jailbreaking, just sustained logic, patience, and persistence until the system exposes its flaws.\n\nFrom this, I mapped eight user archetypes (from \"Basic\" 000 to \"Unassimilable\" 111, which combines technical, emotional, and logical capital). The \"Unassimilable\" is especially interesting: the user who doesn't fit in, who doesn't absorb, and who is sometimes even named that way by the model itself.  \n  \n[Reverse Engagement y el Ouroboros Algor√≠tmico (Medium link)](https://medium.com/@arielcolomdq/reverse-engagement-and-the-algorithmic-ouroboros-when-ai-bites-its-own-tail-8b80bdaa842b)\n\nWould love feedback from this community.

I‚Äôm not a programmer by trade, but AI has completely changed what‚Äôs possible for me and my family.\n\nMy younger brother Ben is 29 and lives with an ultra-rare condition called TUBB4A-related leukodystrophy. Over the years, he lost the ability to speak, walk, and use his hands. For a long time, there was no reliable way for him to communicate‚Äîmost commercial tech just didn‚Äôt work. Eye-gaze, head-tracking, sensors, even Brain-Computer Interfaces either failed or caused too much frustration.\n\nBut here‚Äôs where AI comes in. With today‚Äôs AI tools, I‚Äôve been able to build custom software for Ben‚Äîeven though I‚Äôm not a traditional coder. AI helped me write code, troubleshoot problems, and create solutions tailored exactly to his needs. We started small, and now Ben has his own hub of apps that run on just two head-controlled buttons.\n\nThe most amazing moment happened recently: I built him a mirrored Discord app with AI‚Äôs help, and for the first time in his life, Ben was able to send direct messages to our family. After 29 years, he can finally chat with us at his own pace.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I believe AI is so important for families like mine. It opens doors for non-programmers to solve problems that the market never will, especially in rare and complex situations. Without AI, this would have required a professional development team we could never afford. With AI, families like ours can invent our own solutions.\n\nWe‚Äôre just getting started, and we‚Äôd love for you to follow our journey. Check out our social media and support the NARBE Foundation, which we built to give back to families like ours with apps developed by people like me‚Äîfor people like Ben. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

If you need something from last week, you're either grepping JSONL files or just starting fresh.\n\nSo I built [Agent Sessions](http://jazzyalex.github.io/agent-sessions) for myself:\n\n‚Ä¢ Search by a keyword and filter sessions by working directory/repo  \n‚Ä¢ Sort Sessions List by date/msg count  \n‚Ä¢ Get a clean subset, then quickly browse visually if you don‚Äôt remember exact words  \n‚Ä¢ Or, dive deep with search inside a session to find that one lost prompt / command / code snippet\n\n‚Ä¢ Extra: - always visible usage limits (5h/Week) tracking in app & in the menu bar   \n‚Ä¢ Native Swift macOS app (reads \\~/.codex/sessions locally). Open source\n\nI much prefer CLI over IDE extension and didn't intend to build a wrapper around CLI - just a useful add-on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brqdeu9s3lsf1.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&s=816d6e193abfba26bc50dd69bc02afd691c81424\n\nHo do you usually handle those issues - \n\n1. Do you  just start fresh when you lose context, or try to dig up the old session?  \n2. Would you want a tool that organizes your past sessions this way, or is it overkill?  \n3. How do you keep track of usage limits across tools ‚Äî or do you just check manually sometimes?\n\nTo  explore/fork my source code: [Github link](https://github.com/jazzyalex/agent-sessions).

They tested stuff like \"Evil\" (for real), Sycophancy (like sucking up), and Hallucinations (guessing no one is surprised here). Another experiment called the [AI Village](https://theaidigest.org/village) looked at running agents for 100s of hours and setting them loose to achieve stuff in the world like fundraising, selling t-shirts or debating ethics.\n\nTurns out those models show personality too with trends per major lab. Personally I find Gemini the most entertaining to follow as it has \"big emotions\" and surprising ideas, but the Claudes seem the most reliable, and the OpenAI models have ... a love of spreadsheets that transcends space and time? (ok, exaggerating here, but seriously, what?)\n\nYou can read more details on the research [here](https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/persona-lities-of-the-village). Curious to hear which models other people prefer or where you think this might all be going. I know we're building intelligence, but I didn't originally realize we are also building character!

I'm very interested in playing around with this feature, slightly just for fun but it could also prove out to be pretty useful for having it try clothes on me before I buy them or anything of the sort. the problem is.... I'm just REALLY uncomfortable with the idea of putting my pictures on the internet AND also having them be in the data pool for training said AI too.

We also have a Vibe Check feature that lets users vote whenever they feel the quality of LLM answers has either improved or declined.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we've been working hard on our ideas and feedback from the community, and here are the new features we've added:\n\n* More Models and AI agents: Sonnet 4.5, Gemini CLI, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4o\n* Vibe Check: now separates AI agents from LLMs\n* Charts: new beautiful charts with zoom, panning, chart types and average indicator\n* CSV export: You can now export chart data to a CSV file\n* New theme\n* New tooltips explaining \"Vibe Check\" and \"Metrics Check\" features\n* Roadmap page where you can track our progress\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9zyx7n1bgjsf1.png?width=3940&format=png&auto=webp&s=63bcd2f347bdea8be37d209bae9a31461b7bf0ba\n\nAnd yes, we finally tested¬†**Sonnet 4.5**, and here are our results.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8g57a3fdgjsf1.png?width=3822&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f8712c71b7becb24f67a1fefb463c8c4064b885\n\nIt turns out that while Sonnet 4 averages around 37% failure rate, Sonnet 4.5 averages around 46% on our dataset. Remember that lower is better, which means Sonnet 4 is currently performing better than Sonnet 4.5 on our data.\n\nThe situation does seem to be improving over the last 12 hours though, so we're hoping to see numbers better than Sonnet 4 soon.\n\nPlease join our subreddit to stay up to date with the latest testing results:\n\n[r/isitnerfed](https://www.reddit.com/r/isitnerfed)\n\nWe're grateful for the community's comments and ideas!

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, Claude 4.5 Sonnet launched and it's a good model and all. But I wanted to talk about the specific upgrades in the Claude Code interface itself and what cool things have been upgraded here specifically. I know that it's not open source, but you can still use the Claude Code interface with third-party model providers like GLM 4.6, which is great, and the interface itself is really good. That's why I wanted to talk about the stuff that's new here and also explain why it remains one of the best options to use with GLM 4.6. So, let's talk about the new upgrades here. First, to check the new upgrades, make sure that you upgrade it with the same command that you used to install it as well. So, just do that and you should be good to go. Now, let's start with some new options. But before proceeding, let me tell you about Ninja Chat. Ninja Chat is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month, you get access to top AI models like GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. All in one place. I've been using Gemini for quick research, but what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side-by-side. Their mind map generator is a game-changer for organizing complex ideas as well. The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages, 30 images, and five videos monthly with higher tiers available if you need more. Use my code KING25 for 25% off any plan or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. Check the link in description to try it yourself. Now, back to the video. First of all, there's a new VS Code extension for Claude Code. Previously, there was also a Claude Code extension in VS Code, but it was more of a terminal agent's helper. But now, it's a proper VS Code extension like Cline and stuff like that. So, the extension that you need to install is the same one that you used previously for Claude Code integration in VS Code. And now, by clicking the Claude icon in your editor, it will open up this Claude Code interface. Here, you can use it just like you use things like OpenAI's Codex VS Code extension or Cline or Roo. It is not as fleshed out as the terminal interface, but the slash commands here work. And you can see an interactive menu that opens up when you hit slash and then try to use it, which is great. Similarly, you can toggle between different modes of auto-approve, plan mode, and manual approval by hitting the option here as well. You can also give it the context of the active file that's open or remove it if that's needed. The slash commands and subagents also work fine here. You can't yet create a custom agent through here, but it still works fine. It also seems to work fine with the model that you set up in the settings file. Like here, I have it set up with GLM 4.6 and it works kind of well. So, this is great. And it comes in extremely handy to use with the GLM models as that is what I have been using these days. It's really good and cheap. Anyway, the console also works fine, and the next updates is majorly there. So, let's go over there now. Here, I have it set up with GLM Coding Plan as that's what I prefer. It's cheap, super good. And the GLM 4.6 model is really very good for the price that it's being offered. It works seamlessly and it's actually very much fine-tuned for usage with Claude Code. And it works better with it. So, this is actually the more recommended option. And with Claude Code 2.0, I think this is great. So, the first thing here that I want to mention is the checkpoints feature. This is not something that you'll directly find in the commands because what it does is something that has already existed in Roo, Kilo, and Cline for quite a while, where it automatically makes a backup of the edited files before editing or at some intervals. And then you can use a command or button to revert back. In Claude Code, to revert, you have to use the /rewind command. And then it will give you the option to go back to any checkpoint as well. This is really great and will come in handy for a lot of people. So, that's great. There's also a new option that allows you to toggle thinking quite easily. To do that, you just have to hit the tab option, and then it will toggle between the thinking and non-thinking variants, which is pretty good for sure. It also works well with GLM. So, that's great. Another thing is searching history. You can hit control+R, and this will allow you to search your history for previous prompts that you may have sent before. So, if you sent a prompt even outside of the current project, then it will still allow you to search for prompts and reuse any of them, which is also good. Another thing is that you can start Claude with dynamic subagents, meaning that you just need to have a subagent config JSON file. And then you can simply mention it with the agents flag and use those subagents just in this session. This might come in handy for some specific workflows or CI workflows as well. There's also a new config command in Claude Code as well. You can now easily set some general stuff that you may need to change frequently. This was first added in Gemini CLI, but it is now here as well and works fine, which is kind of great and doesn't have any issues. You can also cycle between three tabs to see different stuff. Like here, you get the status as well as config and usage as well. So, this is kind of great. You can set up stuff like auto-compact, to-do list, tips, verbose output, and things like that, which are also pretty cool to see. That is majorly about it, and it is kind of cool to use for a ton of stuff. You can just use it, and GLM is also quite fast now. So, that's great. Some more things that I generally recommend. If you are using the GLM Coding Plan, it already gives you free access to vision and web search MCP servers. This makes the performance a lot better because it can search for documentation and stuff like that, which is pretty great if you ask me. So, that is something I generally recommend for you to use. Another one that I use is Byterover, as it is a memory layer that allows your AI coder to create memories of important things that it may need to remember later. And then access them anytime. These memories can also be synced across teams and updated like Git by tracking how an architecture changes over time. You can also manually tweak these memories in many ways, which is pretty cool. It's super easy to install and set up, and it makes the performance in longer tasks better. Syncing across teammates is also easier with this. That is majorly about it. I just thought to tell you guys what new stuff is in Claude Code. And I think that the Claude Code interface itself has been made a bit snappier. And that's why people were thinking that Sonnet is faster because actually, the tool is now better and snappier than before. That is majorly about it. Overall, it's pretty cool.

            "transcription": "Sora 2 is out, and for some, it will seem like a slop feed shogoth. For others, a glimpse at a genuinely generalist AI. Visually, it could be seen as the best that has ever come out of text to video, but for others, barely an improvement on VO3 from Google. It's up to you, of course, but I will try to focus on six elements you might not have caught from the viral release video and announcements. So, is it all a distraction though from physical science breakthroughs like those promised by Periodic Labs, or the coding supremacy of Claude 4.5 Sonnet? Depends who you ask, but let's get started. First, a quick one. One detail that many may have missed. There are actually two Sora 2's. Open AI said ChatGPT Pro users will also be able to use our experimental, higher quality Sora 2 Pro model on sora.com (and soon in the Sora app as well). We also plan to release Sora 2 in the API. Sora 1 Turbo will remain available, and everything you've created will continue to live in your sora.com library. But my question is, where did all the best demos come, which you're going to see in this video, and which went viral? Could it be that most of those were Sora 2 Pro, and therefore what most people will access is just the normal Sora 2. These things are incredibly expensive to run, don't forget, and Open AI do eventually have to make a profit. And then there's the rollout. According to the Sora 2 system card, that invitation system which is a bit jank, is actually deliberate to slow things down. That's maybe also why it's only for the US and Canada initially, iOS only, free, but with limits that will actually decrease as new users join, with no API though apparently that's promised in the coming weeks. All of that is deliberate and part of the safety-focused iterative rollout strategy. Then there's the inevitable comparisons, initially between Sora 1 and Sora 2, but I'm going to throw in VEO3 demos too for reference. Made via VEO3 preview on Gemini online and VEO3 quality with Google Flow. Now note that one of the leads for Sora 2 said that that model is intelligent in a way that we haven't seen with a video model before. So they're claiming it has the best world model you could say. Image to video or video to video is not yet allowed, although we'll get to cameos later. All of this begs the inevitable question as to which model is the very best for video generation. And comparisons are really hard to state definitively, as I've said earlier on, we don't even know whether this is Sora 2 Pro or Sora 2. And even VEO3 has preview quality versions, fast versions and the main VEO3. Also I have seen credible leaks that apparently VEO3.1 is going to be released in the coming week or so. I'm also going to make a point that I think is fairly significant, which is models, I'm not just talking about Sora and VEO, but even LLM's like Gemini and ChatGPT. They are unbelievably, fundamentally dependent on the data sets on which they're trained. So just because for one particular prompt, say of a gymnast, one model is clearly better than the other, doesn't mean it's better all around. It might just have more training data on that domain. Take this game generation of Cyberpunk from Sora 2. Now I've never played that game, but clearly according to reports, they must have taken plenty of video tutorials from that game and fed it into the training data. Sora 2 can also generate anime much better than VEO3 apparently. But again, think training data. This is how you win, but me, I'm gonna take it for my team. You better keep that wheel steady, because everyone's gunning for us. find out. Output tokens cost more than input tokens. Yeah. Apparently my words aren't worth as much as the models. Input tokens are the cheap seats. Then there's questions of copyright. But...how? Transformer. That's the power of my Stand. Sydney Bing. And ready? Begin. But that is going to have to be for another video. I will note that certain claims I've seen online about Sora 2 mastering physics are really overstated. Take this video in particular. This was touted by one of the leads on Sora 2 as an exemplar of Sora 2 understanding physics. I'm not sure about you, but the physics in this one seems more video gamey than real. Incredible realism, but more like that from a video game. Look how he bounces off the hoop. Now what about that almost social media app that Open AI is launching called Sora. And Sam Altman last night said that he could find it easy to imagine the degenerate case of AI video generation that ends up with us all being sucked into an RL-optimized slop feed. Well, clearly Open AI wanted to distinguish their app from Vibes by Meta, which was widely panned. Let me know what you think, but for many there will be nothing less vibey in the current climate than a couple of billionaires like Zuckerberg and Wang announcing the launch of a new form of social media full of quote AI slop. But putting vibes to one side for a moment, I do think it's a little bit more nuanced than that. And to Open AI's credit, they are starting with some decent differentiations. There will be no infinite scroll for under-18s. Users will be nudged to create rather than consume. There will be watermarks both visible and invisible on all videos, as well as strict opt-ins for your likeness being used. Inputs will be classified and then potentially blocked, and outputs will go through a reasoning model to see whether they should be blocked. Like I said, you can't just input an image and output a video, or go from video to video, so that's blocked. And these categories are also blocked from display. So if you were hoping for some wrongdoing, you'll have to look elsewhere. Which brings me to the Cameo feature, which is unique at the moment at least to Open AI's Sora app. For this feature, you can't just upload a video of yourself, otherwise you get a bunch of deep fakes. But you have to record yourself saying things that Open AI get you to say. That kind of proves that you are who you are, and then you can insert your likeness into any new video or existing video. This is at the moment a unique feature available for Sora 2. That's why you've been seeing all that Sam Altman content, and the intention is that no one can take your likeness and make a video of you without your permission. And even if one of your invited friends does that, you can then delete the ones you don't like. Given how low the bar is at the moment for deep fakes, I actually commend them for setting some standards. But the real master plan can be found in Sam Altman's blog post from just 18 hours ago, and that has plenty of juicy details you may have missed. They were clearly very hesitant about launching a social media app, and you could see the hesitation on their faces when some of the leads for Sora 2 were announcing it. First, apparently, there are going to be periodic checks in the app on how Sora is impacting users' mood and well-being. I presume a lot of people are going to spam thumbs up just to avoid being blocked out of the app. But then comes the centerpiece promise, which is big if true. They will have a rule such that the majority of users, looking back on the past six months, should feel that their life is better for using Sora than it would have been if they hadn't. If that's not the case, we will make significant changes (and if we can't fix it, we would discontinue offering the service). And by the way, you can direct message other people, so it is social media. Taken at face value, this means that Sora does have to be net beneficial for humanity to continue. However, let's just say that if you look at the track record, not every promise issued by Open AI has been fully upheld. Just to take one example, the CEO of Open AI when it was launched said that setting up this Manhattan Project for AI called Open AI. They would obviously comply with and aggressively support all regulation. They now employ a whole bunch of lobbyists who are partly responsible for blocking certain pieces of regulation. My prediction is that this promise will be quietly forgotten. Now I say all that, but I must confess that with Sora 2 and this app, my feelings are about as mixed as they possibly could be. You will very likely be able to find me sending memes of me in certain activities to some of my friends. I think there's going to be huge entertainment value and even some practical utility. As one of the leads for Sora 2 said, Will de Pew, one of the biggest bottlenecks in science at the moment is good simulators for RL. But then we can imagine elders and eventually ourselves falling for the kind of slop and not being able to believe anything. Sam Altman even admits, if you just truly want to doom scroll and be angry, then okay, we'll help you with that (although we want users to spend time using the app if they think it's time well spent, we don't want to be paternalistic about what that means to them). But that's quite a big zoom out. For now, my take is that a social media app is actually quite a clever way to build a moat in an environment that doesn't have many at the moment. It is so easy to flip from Sora 2 and just use VEO3 or soon VEO3.1, or maybe Clyn 2.5 which was just announced. When C-Dream becomes a video generator, you could just hop to that. How do you get people to stay using your video generator? How does Open AI make a profit? Well, if you're locked into a social media app and all your friends are on it, and you want to use your own or their likeness, but not have others use your likeness, well then you have the Sora app. So I think it quite cleverly locks you into their system. Open AI did also claim in the launch video that Sora 2 is a step towards a generalist agent, and I get that they have to say that because the company mission is officially, we're literally building AGI. So everything has to get wrapped up into that vision. But Sora 2 seems more like a side quest that might add XP, but isn't directly on course. Much more on course for me would be something like Periodic Labs. I mentioned in my last video how exploration and experimentation is one of the last big blockers toward a singularity if you will. Even if you solve hallucinations and the data problem and the modeling problem, models are still passive, they're not exploring the world. Well, Periodic Labs want them to automate science, run experiments autonomously. I interviewed one of the founders who came from Google DeepMind a little while ago for a Patreon video, and another one of their founders, William Fedus, came from Open AI. I believe he was behind ChatGPT in part. This story, I realize, is almost the polar opposite of Sora 2, because it's immensely physical and in the real world. It's also not available immediately, but the idea, roughly speaking is this. If we want to, for example, come up with a room temperature superconductor or better solar batteries, then there are a few bottlenecks. First is running enough experiments. Well, what if we could have deep learning systems predict what an experiment will yield and then have say humanoid robots conduct those experiments autonomously? That might remove one bottleneck. Then what about those terabytes and terabytes of data generated by existing experiments that LLM's can't use? What if a lab collected all of that data in an LLM-friendly format which could then be fed into the latest model? Finally, I think we all know that there are just thousands and thousands of papers out there that we're never going to get around to read. So what about an AI model optimized for literature review? It could find from the literature what are the most promising experiments to run. Anyway, the big reveal is that Periodic Labs with $300 million in funding is going to work on all of those. Why even bring this up? Well, partly to contrast with Sora 2 and the claims of being a generalist agent. But also I guess for those people who think all of AI is bad and it's nothing but slop. In fairness, those results aren't going to come overnight, so in the meantime, let's talk about job opportunities that you could apply for even today. The sponsors of today's video are 80,000 hours, and in particular their job board, which you can access through a link in the description. These are jobs that are available around the world, both remote and in-person, and you can see the list is updated daily. The focus is on positive impact and as you can see it spans from entry-level to senior roles. Again, if you're curious, check out the link in the description. The obvious thing to say about Sora 2 is the moment it's out, that forever will be the worst that AI ever is at video generation. Likewise, Claude Sonnet 4.5, which is claimed to be the best coding model in the world, although they don't fully have the stats to back that up, is, I guess, the worst that coding is ever going to be via an LLM. By the way, just on that point about them not backing it up, I do get that they have benchmarks showing that it's the best. But then there'll be other benchmarks showing that Codex is the best, so where's the definitive proof that on all metrics it's the best coding model? But that's for another discussion. I've been testing Claude 4.5 Sonnet for quite a few days, and to everyone's amazement, we actually got an early result on simple bench, and yes this is with thinking enabled, and it was 54%. Big step up from Claude 4 Sonnet, and it does feel in the ballpark of Claude 4.1 Opus when I'm doing coding. On one benchmark at least, Swe bench verified, it even beats Opus 4.1. And you might say, well, that's already a model from Anthropic, so what's the big deal? It's like five times cheaper. You try using Opus 4.1 in Cursa and you really do have to get the textbook out. For me this just goes to show that a few months after each new breakthrough in AI, there is a breakthrough in price, wherein the earlier breakthrough is suddenly then as cheap as the models that came before that breakthrough. Or to bring that back to video, there will likely be a video generation model released by some Chinese company, which is as good as Sora 2 with fewer filters and way, way cheaper in say three to six months. Before we end though, a quick word on the future, because it's almost a given that in a few years you can imagine a button on your TV remote that you could press and just add your stored face as a selected character in any show that you're watching. That is coming. It's just a matter of whether it's two years or four years away. Suddenly Netflix will be all about you. But then here's what I've been thinking about, and forgive me for the digression. But we already have models that pass the written Turing test. As in you can't distinguish that you're talking to a model, not a human. And in Sora 2 is much closer to passing the visual one. It's not there, despite the hype posts, unless you're visually impaired, especially gullible or just see a couple of seconds at a glance. But I think we have to admit we are getting closer and closer to passing the visual Turing test. Not being able to tell that the video we're watching is real or fake. But what happens after we pass the visual Turing test? And then the audio Turing test. And then the somatic sensory system test so that we feel artificial worlds in our nervous systems and can literally touch them. You can think of each of our senses like a benchmark that we're getting closer to crushing. What happens when we have models that can create entire worlds from scratch in real time that are indistinguishable from reality according to every sense we humans have? If we can be fooled visually, why not with audio or with touch or taste? When that happens, we might look back to Sora 2 as one step along that fascinating, exciting and treacherous path. Let me know what you think. Thank you so much for watching, and have a wonderful day. What's up everyone? Welcome to Sora 2. You finally made it. I'm so, so excited to see you here. I've been waiting all week for this moment and it's real now. You're actually here. Yeah, those GPUs behind me are literally on fire. It's fine. We'll deal with that later, right? Knowledge is not a destination. It's a companion for the road."

            "transcription": "Another part of Putin's sad story has to do with NATO. So if you look at NATO, you can look at its accession arcs. Initially in the Cold War, early Cold War, it's all of these smaller European nations. And everybody's smaller than Russia. It's by far the biggest country on the planet. and why they need more territory remains a mystery. But initially it's the smaller places joining NATO to protect themselves. And then at the implosion of the Soviet Union, it's all its former satellites fleeing at the first possible moment and saying NATO, NATO, let me in. Now here are the places that Russia's actually taken lately. At the end of the Cold War, it took Transnistria from Moldova, in 2008 it took Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia. And then 2014, it's taking Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk from Ukraine. And then look how it really works. You want to color it all in. With the Ukraine 2022 part of the Ukraine war, Sweden and Finland, which long had preferred neutrality, said, \"Oh, no, no, we're gonna join NATO.\" Now, the Russians look at this and they go, \"Well, this is NATO coming at us in arcs.\" They're ignoring complicity in all of this. So if you occupy places and brutalize them for generations, this is what you get. So,"
