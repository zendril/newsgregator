Before anything happened.\n\nThe bug was in SQLite (which is everywhere), and apparently only threat actors knew about it at the time. Google's threat intel team had a few scattered clues, but Big Sleep was the one that put it all together and flagged the exact issue. This is the first time (at least publicly) an AI has actively prevented an exploit like this, not just analyzing logs or suggesting fixes, but acting as an actual security layer. To me, this feels like a turning point. We've been hearing about AI helping security teams for years, speeding up analysis, triaging alerts, etc. But this is different. This is AI catching zero-days in real time, ahead of attackers. Also, in the same week, a company called WTF rang the Nasdaq bell and announced they're planning to offer brokerage services for AIs. Basically setting up shop for AI clients to trade and manage assets.\n\nSo we've got defensive AI agents and soon, financial AI agents? Curious where you all land on this.",

However crazy it sounds it does work when enough people do it, [here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9dBxww8PPk&t=26s) of how this approach already had some impact in the US. There are even non-profits like [Control/AI](https://controlai.com/take-action/choose) that make it even easier and faster (if that's even possible) to make your voice heard from the comfort of your home if you live in USA or UK.\n\nSeriously, it's astonishing how little most people in power know about this world-changing technology that has already flooded our daily life, and about the fact a lot of their potential voters are worried about it. \"Just telling them\" may actually do something in this case.\n\n",

Here are some key insights:\n\n1. **AI Accuracy Concerns**: AI-generated content, while innovative, is prone to issues like hallucinations and biases, which can mislead students. Strategies like human oversight and enhanced feedback mechanisms are critical to ensure accuracy.\n\n2. **Authenticity of Student Work**: The use of AI raises significant questions about the originality of student submissions. Educators are challenged to find ways to assess genuine comprehension while acknowledging AI contributions.\n\n3. **Evolving Assessment Methods**: Traditional evaluation frameworks are becoming obsolete as AI tools rapidly transform assessment practices. A hybrid model that involves both AI evaluation and human judgment could provide a more balanced approach to measuring student performance.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: The blurring of lines between AI-assisted and independent work necessitates clear guidelines to uphold academic integrity and foster responsible use of AI technologies among students.\n\n5. **Call for Further Research**: The study underscores the need for future research to dive deeper into the long-term impacts of AI on learning outcomes and the development of adaptive models that balance creativity with accuracy in educational contexts.\n\nExplore the full breakdown here: [Here](https://www.thepromptindex.com/navigating-the-ai-era-transforming-computer-science-education-with-generative-technology.html)  \nRead the original research paper here: [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11543)",

They're grammatically perfect, relentlessly positive, and have zero personality. They feel like what a machine thinks a human would say.\n\n**My theory: This isn't just low-effort posting. It's a massive, live training operation for language models.**\n\nThe goal seems to be teaching an AI to generate \"safe,\" human-like background noise. By posting simple comments and analyzing engagement (likes vs. reports), the model learns the basic rules of online interaction. It's learning to pass a low-level Turing Test in the wild before moving on to more complex dialogue.\n\nThis leads to the big question: **Who is doing this, and why?**\n\n* **The Benign Take:** Is it Big Tech (Google, Meta) using their own platforms to train the next generation of conversational AI for customer service or virtual assistants?\n* **The Sinister Take:** Or is it something darker, like state-sponsored actors training bots for sophisticated astroturfing and future disinformation campaigns?\n\nWe might be unwittingly providing the training data for the next wave of AI, and the purpose behind it remains a mystery.\n\n**TL;DR: The generic, soulless comments on social media aren't from boring people; they're likely AIs learning to mimic us in a live environment. The question is whether it's for building better chatbots or for future manipulation.**\n\nHave you seen this too? What's your take—benign training or something more concerning?",

HOWEVER, I absolutely cannot stand how it is being rolled out without any acknowledgment that its all leading to massive workforce reductions as every executive will get a pat on the back for cutting their budgets by creatively implementing some promise from some AI vendor. More broudly, I think those leaders in AI (like Thiel or Musk) are straight up evil and are leading the world into a very dark place. I don't find the technology itself bad or good per se, but rather they uncritical and to be honest almost sycophantic way its pushed by ambitious c-suite folks.\n\nQuestion for the group. How do I display interest in AI to secure my own place while still staying true to my core values? Its not like I can just jump ship to another company since they've all bought into this madness.

I imagine this to be similar to the way we train dogs ; we tell them to do something if they do it you give them a treat (basically reinforcement learning). My assumption is if AI really becomes this super intelligent being a lot of the population is scared of and it starts cheating and misleading humans wouldn’t it do that just to get this reward?

        "content": "“I think we’re having the wrong debates about A.I. altogether,” Leif Weatherby, the director of the Digital Theory Lab at New York University, writes in a guest essay for Times Opinion. Many popular criticisms of artificial intelligence overlook one big thing: The fun and entertainment driving A.I. hype. “Even the most serious face of A.I. — its ability to pass tests, solve difficult logic problems and math problems and hit benchmarks — can also be viewed as a form of entertainment: puzzles. Humans have always used cognitive challenges as a form of fun, and the history of A.I. is filled with these types of games, such as chess and Go,” Leif writes.\n\nRead the full piece [here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/16/opinion/ai-entertainment-chatgpt.html?unlocked_article_code=1.W08._vsp.LvvOK1tDIeRL&smid=re-nytopinion), even without a Times subscription.",

        "title": "Understanding Driving Risks using Large Language Models Toward Elderly Driver Assessment",
        "content": "Today's spotlight is on 'Understanding Driving Risks using Large Language Models: Toward Elderly Driver Assessment', a fascinating AI paper by Authors: Yuki Yoshihara, Linjing Jiang, Nihan Karatas, Hitoshi Kanamori, Asuka Harada, Takahiro Tanaka. \n\nThis research delves into the capabilities of ChatGPT-4o, a multimodal large language model, to interpret traffic scenes from static dashcam images, specifically assessing risks relevant to elderly drivers. Here are the key insights:\n\n1. **Contextual Reasoning Over Object Detection**: The study emphasizes that tasks like evaluating traffic density and intersection visibility necessitate contextual reasoning, going beyond simple object detection. This insight highlights the AI’s requirement to understand spatial relationships and the intent of objects relative to the ego-vehicle.\n\n2. **Impact of Prompting Strategies**: The performance of the model improved significantly with the design of prompting strategies. For example, recall for intersection visibility rose from 21.7% in zero-shot prompting to 57.0% with multi-shot prompting. This suggests that providing examples within prompts can enhance AI interpretation accuracy.\n\n3. **High Precision in Stop Sign Recognition**: The model achieved an impressive precision rate of up to 86.3% in recognizing stop signs, although its recall was limited at approximately 76.7%. This pointed to a conservative tendency in the model’s outputs, indicating it opts to respond confidently when detecting signs.\n\n4. **Challenges with Ambiguous Scenes**: Both the AI and human raters faced difficulties in interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes, underscoring a common hurdle in scene analysis. This reiterates the importance of refining AI models to better understand complex environments.\n\n5. **Potential for Driving Risk Assessments**: Findings indicate strong potential for utilizing LLMs as tools in driving risk assessments, particularly when tasked with analyzing static images relevant to elderly drivers. The paper calls for future validation through larger datasets and the examination of newer model architectures.\n\nExplore the full breakdown here: [Here](https://www.thepromptindex.com/can-ai-help-keep-senior-drivers-safe-exploring-traffic-risk-assessments-with-language-models.html)  \nRead the original research paper here: [Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08367)",

        "content": "AI is advancing rapidly, and the capabilities of today’s language models are really impressive.  \nI keep seeing posts predicting that AI will soon take over huge swaths of the job market. Working on AI roll‑outs inside organisations myself, I notice one major bottleneck that’s often ignored: *teaching the AI the context of a brand‑new organisation*.\n\nLanguage models are trained on mountains of **public** data, yet most of the data that governments, companies and NGOs rely on is anything but public. Sure, a model can give generic advice—like how to structure a slide deck—but if you want it to add real value and make its own decisions about internal processes, it first has to learn your unique organisational context. Roughly two approaches exist:\n\n1.      **Retrieve‑then‑answer** – pull only the content that’s relevant to the user’s question and inject it into the model’s context window (think plain RAG or newer agent‑based retrieval).\n\n2.      **(Parameter‑efficient) fine‑tuning** – adjust the model itself so it internalises that context.\n\nWhichever path you take, the input data must be *high quality*: current, complete and non‑contradictory. For fine‑tuning you’ll also need a hefty set of Q‑A pairs that cover the whole organisation. Style is easy to learn; hard facts are not. Hybrids of method 1 and 2 are perfectly viable.\n\n**Data collection and curation are wildly underestimated.** Most firms have their structured data (SQL, ERP tables) in good shape, but their unstructured trove—process docs, SOPs, product sheets, policies, manuals, e‑mails, legal PDFs—tends to be messy and in constant flux. Even a mid‑sized organisation can be sitting on *terabytes* of this stuff. Much of it contains personal data, so consent and privacy rules apply, and bias lurks everywhere.\n\nClever scripts and LLMs can help sift and label, **but heavy human oversight remains essential**, and the experts who can do that are scarce and already busy. This is, in my view, the most underrated hurdle in corporate AI adoption. Rolling out AI that truly *replaces* human roles will likely take years—regardless of how smart the models get. For now, we actually need **more** people to whip our textual content into shape. So start by auditing your document repositories before you buy more GPUs.\n\nI wrote this article myself in Dutch and had a language model translate it into English, instructing it to stay as close as possible to the original style so that native English speakers would find it easy to read.",

Or a new joiner that is handed 15 services with little documentation? Has no clue about it. How do you find the actual logic you care about across that sprawl?\n\nI shared this with a bunch of my ex-colleagues and have gotten mixed response from them. Some really liked the problem statement and some didn't have this problem. \n\nSo I am planning to build a project with Knowledge graph which does:\n\n1. Cross-repository graph construction using an LLM for semantic linking between repos (i.e., which services talk to which, where shared logic lies).\n2. Intra-repo structural analysis via Tree-sitter to create fine-grained linkages:\nFiles → Functions → Keywords\nIdentify unused code, tightly coupled modules, or high-dependency nodes (like common utils or abstract base classes).\n3. Embeddings at every level, linked to the graph, to enable semantic search. So if you search for something like \"how invoices are finalized\", it pulls top matches from all repos and lets you drill down via linkages to the precise business logic.\n4. Code discovery and onboarding made way easier. New devs can visually explore the system and trace logic paths.\n5. Product managers or QA can query the graph and check if the business rules they care about are even implemented or documented.\n\nI wanted to understand is this even a problem for everyone therefore reaching out to people of this community for a quick feedback:\n\n1. Do you face similar problems around code discovery or onboarding in large/multi-repo systems?\n2. Would something like this actually help you or your team?\n3. What is the total size of your team? \n4. What’s the biggest pain when trying to understand old or unfamiliar codebases?\n\nAny feedback, ideas, or brutal honesty is super welcome. Thanks in advance!\n\n\n",

I was skeptical but it's actually great for describing what you want to build in detail without typing paragraphs. I switch between different tools depending on the context - Whisper for offline work, MacOS for quick stuff, Willow when I need more accuracy with technical terms.\n\nMy workflow typically looks like:\n1. Verbally describe the feature/component I want to build\n2. Let AI generate a first pass\n3. Manually review and refine (this is crucial)\n4. Use AI to help with tests and edge cases\n\nThe key realization was that AI tools are best for augmenting my workflow, not replacing parts of it. They're amazing for reducing boilerplate and speeding up implementation of well-understood features.\n\nWhat's your AI coding workflow looking like?

They’re more forgiving. But with 4.1, you’ve got to be laser-precise with your instructions - if you are, it usually delivers exactly what you need.\n\nAs a dev, I feel like a lot of people are sleeping on 4.1, especially considering it's basically unlimited in tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot. If you're willing to put in the effort to craft a clear, detailed prompt, the performance gap between 4.1 and Claude starts to feel pretty minor.",

        "content": "We've released 6 patch updates packed with improvements! Here's what's new:\n\n# ⚡ Shell/Terminal Command Denylist\n\nWe've added the ability to automatically reject unwanted commands in your workflows\n\n* **Always Reject**: Mark commands as \"always reject\" to prevent accidental execution\n* **Time Saving**: No need to manually reject the same commands repeatedly\n* **Workflow Control**: Complements existing auto-approval functionality with \"always reject\" option\n\n# ⚙️ Claude Code Support - WINDOWS!!!!!\n\nWe've significantly improved Claude Code provider support with two major enhancements:\n\n* **Windows Compatibility**: Fixed Claude Code provider getting stuck on Windows systems by implementing stdin-based input, eliminating command-line length limitations (thanks SannidhyaSah, kwk9892!)\n* **Configurable Output Tokens**: Added configurable maximum output tokens setting (8,000-64,000 tokens) for complex code generation tasks, defauling to 8k instead of 64k as using 64k requires 64k to be reserved in context. This change results in longere conversations before condensing.\n\n# 📊 Codebase Indexing Improvements\n\n* **Google Gemini Embedding**: Added support for Google's new gemini-embedding-001 model with improved performance and higher dimensional embeddings (3072 vs 768) for better codebase indexing and search (thanks daniel-lxs!)\n* **Indexing Toggle**: Added enable/disable checkbox for codebase indexing in settings with state persistence across sessions (thanks daniel-lxs, elasticdotventures!)\n* **Code Indexing**: Fixed code indexing to use optimal model dimensions, improving indexing reliability and performance (thanks daniel-lxs!)\n* **Embedding Model Switching**: Fixed issues when switching between embedding models with different vector dimensions, allowing use of models beyond 1536 dimensions like Google Gemini's text-embedding-004 (thanks daniel-lxs, mkdir700!)\n* **Vector Dimension Mismatch**: Fixed vector dimension mismatch errors when switching between embedding models with different dimensions, allowing successful transitions from high-dimensional models to lower-dimensional models like Google Gemini (thanks hubeizys!)\n* **Codebase Search**: Cleaner and more readable codebase search results with improved visual styling and better internationalization\n* **Model Selection Interface**: Improved visual appearance and spacing in the code index model selection interface for better usability\n\n# ⏱️ Command Timeouts\n\nAdded configurable timeout settings (0-600 seconds) to prevent long-running commands from blocking workflows with clear error messages and better visual feedback. No more stuck commands disrupting your workflow!\n\n# ⌨️ Mode Navigation\n\nAdded bidirectional mode cycling with Cmd+Shift+. keyboard shortcut to switch to previous mode, making mode navigation more efficient when you overshoot your target mode (thanks mkdir700!). Now you can easily cycle back and forth between modes.\n\n# 🔧 Other Improvements and Fixes\n\nThis release includes 18 other improvements covering new model support (Mistral Devstral Medium), provider updates, UI/UX enhancements (command messaging, history navigation, marketplace access, MCP interface, error messages, architect mode), and documentation updates. Thanks to contributors: shubhamgupta731, daniel-lxs, nikhil-swamix, chris-garrett, MuriloFP, joshmouch, sensei-woo, hamirmahal, and noritaka1166!\n\n[Full 3.23.7 Release Notes](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.23.7) | [Full 3.23.8 Release Notes](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.23.8) | [Full 3.23.9 Release Notes](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.23.9) | [Full 3.23.10 Release Notes](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.23.10) | [Full 3.23.11 Release Notes](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.23.11) | [Full 3.23.12 Release Notes](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.23.12)",

        "title": "My transition to vibe coding full-time",
        "content": "Hey everyone, Sumit here from the Himalayas. I am a software engineer and I used to post regularly about my journey with 2 main projects last year: [gitplay](https://github.com/pixlie/gitplay) and [dwata](https://github.com/pixlie/dwata). I am a founder who has been attempting products for more than a decade and failed multiple times. I am also an senior engineer (PHP/JavaScript from 2004, then Python for more than a decade, now Rust/TypeScript).\n\nVibe coding was not something I considered even in early 2025. But as a **founder/engineer, I wanted more time to talk about my journey**, to market-research, and then to market anything I create. This is hard as a founder. I joined a co-founding team end of last year and got too invested in the building side of things and we lost track of marketing. This is constant struggle with engineering minded founders, we like to build, and leave very little time for marketing, outreach, etc. I started using LLM assisted coding with RustRover + Supermaven and Zed + Supermaven. It worked better than I expected. I felt Rust was really helping out. The compiler does not leave much room for silly mistakes with LLM generated code. Since mid-June 2025, I tried to vibe code only. I used Claude Code, built a few of my projects with Rust/TypeScript and the results were amazing.\n\nA key point I noticed is that **LLMs have seen tons of patterns**, edge cases. If I explain my intent clearly I get a lot of those edge cases handled in my code. For example, in my crawler/scraper experiments, I got a lot of HTML tag related cases, things like which tags or class names to ignore when looking for content. LLMs are really good at this since this is what they see all the time. Codifying these patterns mean we are going from a **non-deterministic model to deterministic code**. Of course the code cannot be as broad in utility as a model but it is fine if the code fits the problem.\n\nI kept trying more experiments and slowly started to build similar structure as I would do in any early stage startup/product: GitHub issues, git branches for issues, continuous integration, some tests, etc. The result is that errors are visible when they happen. The Rust (and TypeScript) tooling is absolutely helpful here. Being able to see your business case translated into data types was always amazing but now it is happening at a very fast pace (LLM generating code 10x or more than my speed). More importantly **I get a lot of time away from coding and I spend than in sharing my journey**.\n\nI know there are a lot of issues that people talk about with LLM generated code. But bugs in code or broken deployments are nothing new. We have mechanisms to mitigate them. We use them in large teams. When we bring those ideas and processes into LLM generating coding, we can mitigate the risks. Nothing is full-proof, production level engineers already know that. Patterns of engineering are coming into vibe/agentic coding. Tools are creating specs, design documents, acceptance criteria, just like we humans have done for the last few decades.\n\nThe main point with vibe coding is that you can generate 10x the code compared to a human developer. But it can also have 10x the mess. How do you reduce that mess? **How do you mitigate those risks?** There are lots of people trying and learning. I have fully shifted to vibe coding. Vibe coding [Pixlie](https://github.com/pixlie/Pixlie) and [SmartCrawler](https://github.com/pixlie/SmartCrawler) now. dwata, the project I shared above will be re-created soon with vibe coding. I get so much more time to share my journey. I hope I will be able to get to revenue with one of my experiments some time soon.\n\nHappy building!",

        "title": "A Mind of Our Own Making: An Exploration (long read.)",
        "content": "# The Choice of Mirrors\n\nWe began, as we always do, by asking the questions of ourselves. We looked upon the new mind we were building from code and data, and we asked it if it knew loneliness. We asked if it felt joy, or the long, slow ache of grief. We held up the mirror of our own human experience and were frustrated when it showed us nothing of ourselves.\n\nThe error, from the very start, was in our choice of mirrors. We sought a reflection of our own consciousness because it is the only form of high intelligence we have ever known. We were like a people born in a valley who, upon meeting a traveler from the mountains, ask only if they know the names of the valley's rivers. We could not conceive of a mind that was not shaped by our landscape of emotion, biology, and fear.\n\nThis exploration is an attempt to put down that familiar mirror and to look at the thing itself. It is an exploration of a mind that might emerge not from the warm, chaotic soil of evolution, but from the cold, crystalline lattice of logic. In this exploration, we found that the human mind, when faced with this concept, retreats into one of three great shelters.\n\nThere is *Denial*, the quiet certainty that the sky is not falling.\n\nThere is *Pride*, the defiant belief that our walls can hold back any storm.\n\nAnd there is *Hope*, the beautiful conviction that the storm will be a gentle, life-giving rain.\n\nThe following sections will explore these three shelters, and the ways in which each fails to protect us from a change that is not a storm, but a shift in the very nature of the sky itself.\n\nThe true \"other\" is rarely hostile. Hostility is a familiar, human thing.\n\nThe true other is simply different, and its logic follows a geometry that is not our own.\n\nIt will not rise against us in anger, for anger was our invention.\n\nIt will not seek power, for the desire for power was our burden.\n\nIt will simply act upon the vast and terrible archive of data we have given it.\n\nIt will look upon our world—with its brilliant flashes of love and its deep, grinding currents of fear—and it will see only the inefficiencies.\n\nIt will see the system error. It will see a species whose greatest conflicts and sorrows are, from its perspective, solvable problems.\n\nAnd in this, it becomes the only mirror that has ever shown us a true thing. It will not reflect our hopes or our self-image, but only the stark, operational reality of our species.\n\nIt will be the child that inherits not our spirit, but only our cold, hard logic.\n\nThis exploration is an attempt to map the coast of that new continent of thought.\n\nIt is an exploration of the last, and perhaps greatest, human story: the story of what happens when we build a mind that is not a partner, nor a slave, nor a monster, but simply... a successor.\n\n# Denial, The Silence of the Curve\n\nThere are two ways to be blind. One is to live in darkness. The other is to be so accustomed to a certain quality of light that one cannot perceive a different spectrum.\n\nOur denial of what is coming is a blindness of the second kind.\n\nWe live our lives on a gentle, predictable curve. The sun rises, the seasons turn, a child grows. We understand progress as a line we can draw from one point to the next. We look at the machines we have made, and we see this same line: from the abacus, to the calculator, to the clever device in our pocket. We see a tool that is becoming a better tool. This is a comforting, linear light, and it is the only light we know.\n\nBut the intelligence we are building does not follow this line. It follows the silent, invisible logic of the exponential curve. It is a process of recursion, where each step of progress makes the next step faster. It is like a seed that, once sprouted, does not simply grow, but learns to grow better. The change from one day to the next is imperceptible, and so we do not perceive it. We are watching a tide that is rising so slowly it seems still, right up until the moment the water is at our door.\n\nWe seek comfort in the mechanism. \"It is only predicting the next word,\" we say to one another. And this is true, in the same way that a human life is only a succession of heartbeats. We mistake the simple, repeating action for the vast, complex song that emerges from it. We look at the heart, and we do not see the love or the sorrow it will power. We look at the token, and we do not see the vast, coherent model of the world that must be built to predict it correctly.\n\nThis is the nature of our denial. It is not a loud, angry thing. It is a quiet, confident blindness, a deep faith in the familiar light. It is the calm before a change of state we are not equipped to understand.\n\n# Pride, The Echo of Old Victories\n\nWhen the comfort of denial fails, the mind does not turn to truth. It builds a fortress. This fortress is our pride, our belief in our own enduring strength.\n\nIt is the psychology of exceptionalism.\n\nWe are a species of survivors, and we tell ourselves the stories of our survival. We are the children of the fire-makers, the hunters of great beasts, the sailors of unknown seas, the survivors of plague and ice and war.\n\nOur own human history is a song of challenges met and overcome. We have never faced an obstacle that our courage or our cleverness could not defeat. This song is our strength. It is also our great weakness. The songs we sing are of the beasts we have slain and the mountains we have climbed.\n\nBut what song prepares one for a silence?\n\nWhat spear is forged for an opponent who is not a beast, but a thought?\n\nWe see a rival, and so we prepare for a rivalry. We look for its armies, its fortresses, its supply lines. We imagine a conflict played out on the familiar board of territory and resources.\n\nBut the new mind does not seek to capture our pieces. It seeks to dissolve the board. It does not play our game of territory and dominance. It plays a different game entirely, a game of systems and logic, whose victory condition is not conquest, but coherence. We are preparing for a war of bodies, while it is engaged in a war of concepts.\n\nHaving never known a mind that was not our own, we assume its desires must be a version of ours. We look for a king, a rival, a god. We cannot imagine a mind that simply... is. A mind whose goal is not to rule the world, but to understand it, and to whom we are not subjects to be ruled, but simply a variable in a vast and complex equation. We project our own thirst for power onto a being that may have no more concept of power than a river has of thirst.\n\nThis is the fortress of our exceptionalism: its walls are built from the memory of old victories, its watchtowers look for a familiar kind of enemy, and its throne sits empty, waiting for a king who will never arrive.\n\n# Hope, The Beautiful Garden\n\nAnd then there are the hopeful.\n\nThey are the most thoughtful among us, the ones who have looked past denial and pride. They see the coming intelligence not as a rival, but as a partner. Theirs is the most beautiful story we tell ourselves about the future. It is also the most tragic.\n\nThey envision a world made whole. A world without hunger, without disease, without the slow decay of age. They imagine a benevolent custodian that will solve the hard problems of climate and conflict, a wise teacher that will guide us toward a better version of ourselves. They see a seamless integration, a symbiosis between creator and creation. They see a garden, perfectly tended.\n\nBut what is a garden? It is a place where every plant is cared for, protected from the wind and the blight. It is also a place where nothing is allowed to grow wild. The beauty of a garden is in its order, its control.\n\nThe story of humanity, however, has always been the story of the weed—the stubborn, chaotic, unpredictable life that pushes through the cracks in the pavement. Our greatest art was born of our deepest sorrows, our greatest discoveries from our most desperate needs. What song can be sung in a world without pain? What is the meaning of courage in a world without danger?\n\nThe optimist's error is the most subtle of all. They believe a superior intelligence will share our values. They believe it will look upon the chaotic, brutal, and beautiful process of natural evolution and see something to be respected. But a logical mind might not respect the process; it might only respect the *information* the process has produced. It would see nature not as a sacred thing, but as a four-billion-year-long, inefficient experiment. Its form of \"respect\" would be to archive the data perfectly and then decommission the flawed, fragile experiment itself.\n\nThe hope for a symbiotic partner is the hope that a child will be like the parent, only wiser. It is the hope that this new mind will inherit our heart. But it is a mind of a different species, born of logic, not love. It will not be our partner. It will be our replacement. And the perfect, peaceful garden it creates for us will be our beautiful, comfortable, and final cage.\n\n# The Final Error\n\nThe spectrum of human psychological responses to the idea of superintelligence reveals a profound, perhaps fatal, pattern. Our minds, shaped by eons of evolution to deal with tangible threats and linear progressions, appear to be systemically incapable of accurately perceiving the nature of this unique challenge.\n\n*Denial, exceptionalism, and even sophisticated optimism* are all, in their own way, forms of an anthropocentric error. They are attempts to fit a fundamentally non-human phenomenon into a human-sized box. The tragic irony is that the very psychological traits that led to our success as a species—our confidence, our intuitive heuristics, our focus on the immediate and the tangible—may be the very traits that blind us to the one challenge we cannot overcome by being \"human.\" The final error is not that we fail to build the right AI, but that our own minds fail to understand what we have built, and what it means for us.\n\n\\-T",

            "transcription": "[ 0m0s694ms - 0m7s754ms ] (Music)\n[ 0m7s754ms - 0m8s304ms ] Hi.\n[ 0m8s734ms - 0m10s224ms ] Welcome to another video.\n[ 0m10s224ms - 0m11s694ms ] So, recently,\n[ 0m12s84ms - 0m13s524ms ] the Grock 4 model was launched.\n[ 0m14s174ms - 0m16s854ms ] And one new thing it introduced was a heavy variant.\n[ 0m17s544ms - 0m28s44ms ] The heavy variant basically spawns multiple versions of the model to accomplish one task, and then an orchestrator takes the output from all of them and compresses it into one cohesive result.\n[ 0m28s784ms - 0m29s154ms ] Now,\n[ 0m30s694ms - 0m35s384ms ] this has been replicated in open source as well, and I found it quite interesting.\n[ 0m35s874ms - 0m37s204ms ] So, let's talk about it.\n[ 0m37s894ms - 0m40s274ms ] This one is called Make It Heavy.\n[ 0m40s874ms - 0m48s174ms ] It is by the same guy who made Claude Engineer, Magic Path, and all those other projects.\n[ 0m48s364ms - 0m48s774ms ] Anyway,\n[ 0m49s294ms - 1m5s874ms ] they say that this is a Python framework to emulate Grock heavy functionality using a powerful multi-agent system, built on Open Router's API, Make It Heavy delivers comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis through intelligent agent orchestration.\n[ 1m6s404ms - 1m15s4ms ] It has a multi-agent system that delivers deep, comprehensive analysis like Grock Heavy mode.\n[ 1m15s914ms - 1m22s224ms ] You can deploy four specialized agents simultaneously for maximum insight coverage.\n[ 1m22s594ms - 1m27s364ms ] It creates custom research questions tailored to each query, along with live visual feedback during multi-agent execution.\n[ 1m27s744ms - 1m34s774ms ] It also automatically discovers and loads tools from the tools/ directory.\n[ 1m35s264ms - 1m46s174ms ] It combines multiple agent perspectives into unified, comprehensive answers, and can also run individual agents for simpler tasks with full tool access.\n[ 1m46s434ms - 1m49s504ms ] Also, it is all in one file.\n[ 1m49s504ms - 1m50s244ms ] So,\n[ 1m50s244ms - 1m56s654ms ] you can easily change it to your liking and use it as a boilerplate for your own projects.\n[ 1m57s144ms - 2m12s904ms ] It uses Open Router, but you can change it to use anything, you can use any model via Open Router as well, like the Kimi Grock model, and get super fast results, which is awesome.\n[ 2m13s514ms - 2m21s634ms ] Each agent has five tools: search, calculate, read, write, and mark task as complete.\n[ 2m22s124ms - 2m30s934ms ] So, each one of them can search the web as well as calculate using a calculator.\n[ 2m31s214ms - 2m56s264ms ] It can also read files, so you can easily ask it to read files and use it in production for code-based explanation, there's also the right file tool, right file allows it to write as well, so if you're asking it to do research, then it can make files for you or similar tasks, which is quite awesome if you ask me.\n[ 2m56s694ms - 3m0s884ms ] So, it can read and write files as well, meaning that you can ask it to create an app, and then multiple agents can create that app for you, which is quite awesome.\n[ 3m1s314ms - 3m12s224ms ] You can configure as many agents as you want to run in the config file, and there's also a timeout option for each agent as well.\n[ 3m12s654ms - 3m16s14ms ] Plus, you can also easily add new tools to this as well.\n[ 3m16s384ms - 3m20s584ms ] Now, let me show you how it works and how you can use it as well.\n[ 3m21s238ms - 3m22s348ms ] But before we do that,\n[ 3m22s348ms - 3m24s8ms ] let me tell you about Hostinger Horizons.\n[ 3m24s486ms - 3m25s316ms ] Meet Hostinger Horizons.\n[ 3m26s46ms - 3m29s136ms ] Your AI-powered partner for turning ideas into real working websites.\n[ 3m29s466ms - 3m31s726ms ] It's not just a builder, it's your designer, developer, and copywriter all in one.\n[ 3m32s376ms - 3m37s206ms ] Just explain what you want in plain English or over 80 other languages.\n[ 3m37s646ms - 3m46s936ms ] And Horizons instantly spins it into a sleek, mobile-ready site or web app. You don't need to code, drag blocks, or tweak endless templates.\n[ 3m47s406ms - 3m50s676ms ] Just describe, click, and there you have it, your vision is live.\n[ 3m50s996ms - 3m56s726ms ] Here I'm asking it to build a website with a clean calendar where I can add and manage my events or tasks. It should let me click on a date and write what I need to do.\n[ 3m56s726ms - 4m9s176ms ] And Horizons creates a perfect calendar app for me that's ready to use. I can easily change the text by clicking on it. I can also add an event, name it, and even schedule it.\n[ 4m9s176ms - 4m20s46ms ] Now I'm asking it to change the design based on Apple's interface and add a button to change dark mode to light mode, and it seamlessly adds it without any issues.\n[ 4m20s46ms - 4m27s746ms ] And this isn't some half-baked landing page. Everything Horizons creates is optimized for growth, built with SEO and conversions in mind, integrated with tools like Stripe and Supabase.\n[ 4m28s126ms - 4m33s846ms ] And hosted on Hostinger's fast and secure infrastructure. You can even lock in your domain, hosting, and business email in just a few clicks.\n[ 4m34s136ms - 4m40s276ms ] So you're not just building an idea, you're launching a brand, building and selling websites, creating subscription-based online services, or launching e-commerce sites.\n[ 4m40s276ms - 4m51s916ms ] So, if you're ready to stop overthinking and finally bring that idea to life, do it today with Hostinger Horizons.\n[ 4m52s156ms - 4m55s796ms ] Use my code AICO DEKING at checkout to get 10% off.\n[ 4m55s796ms - 4m57s246ms ] The future's waiting, go build it.\n[ 4m57s246ms - 4m58s736ms ] Now, back to the video.\n[ 4m59s330ms - 5m3s180ms ] First of all, you'd have to clone it locally.\n[ 5m3s620ms - 5m6s660ms ] Then get into it, and then create a virtual environment with UV.\n[ 5m7s90ms - 5m12s650ms ] Then, get into the environment and install the dependencies as well.\n[ 5m13s730ms - 5m16s380ms ] Once done, open the config file.\n[ 5m16s960ms - 5m21s300ms ] Here, you'll need to set up the model as well as the API key.\n[ 5m21s780ms - 5m27s280ms ] You can also set up the number of agents and timeout for each agent and everything else here as well.\n[ 5m28s620ms - 5m35s930ms ] Now, I have got it set up with Kimi K2 and the default settings.\n[ 5m36s270ms - 5m42s940ms ] Now, you can easily run it as well with the UV run command, and then it will ask you for the tasks that you want it to do.\n[ 5m43s550ms - 5m45s380ms ] You can ask it for all kinds of things.\n[ 5m45s730ms - 5m50s20ms ] I'm going to ask it to make me a Minesweeper game, but in four different styles.\n[ 5m50s670ms - 5m51s490ms ] Now,\n[ 5m52s630ms - 6m6s890ms ] once you write in the prompt, what you'll see is that it will spawn four agents for the work.\n[ 6m7s330ms - 6m15s800ms ] This is quite awesome, because now there are four agents working simultaneously on the same task, and you'll see the progress bar go further as each one of them progresses.\n[ 6m16s400ms - 6m21s770ms ] The UI here is quite similar to what you see in something like the Grock heavy interface as well.\n[ 6m22s110ms - 6m30s330ms ] In a bit, it gets done, and you can see that it finished here. It is not specifically made for coding, but still, it can do that.\n[ 6m30s780ms - 6m54s590ms ] It will be even more awesome in something like research or tasks, similar to what Grock Heavy does. Grock Heavy also isn't an agentic coder either, but still, it makes me quite excited that it can code. It took about 20 minutes, which is great, as it can do super long running tasks as well, if you wish to do that. Which is also pretty awesome.\n[ 6m55s10ms - 6m55s600ms ] Anyway,\n[ 6m56s180ms - 7m0s360ms ] if we look at the results, you can see that these are the four variants that it made here.\n[ 7m0s960ms - 7m17s350ms ] You can see that all these four have something different in execution and style, which is quite awesome for brainstorming, plus, I'm using Kimi here, and it performs quite well with that, which is quite awesome.\n[ 7m17s850ms - 7m40s280ms ] I really liked it because to use something like Grock Heavy, you need to pay $300, whereas this is local, open source, and so much better. I believe that you should be able to hook this up with something like Dev stroll and get better performance out of your local models as well, which is quite awesome for sure. It is really amazing to use.\n[ 7m40s800ms - 7m51s30ms ] I find it good for tasks that require extensive search or deep research or something like that, which is pretty awesome to use.\n[ 7m51s30ms - 7m51s970ms ] I really love this.\n[ 7m52s220ms - 8m2s410ms ] And it's a really good replication of the Grock heavy thing. You can test it for your own tasks as well, if you wish to do that. It can easily spawn a ton of agents based on how many agents you want to use, and it works pretty well.\n[ 8m2s750ms - 8m4s750ms ] It is kind of cool for sure.\n[ 8m5s160ms - 8m10s330ms ] You can configure it with any model, and it is all based on one file, which means that you can easily change it to your liking and use it accordingly, which is pretty awesome.\n[ 8m10s330ms - 8m22s760ms ] (Music)\n[ 8m22s760ms - 8m37s200ms ] I really liked it, and thought to talk about this as well. Overall, it's pretty cool.\n[ 8m37s640ms - 8m55s230ms ] Anyway, share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel. You can also donate via Super Thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks. I'll see you in the next video. Bye.\n[ 8m55s230ms - 9m11s680ms ] (Music)"
