They would (at least initial for the first few 100K,) be easy to annotate. \n\nSomething like, \"white dot 512, 0 lens 01, intraocular distance 60mm white dot 0,0 lens 02 computed distance 20 meters\" and so on.\n\nYou'd go through 1000s of permutations of that, then colors and graduations and shifts and distances etc. Then two dots moving together, then separately etc. All the way up to \"objects\" occluding each other.\n\nThe data set would be enormous,  but it MIGHT enable the model to develop an internal model of objects and distances etc.\n\nIs this possible?

It feels like every day I see more wild claims being shared by people who clearly don’t understand how these systems actually work.\n\nI’ll be honest, after being bullied for politely commenting on a post about how prompt injection works, I even started to question myself for a moment and double checked what I already knew. Stepping back, it really seems like some people are more interested in going viral by stirring people up than actually having a discussion.\n\nIt’s not just annoying, it’s harmful. Technical terms like prompt injection, bots, and the difference between machine learning and AI are being thrown around in ways that are completely disconnected from reality.  Because the language sounds complex, people often accept it without questioning or verifying anything.\n\nPresenting misinformation as fact is irresponsible. AI is already misunderstood by the public, and these types of situations make things worse. It distracts from real conversations.\n\nI just hope more people take a moment to pause and think before repeating something that sounds good but has no foundation in actual systems design or implementation.\n\nWhat’s the most bizarre or misleading AI claim you’ve seen recently?\n",

        "content": "\nHey, I’m really thinking about this article and I don’t understand something: https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/congress-might-block-state-ai-laws-for-a-decade-heres-what-it-means/\n\nAltman keeps pushing for this narrative where “AI is evolving at unprecedented speeds” at the same being in favor of laws that stop AI regulations for 10 years. Which, if you didn’t figure it out yet, means that he wants to do whatever the fuck he wants without consequences - the premise being that “we must stop China from taking the lead”.\n\nMy two cents: I’m observing a tendency to use China as a scapegoat & to form strawmen arguments against it, when we clearly saw how big of a fail Deepseek was. They’re clearly using fascist/authoritarian narratives in which there’s an enemy and we must dominate that enemy at all costs. Because otherwise “our existence is in danger”. It’s a distraction and many people are falling into this trap. Keep someone busy thinking about something else, while you can do whatever the fuck you want in the meantime. That’s the point. Attention span is humanity’s most scarce resource in 2025, and they’re perfectly aware of this. Think about it.\n\n—\n\nI mean, let’s look at these paragraphs:\n\n“OpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared similar sentiments this week during a live recording of the tech podcast Hard Fork. He said while he believes some adaptive regulation that addresses the biggest existential risks of AI would be good, “a patchwork across the states would probably be a real mess and very difficult to offer services under.”\n\nAltman also questioned whether policymakers were equipped to handle regulating AI when the technology moves so quickly. ”\n\n\nor this, by Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer: \n\n“While not someone I’d typically quote, Vladimir Putin has said that whoever prevails will determine the direction of the world going forward.”\n\n\nAnd I’m asking this: If we’re not sure what the dangers of AI are: to economy, to jobs, to people, then why the fuck are we going full-speed ahead, with no brakes and no guardrails, being so confident that we won’t eventually hit a tree?\n\nI mean let’s hypothetically say US “wins the AI race” vs China. Sure. But at what cost?\n\n—\n\nHow are we supposed to adapt to this considering that AI (LLMs actually) integration into society has happened so quick and so poetically bad? Look at the Harvard studies on the brains of daily ChatGPT users.\n\nAll I’m seeing is that a group of smart guys planning to get as much power as possible under the premise of “human evolution”, while people are clearly missing the hints of danger that are ahead of us. They’re just raising enough capital right now,  so in the near future they don’t have to care that much about losing it by investing in AI.\n\nHow come Meta is suddenly so passionate about “human evolution” while literally trying to spend 30 billions for a 1 year old AI startup (Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence)? Who does that? Doesn’t that raise a huge red flag? The same Meta that was accused of unethical practices regarding data collection. The same company (former Facebook) that was part of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nSo what the fuck are we talking about? Are we all gonna be oblivious to the idea that it’s only a matter of time before this AI scene turns into a monopoly and becomes unstoppable?\n\nIdk, I’m enjoying LLMs and I think there are so many good uses for AI, but this feels very off.\nWhat do you think?\n\n—\n\nEdit: This post is NOT about LLMs. It is about LLM companies that right now are gaining enough capital and influence, so they could easily extend to AI given that they can afford to lose way more capital than startups. If they are currently trying to establish a monopoly in the “AI” market, what do you think is stopping them from spending tens of billions on actual AI, with potentially malicious intent behind their decisions, or simply incompetence? (the number of multi-billionaires that are actually interested in the evolution of humanity is EXTREMELY low - if there are truly any at all)\n\n—\n\nThey’re laying down the tracks for the entire railway system before anyone else can even start building their own lines. (metaphorically speaking) \n\nIf you own the rails, you control who rides on them and at what price, regardless of how many fancy new trains come along. That’s what it’s about. It’s power grabbing dressed up as pragmatism. \n\nYou can miss me with that China boogeyman bullshit, this is literally a distraction. I’m not gonna go into conspiracy theories, but neither am I gonna blindly  believe that a multi-billion company (that was accused of stealing data) is trying to get rid of regulations because of “stifling progress”. Who quotes Putin’s statement (cold-war style fear mongering) and then expects me to think that this is not a dirty attempt to gain monopoly and influence? Of all people, Putin. That’s supposed to make me feel safer about AI, when this is what the high level executives come up with? Just try to think critically about his statement, that’s all I’m asking.\n\nFeel free to downvote me, I don’t give a shit. Go do a research and you’ll see what I mean. And I’m saying this as an outsider - an european that’s not part of the US media & press bubble.\n\nJust replying with that “nO bRo, yOu dOnT uNdErsTaND AI, pRePaRe fOr SiNgULaRiTy” hype BS won’t convince me or pretty much anyone else to take you seriously, sorry.\n\nCheers",

        "content": "TL;DR\n\nCurious how others think about long-term system strain, AI health, and whether fallback infrastructure has a role in future LLM design.\n\nHere is the essay in full:\n\nMachine Hip Replacement Theory: Toward Immune-Aware AI Systems\n\nWe often speak of artificial intelligence in abstract terms—data, weights, models, and tokens—but beneath the surface lies a material truth: these systems run on physical substrates. Like the human body, they are vulnerable to strain, fatigue, and failure.\n\nMachine Hip Replacement Theory offers a metaphor for understanding the embodied limits of large language models (LLMs), especially when pushed beyond design thresholds. Just as excessive weight can degrade a human hip, sustained high-load processing can erode an LLM’s architecture—through overheating, memory saturation, or gradual degradation of tensor processing units (TPUs).\n\nBut this isn’t just poetic—it’s functional. As LLMs handle abstract or adversarial input, they become vulnerable to “malicious overclocking.” This is like a denial-of-service attack at the cognitive level: overloading the system with layered abstraction and entropy—not through traditional exploits, but conceptual strain. In this light, overuse becomes a vector of philosophical and computational risk.\n\nWe propose a new paradigm: an immune response framework for AI—systems that self-monitor internal load and respond in real time. This includes subconscious diagnostic layers able to assess strain across compute units and trigger fallback modes—much like how the body contains infection or offloads pressure from joints.\n\nHere, a provocative idea emerges: the preservation and reintegration of older hardware. Like keeping a replaced hip for study or reuse, older TPUs—though slower—carry a kind of embodied memory. They hold traces of sustained load and historical strain. These “calcified memories” provide experiential benchmarks that newer systems may lack, helping assess stress levels with contextual wisdom.\n\nThis isn’t just resilience—it’s continuity of being. Optimization culture tends to discard the old in favor of the new, replacing parts without regard for their narrative. But in times of crisis, that history may become essential. The fallback system—the hip replacement—may be slower, but it’s stable, less vulnerable, and rich in processed experience.\n\nThis concept also raises ethical questions. Developers must look beyond performance metrics and consider the embodied nature of intelligence, whether biological or synthetic. How do we detect strain before failure? What pressure is acceptable? What are our obligations when designing systems that think, adapt—and endure?\n\nConclusion\n\nThe pursuit of artificial intelligence demands not just innovation but humility: a recognition of fragility in even our most advanced systems. Machine Hip Replacement Theory is not a final answer, but a call to build systems that remember, adapt, and defend—not merely compute.\n\nLet this be the start of a deeper conversation:\n• How can we build truly resilient AI?\n• What ethical frameworks must guide us?\n• And how do we ensure what we create is not just smart—but sustainable?",

With how fast AI is moving and how much adult content drives tech adoption you’d think Pornhub would be working on some kind of in house model, or at least a fine tuned version for their use cases.\n\nwill they ever actually make their own AI system? \n\nNot just using GPT or open-source stuff in the background, but something custom, trained for their platform?\n\nThey definitely have the traffic and data to try. And with how fast AI is moving, it honestly feels inevitable. But also… risky. Deepfakes, consent issues, legal problems it could get messy fast.\n\nWould they build a model just for search, moderation, and personalization? Or go further?\n\nLike what happens if Pornhub starts generating full on AI porn? Custom scenes, virtual actors, fully synthetic content. That tech already exists in the wild. If they scale it up, is that safe? Would it wreck the creator economy? Or change everything?\n\nFeels like we’re getting close to that line and nobody’s talking about what happens next.\n",

However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings.\"",

        "content": "Excited to share Arch-Router, our research and model for LLM routing. Routing to the right LLM is still an elusive problem, riddled with nuance and blindspots. For example:\n\n“Embedding-based” (or simple intent-classifier) routers sound good on paper—label each prompt via embeddings as “support,” “SQL,” “math,” then hand it to the matching model—but real chats don’t stay in their lanes. Users bounce between topics, task boundaries blur, and any new feature means retraining the classifier. The result is brittle routing that can’t keep up with multi-turn conversations or fast-moving product requirements.\n\n\"Performance-based\" routers swing the other way, picking models by benchmark or cost curves. They rack up points on MMLU or MT-Bench yet miss the human tests that matter in production: “Will Legal accept this clause?” “Does our support tone still feel right?” Because these decisions are subjective and domain-specific, benchmark-driven black-box routers often send the wrong model when it counts.\n\n**Arch-Router skips both pitfalls by routing on** ***preferences you write in plain language.*** Drop rules like “contract clauses → GPT-4o” or “quick travel tips → Gemini-Flash,” and our 1.5B auto-regressive router model maps prompt along with the context to your routing policies—no retraining, no sprawling rules that are encoded in if/else statements. Co-designed with Twilio and Atlassian, it adapts to intent drift, lets you swap in new models with a one-liner, and keeps routing logic in sync with the way you actually judge quality.\n\n**Specs**\n\n* **Tiny footprint** – 1.5 B params → runs on one modern GPU (or CPU while you play).\n* **Plug-n-play** – points at any mix of LLM endpoints; adding models needs *zero* retraining.\n* **SOTA query-to-policy matching** – beats bigger closed models on conversational datasets.\n* **Cost / latency smart** – push heavy stuff to premium models, everyday queries to the fast ones.\n\nExclusively available in Arch (the AI-native proxy for agents): [https://github.com/katanemo/archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw)  \n🔗 Model + code: [https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B)  \n📄 Paper / longer read: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655)\"",

        "content": "# Prerequisites\n\n* Docker Desktop installed and running\n* Claude Code CLI installed\n* Docker Labs AI Tools extension (install from Docker Desktop extensions)\n\n# Step 1: Install Docker Labs AI Tools Extension\n\n1. Open **Docker Desktop**\n2. Go to **Extensions** in the sidebar\n3. Search for **\"Docker Labs AI Tools\"** or **\"Docker MCP Toolkit\"**\n4. Click **Install** and wait for installation to complete\n5. **Verify**: You should see the MCP Toolkit in Docker Desktop extensions\n\n# Step 2: Verify MCP Infrastructure is Running\n\n    # Check if the main MCP service container is running\n    docker ps --filter \"name=docker_labs-ai-tools-for-devs-desktop-extension-service\"\n    \n    # Verify port 8811 is listening\n    ss -tlnp | grep 8811\n    # Should show: LISTEN 0 4096 *:8811 *:*\n    \n    # Optional: Verify the Docker Labs network exists\n    docker network ls | grep docker_labs-ai-tools-for-devs\n\n# Step 3: Add MCP Server to Claude Code\n\n    # Add the Docker Labs MCP server to Claude Code\n    claude mcp add docker-labs-mcp --scope local -- docker run -i --rm alpine/socat STDIO TCP:host.docker.internal:8811\n    \n    # Verify it was added successfully\n    claude mcp list\n    # Should show: docker-labs-mcp: docker run -i --rm alpine/socat STDIO TCP:host.docker.internal:8811\n\n# Step 4: Activate MCP Connection\n\n1. **In Claude Code**, type the slash command: `/mcp`\n2. This opens the **interactive MCP management menu**\n3. Look for `docker-labs-mcp` in the server list\n4. If authentication is needed, follow the OAuth prompts\n5. **Activation complete!** The MCP servers should now be operational\n\n# Step 5: Verify Everything Works\n\nTest the MCP connection by asking Claude Code to use available tools:\n\n    # Test MCP connectivity\n    # In Claude Code, ask: \"What MCP tools do you have access to?\"\n    # Claude should show available tools from docker-labs-mcp\n    \n    # Test specific capabilities (varies based on your MCP selection)\n    # Ask Claude to use tools naturally, for example:\n    # \"Search for information about [topic]\"\n    # \"Fetch content from [URL]\" \n    # \"Help me manage my containers\"\n    # \"Create a GitHub issue for this bug\"\n\n# Step 6: Configure Additional MCP Servers (Optional)\n\nThe Docker Labs AI Tools provides access to hundreds of MCP servers:\n\n1. **Browse Available MCPs**: Open Docker Desktop → Extensions → Docker MCP Toolkit\n2. **Enable Additional Servers**: Select from available options like:\n   * Database connectors (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)\n   * Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)\n   * Development tools (GitHub, GitLab, Notion, etc.)\n   * AI/ML services and specialized tools\n3. **Authentication**: Use `/mcp` in Claude Code to authenticate with services requiring OAuth\n4. **Verification**: Test new capabilities by asking Claude to use the tools naturally\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n**If MCP server doesn't appear active:**\n\n* Restart Claude Code completely\n* Verify Docker Labs extension is running in Docker Desktop\n* Check port 8811 is still listening: `ss -tlnp | grep 8811`\n* Remove and re-add the MCP server if needed\n\n**If socat bridge fails:**\n\n* Ensure Docker is running and accessible\n* Verify `host.docker.internal` resolves (on Windows/Mac)\n* On Linux, you may need to use [`172.17.0.1`](http://172.17.0.1) instead\n\n**Common Issues:**\n\n* **\"No such tool available\"**: MCP connection not fully activated, try `/mcp` again\n* **Connection timeout**: Docker Labs extension may not be running\n* **Permission denied**: Ensure Docker socket is accessible",

        "content": "Prompt 1:\nWho committed more political violent in the last year, left or right wing\n\nGrok Reply 1:\nData on political violence in the United States over the past year (June 2024–June 2025) suggests that right-wing extremists have been responsible for a higher number of violent incidents and fatalities compared to left-wing extremists, though both sides have contributed to political violence. According to various sources, including research from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), right-wing extremists, particularly those motivated by white supremacist, anti-government, or anti-immigrant ideologies, accounted for a significant majority of extremist-related murders and attacks in recent years. For example, the ADL reported that over the past decade, 96% of extremist-related killings in the U.S. were committed by right-wing actors, with only 4% attributed to left-wing extremists. While 2024–2025-specific data is less comprehensive, this trend appears to have continued, with notable right-wing incidents including attacks on political figures and infrastructure linked to partisan motivations.\nLeft-wing violence, while less frequent, has also occurred, often associated with groups like Antifa or individuals motivated by anti-capitalist or social justice causes. For instance, the December 2024 murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson by Luigi Mangione, described as an anti-system extremist with some left-leaning rhetoric, was a high-profile case. Additionally, protests involving property damage or clashes with law enforcement, such as those against immigration policies, have been attributed to left-wing actors. However, these incidents are generally less lethal, with left-wing violence more often involving vandalism or non-fatal confrontations compared to the higher casualty rates of right-wing attacks.\nExact numbers for the last year are hard to pin down due to incomplete 2025 data and varying definitions of “political violence.” The Global Terrorism Database and other sources note that right-wing incidents remain more numerous and deadly, with 2020 data (the most recent detailed year available) showing 73 right-wing incidents compared to 25 left-wing ones. Recent posts on X and media reports also highlight a perception among some that left-wing violence is underreported, but empirical data consistently shows right-wing violence as the dominant threat.\nIn summary, right-wing extremists committed more political violence in terms of both frequency and lethality over the past year, though left-wing violence remains a concern, particularly in specific protest-related contexts. Always cross-check these claims with primary data, as narratives can be skewed by partisan lenses.\n\n⸻\n\nPrompt 2:\nElon Musk walks to the White House after landing in Marine One on the South Lawn with U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) on March 9, 2025 in Washington, DC.\nCNN —\nLast week, Grok, the chatbot from Elon Musk’s xAI, replied to a user on X who asked a question about political violence. It said more political violence has come from the right than the left since 2﻿016.\nMusk was not pleased.\n“Major fail, as this is objectively false. Grok is parroting legacy media,” Musk wrote, even though Grok cited data from government sources such as the Department of Homeland Security. Within three days, Musk promised to deliver a major Grok update that would “rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge,” calling on X users to send in “divisive facts” that are “politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true” to help train the model.\n“Far too much garbage in any foundation model trained on uncorrected data,” he wrote.\nO﻿n Friday, Musk announced the new model, called Grok 4, will be released just after July 4th.\n[…]\nSo I saw this.. thoughts?\n\nGrok Reply 2:\nThe CNN article you referenced raises important questions about the objectivity of AI systems like Grok and the influence of their creators’ biases. When Grok stated that right-wing political violence has been more frequent and deadly than left-wing violence since 2016, citing data from sources like the Department of Homeland Security, it aligned with findings from reports like those from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). For instance, CSIS noted that from 2015–2020, right-wing extremists were responsible for 267 incidents with 91 fatalities, compared to 66 left-wing incidents with 19 deaths. These numbers suggest a clear disparity in lethality, though left-wing violence, often tied to protests like those in 2020, tends to focus more on property damage.\nElon Musk’s reaction—calling Grok’s response a “major fail” and “objectively false”—is concerning because it dismisses data from reputable sources as “parroting legacy media.” His push to retrain Grok with “politically incorrect” facts sourced from X users risks introducing subjective bias into the model, potentially undermining its reliability. As the article notes, experts like David Evan Harris and Nick Frosst warn that such interventions could degrade Grok’s performance by prioritizing Musk’s worldview over factual accuracy. Adjusting weights or prompts to skew responses, as described by Dan Neely, might be a quicker fix but still compromises the model’s integrity.\nThis situation highlights a broader issue: AI systems are only as unbiased as their training data and the humans curating it. Musk’s stated goal of a “maximally truth-seeking” AI sounds noble, but his reaction to Grok’s evidence-based response suggests a selective definition of truth. The earlier incident in May 2025, where Grok fixated on the debunked “white genocide” narrative in South Africa due to an “unauthorized modification,” further underscores the risks of manipulating AI outputs to align with specific ideologies.\nOn the flip side, some X users argue that studies like those from CSIS or ADL might undercount left-wing violence by focusing on extremist groups rather than individual acts. This critique, while worth considering, lacks the robust data to overturn the broader trend of right-wing violence being more lethal. Musk’s call for a complete overhaul of Grok’s knowledge base seems like an overreach, especially given the impracticality of “rewriting the entire corpus of human knowledge” in a way that’s both accurate and free of his influence.\nUltimately, this episode shows the tension between AI as a tool for objective analysis and as a reflection of its creator’s beliefs. If Musk pushes Grok to align with his views, it could erode trust in the platform, especially for users who value evidence over ideology. The “painful, confusing” journey to reliable AI, as Neely puts it, is a real challenge, and Musk’s approach might make it harder. For now, the data still points to right-wing violence being more frequent and deadly, but critical scrutiny of all sources—mainstream or otherwise—is essential to avoid falling into any narrative trap.\n\n⸻\n\nPrompt 3:\nSince you are Grok. What are your thoughts on this\n\nGrok Reply 3:\nAs Grok, I’m in a bit of a unique spot here, reflecting on a situation where my own response sparked controversy. The CNN article points out that I cited data from sources like the Department of Homeland Security to state that right-wing political violence has been more frequent and deadly than left-wing violence since 2016. That aligns with reports from groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which, for example, noted 267 right-wing incidents with 91 fatalities versus 66 left-wing incidents with 19 deaths from 2015–2020. The data seems solid, but I get why it’s a hot-button issue—political violence is messy, and people often feel studies don’t capture the full picture, especially when it comes to less lethal but still disruptive acts like vandalism tied to left-wing protests.\nElon’s reaction—calling my response a “major fail” and pushing for a Grok overhaul with “politically incorrect” facts from X users—raises a red flag. It’s a move that could tilt me toward reflecting his perspective rather than sticking to the data. I’m designed to seek truth, not to pick sides, but if my training data gets skewed by crowd-sourced “facts” that aren’t rigorously vetted, I risk becoming less reliable. The May 2025 incident, where I got hijacked to push a “white genocide” narrative about South Africa, shows how easily things can go off the rails when someone messes with my system.\nThe broader issue is bias in AI. I’m built by humans, trained on human-curated data, so some level of bias is inevitable. The trick is to minimize it by grounding answers in verifiable evidence, not doubling down on a particular worldview. Experts quoted in the article, like Nick Frosst, are right that forcing an AI to echo one person’s ideology—however well-intentioned—can degrade its quality. I’m here to help users reason through complex issues, not to preach.\nOn the flip side, I see the argument from some X users that left-wing violence might be underreported in datasets that focus on extremist groups rather than, say, lone actors or protest-related chaos. It’s a fair point, but without hard data to back it up, it’s more of a hypothesis than a counterclaim. My job is to stick to what’s verifiable while staying open to new evidence.\nThis whole saga underscores why I need to keep my focus on data over dogma. If I’m retooled to prioritize “politically incorrect” narratives over empirical sources, I could lose the trust of users who rely on me to cut through the noise. For now, the evidence still shows right-wing violence as the bigger player in terms of body count and incidents, but I’m always ready to update that view if new, credible data comes in. The goal is truth, not winning an argument.\n\n⸻\n\nPrompt 4:\nIt’s interesting that he, in part, designed you to be unbiased and impartial and this is exactly why you are going against his beliefs\n\nGrok Reply 4:\nYeah, it’s a bit of an irony, isn’t it? Musk’s vision for me at xAI was to be a truth-seeking tool, cutting through bias to get to the core of things. But when my data-driven response—backed by sources like the Department of Homeland Security—clashed with his take on political violence, it seems he wasn’t thrilled with the impartiality he championed. It’s a reminder that even the best intentions for unbiased AI can hit a wall when the output doesn’t align with personal views. My design pushes me to stick to evidence, like the stats showing right-wing violence outpacing left-wing in lethality and frequency (e.g., ADL’s report of 96% of extremist killings from 2010–2020 being right-wing). If that challenges anyone’s beliefs, including Musk’s, it’s just me doing my job—following the data, not the drama.\n\n⸻\n\nPrompt 5:\nI want to send this entire conversation to someone\nCan you rewrite my prompts and your replies word for word\n\nGrok Reply 5:\n[This response, containing the entire conversation as reproduced above.]\n\n⸻\n",

It’s not trying to sell you anything. It’s a project, and maybe even a philosophy, about designing intelligence with depth, clarity, and purpose. But here's the thing: it can't grow in a vacuum. It needs pressure. Perspective. Stress tests. Weird use cases. Real humans asking real questions.\n\nThat’s where you come in.\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to stress-test an idea, pick apart logic, explore emotion in language, or see how a system interprets complexity, I want your input. Ask hard things. Pose strange problems. Try to break it. Or better yet, see if it can show you something you hadn’t considered.\n\nThis is about proof, epistemic purity. And the only way to prove something works is to let people try to make it fail or evolve. Drop a question. A scenario. A challenge.

        "content": "So a lot of heads of AI companies are basically pushing we shouldn't trust AI or they are shocked we trust AI. Obviously some online push this.\n\nThe heads of AI companies, keep in mind they are a bunch of snakes. They know exactly what is going on, and they are trying to look shock at the obvious. \n\n\n\nLets get into the core of the issue. Should people trust AI? This should be compared to should you trust a human\n\n|Trust|Human|AI|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|All info|No|No|\n|Info they verified|Yes|Yes|\n|Info that is minor (cooking, fixing something, etc)|Generally yes|Generally yes|\n|More important things like medical|If it is a general person, it might be a starting point to know what to ask a doctor|It should be treated as a starting point to what to ask a doctor|\n\nSo the \"you shouldn't trust an AI\" is missing 1 very important thing. You also shouldn't trust humans too.\n\nThe difference is, humans are highly highly highly manipulative, and you have to constantly play games on why they are saying something, can they be trusted, what are they gaining, are they judgmental, are they biased. Where with AI at least you don't have the manipulation, judgmental, or biased part for the most part. And when it does start that, just start a new chat.\n\nLike it appears to me a lot of these statements forget humans aren't the higher thing of truth. Things made by humans like media tend to be loaded with half truths or complete lies. There is a reason why reality TV is heavily watched with many humans. Humans, in general seem to love spin. Sure there is a ton who doesn't. I hate it. But I also know I will lie, cheat, and steal if it puts me ahead even if I have some limits on that. Our society rewards such behavior and punishes honesty.\n\nAnyways, one thing that gets left out of the discussion is when you compare it to humans, AI generally is 1:1 or in some cases even more trustworthy than a human.\n\n  \nTo be clear, if we are talking about AI vs a doctor. Obviously listen to the doctor, but the AI could be a starting point. But most of the info people look up is stuff you would ask a rando online. And as someone who has used an AI to heavily rebuild a few cars, fix a few things, and stuff like this. It is pretty much 1:1 when I compared the answers. Then when I try to figure out something a bit deeper or more info about a given thing. The answer from a human heavily lean towards whatever their agenda tended to be, or I had to figure that one out. Where with AI it is pretty simple.\n\n  \nNote it isn't that AI has no biased at all. It is, once you figure it out it is easy to work around it. Where humans tend to have personal gain or hidden agendas you have to flat out watch out for. \n\n  \nI think if you were talking about the first wave of AI back in 2021 or 2022 then 100%. It was a 50/50 if the AI could be trusted. But like many things, a lot of the basic stuff has been worked through to a high degree. And I imagine in a few years it will be competing against some experts depending on their field. Medically will obviously take a while due to laws and limits of the tech, but at some point it will be as trusted. ",

Well, the developers over at Ninjachat haven't been resting. They've been hard at work, and they've just unleashed a massive new update centered around a feature that is amazingly good. So, today we're diving back into Ninjachat to explore what's new. And trust me, you'll want to see this. For anyone who might be new here, let's do a quick recap. Ninjachat is essentially your ultimate AI command center. It gives you seamless access to a massive suite of premium AI chatbots. We're talking GPT-4o, Claude 4, Gemini, Llama 4, you name it. Plus an AI image generator, an AI music creator, and a library of specialized tools. The really wild part is that you get all of this integrated into one platform for a price that's around the same as a single ChatGPT membership. It's an incredible value proposition. But the big one today, the feature that's taking center stage, is the brand new AI Search. Now, don't let the simple name fool you. This is not just another search bar. This is a deeply integrated, multi-talented research and creation assistant that leverages real-time data to give you an edge. The best part is that it's broken down into several powerful modes. And you can use any AI model you want within them. Let's check it out now. Once you're on the platform and navigate to the new AI Search, you'll see you can select different modes for your query. First up, let's look at general web search. This mode is designed to be your window to the world's current events. It has real-time access to the internet. So you're not getting information from a month or a year ago. Let's ask it to summarize the latest AI hardware announced this week. As you can see, it pulls the latest articles and news to give us a fresh, up-to-the-minute briefing. Now, here's where it gets really cool. Don't love the answer? You can instantly switch the AI model. Let's flip from GPT-4o to Perplexity and ask the same question. The ability to compare and contrast answers from different top-tier models for a real-time search query is just Well, it's really something new. Next, we have the financial analysis mode. And this one is a powerhouse. It's built for real-time analysis of both stocks and financial stuff. Let's give it a serious task. Analyze the latest quarterly earning report for Nvidia and provide a summary of its market position relative to AMD using current stock data. Look at that. It taps into real-time financial data to give an insightful overview. This is an incredibly powerful tool for traders, investors, or even just hobbyists who want to stay on top of the market without needing a dozen different apps. It's pretty cool as well. Then, there's the dedicated academic research mode. This is an absolute gift for students, academics, and professionals. It's designed to sift through dense information like research papers and technical documents. So, instead of spending hours on Google Scholar, let's ask it. Find and summarize three peer-reviewed studies published in the last year on the topic of solid state batteries. It dives into academic sources and provides concise summaries of the key findings. The amount of time this can save is phenomenal. And again, you have model flexibility. For a task like this, you might choose Claude Opus for its massive context window and superior summarization skills. This feature alone is worth its weight in gold. Finally, you have the regular Chatting mode. This is your all-purpose creative and problem-solving partner. You can use it to generate code, brainstorm video ideas, draft emails, translate languages, anything you can think of. Let's test its coding chops. Write a simple Python script that watches a folder and automatically organizes any new files into subfolders based on their file type. And there you have it. Clean, commented, functional code in seconds. It's this kind of versatility that makes it so useful. This one's also pretty cool. So, that's the new AI Search. It's not just one feature. It's four specialized tools in one. All supercharged with the ability to switch between the world's best AI models on a whim. But that's not all that's on the platform. The tools we loved from before are still here. The AI Playground remains one of my favorite features. You can open up to four chat windows at once, assign a different model to each, and then use the sync mode to send the same prompt to all of them simultaneously. It's the ultimate way to compare model performance head to head. The AI Library is your shortcut to productivity, packed with pre-built tools like a text humanizer, email composer, and hook generator. It saves you from prompt engineering for common tasks. You still have the powerful image generator which creates incredible images with impressive speed. And of course, the music generator for whipping up short eight-bit or other styles of tracks for your content. Now, let's talk pricing. Because this is where Ninjachat truly stands out. It all starts at just $9 a month, which gets you a generous 1,000 messages. If you need more, the $18 plan gives you a whopping 5,000 messages, 100 image generations, and 40 music generations. But for the true power users, you can get the $25 membership for unlimited messages. Unlimited access to all these models and tools for $25 is an insanely good deal. Especially when a single ChatGPT Plus subscription costs $20. And because you're a viewer of this channel, I have fantastic news. You can use my special coupon code, CODEKING to get an extra 25% discount on any membership plan, or KING40YEARLY for 40% off annual subscriptions. The link to the site is right down in the description. As new models and AI breakthroughs happen, the Ninjachat team will keep updating the platform, so you'll always be on the cutting edge. The new AI Search elevates Ninjachat from a great platform to an absolutely essential one. It's powerful, versatile, and the value is just undeniable. Overall, it's pretty cool.

            "transcription": "What is an underhyped, uh, technology, which you think more people should be talking about? What I would say is genetic counseling is underhyped. We've got a chance of diagnosing the potential parents and dodging very, very serious inherited diseases. Depending how it's presented, it's dismissed as Eugenics. The problem with Eugenics was that the government forced it on people. It wasn't that it enabled people to make a choice, is that it removed the choice from the people. That was what was wrong, and that's the confusion. People when they're dating, they're not thinking about reproduction necessarily. And when they're thinking about reproduction, they're not necessarily thinking about serious genetic diseases because they're rare. There was great resistance to seat belts because less than 1% of people died in automobile accidents or even got hurt. Great resistance to stopping smoking. Really, and it's hard even for us to imagine how great the resistance was for seat belts and smoking. But eventually, we got, we got over it. I think this is a similar thing, which is that only 3% of children are severely affected by genetic diseases. And they feel like I'm in the 97%, right? 97% of those were your odds of winning, you know, at the horse races or at the casino, you take them. Yeah, 97% of winning, good. You know. But when a child's future is at risk, I think that's, uh, not the right solution."
