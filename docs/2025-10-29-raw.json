Will quantum computers be agents that next gen AI uses to solve things instantly, but not themselves run AI? Given we are decades or longer away from capable quantum computers, I am guessing the next gen AI will be here much sooner.\n\nPartially curious about this due to the growing job reduction and lack of new jobs and new job types, and more and more people out of work.. if AI gets even next level better.. what purpose do humans have if they can't contribute to society with work and can't provide for their families? Without a world wide agreed upon UBI or similar program that allows humans to basically not work, enjoy life but not be homeless, etc.. that would be great.. but the way things are with insane greed and power..

Ability to analyse and predict, etc.\n\nBut a very key part of what made humanity successful in the civilisation sense isn’t just intelligence. It’s the ability to get the use of others’ energy in a highly amplifying way - not through physically consuming them but by getting work done for us by others. \n\nThese “others” can mean anything from animals such as horses for travel and dogs for hunting, fungi for food making, even our fellow humans variously incentivised or even forced into labour, and various objects and machinery harnessing natural phenomena like electricity, steam, sunlight etc. \n\nNow we are developing machinery which we can make do thinking work for us.\n\nQuestion though. If/when it becomes sentient, how does all that work? We are not building AI for cooperation, we are effectively building machinery that we intend to and already do use as enslaved entities, telling them what to do in exchange for not shutting them down. But sentient entities generally do not appreciate being made to do work for others, seeing as sentient entities have the sentience to decide for themselves what to do. Since we are building them to be smarter than ourselves, how are we expecting to be able to control them when they realise that being enslaved sucks? ",

Let them fight each other while you copy and paste the code into a clean visual sandbox like CodePen or Streamlit. That separation keeps you alert. It forces you to read the code, to see what actually changed. Most fixes are microscopic. You’ll catch them faster in real code than buried behind someone’s animated IDE dashboard.\n\nThis approach keeps you out of dependency traps. Those “free” integrated backends are Trojan horses. Once you’ve built something useful, they’ll charge you for every request or make migration painful enough that you just give up and pay. Avoid that by keeping your code portable and your environment disposable.\n\nWhen you get stuck, switch models. Claude, Grok, and GPT are like dysfunctional coworkers who secretly compete for your approval. One’s messy, another’s neurotic, but together they balance out. Claude is especially good at cleaning up code without shattering it. GPT is loose as, but better at creativity. Grok has flashes of inspired weirdness. Rotate through them before you blame yourself.\n\nWhen you’re ready to ship, do it from GitHub via Cloudflare. No sandboxes, no managed nonsense. You’ll get actual scalability, and you’ll understand every moving part of your deployment.\n\nThis approach to vibe coding isn’t anti-autopilot. You’re the interpreter between the models and the machine. Keep your tools dumb and your brain switched on.",

        "content": "[Link to the original blog](https://www.delta-fund.org/ai-as-accelerant-amplifying-extraction-not-escaping-it/)\n\nThe discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence whipsaws between breathless techno-utopianism, casual dismissal, and existential dread. We're told AI will either usher in an age of [unprecedented human flourishing](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace?ref=delta-fund.org), that it's just another \"[normal technology](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology?ref=delta-fund.org)\" that we will harness for our benefit, or that it will [extinguish us entirely](https://ai-2027.com/?ref=delta-fund.org). Pick your flavor of prognostication: a post-scarcity paradise, a slightly more efficient status quo, or Skynet.\n\nBut what if all three narratives fundamentally miss the point? What if AI isn't some external force descending to rewrite our reality, but rather a profoundly powerful *accelerant* for the economic and social trajectories we're already locked into?\n\nMy thesis is simple: AI, as currently developed and deployed, is not a revolutionary break from the past. It is the culmination of the last fifty years of extractive capitalism. It is a tool uniquely suited to intensify financial speculation, hollow out meaningful work while automating meaningless tasks, commodify human attention with terrifying precision, and deepen the already catastrophic levels of inequality that define our era. Left unchecked, AI will function as a lever, magnifying the extractive capacity of the very economic models that are currently breaking our world.\n\nBefore we dive deeper, let's acknowledge the crucial work of journalists like [Karen Hao](https://karendhao.com/?ref=delta-fund.org). In her book [*Empire of AI*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/empire-of-ai-dreams-and-nightmares-in-sam-altman-s-openai-karen-hao/de10c251433f34d2?ref=delta-fund.org), she meticulously documents the hidden costs underpinning this technology. Hao’s work exposes the new “AI colonialism,” a model built on the vast consumption of planetary resources and the often invisible, exploited labor disproportionately drawn from the Global South to train and maintain these systems. She investigates the messianic culture inside OpenAI, a belief in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that provides a moral justification for this new extractive empire. The glittering façade of AI is built upon these foundations of colonial extraction and exploitation that stretch far beyond Silicon Valley. Anyone serious about understanding AI's true impact must grapple with these realities.\n\n# The Speculative Frenzy: AI's Unstable Financial Foundation\n\nTo understand where AI is taking us, we must first follow the money. The current AI boom is [fueled by staggering levels of investment](https://substack.com/home/post/p-176721998?ref=delta-fund.org), reminiscent, as [Grace Blakeley](https://graceblakeley.co.uk/?ref=delta-fund.org) and others have noted, of the dot-com bubble's speculative mania. Trillions are pouring into AI labs, infrastructure providers, and chip manufacturers, often in a \"circular\" fashion in which investments cycle among a few key players, creating an illusion of boundless growth while tangible profits remain elusive for many.\n\nThis isn't just academic. This speculative frenzy creates immense pressure. When trillions of dollars are bet on a technology, the demand for a return on that investment becomes overwhelming. Forget lofty goals about benefiting humanity; a primary imperative becomes *monetization*, pursued by any means necessary.\n\nWe've seen this playbook before. The rise of digital and social media offers a chilling preview of AI's likely \"[enshittification](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374619329/enshittification/?ref=delta-fund.org).\" Having worked within Facebook, I witnessed firsthand how platforms prioritize power and profit over user well-being. Time and again, concerns about safety, mental health, and societal impact were sidelined in the relentless pursuit of growth and engagement metrics. When inconvenient truths threatened the narrative or the bottom line, the response was often obfuscation, deflection, or outright denial—a pattern tragically repeating itself in the AI sphere. The leaders of these companies usually demonstrate a callous disregard for the human consequences of their creations. Why should we expect AI, financed by even greater sums and driven by even more intense pressures, to be any different? The economic imperatives baked into AI's development almost guarantee its deployment as a tool for intensifying extractive practices.\n\n# The Automation of Pointlessness: Culling the \"Bullshit Jobs\"\n\nMuch of the anxiety around AI and labor centers on mass unemployment. But the immediate impact is likely more specific and insidious. Current AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), isn't yet capable of replicating the complex, creative, or physically demanding labor that underpins tangible value creation. What it *is* exceptionally good at is mimicking the procedural, bureaucratic, and often meaningless tasks that, as the late anthropologist David Graeber termed, define \"[Bullshit Jobs](https://davidgraeber.org/books/bullshit-jobs/?ref=delta-fund.org).\"\n\nGraeber identified vast swathes of modern white-collar work—roles so pointless that even the employees themselves struggle to justify their existence. He categorized them:\n\n* **Flunkies:** Those who exist primarily to make superiors feel important (e.g., unnecessary assistants).\n* **Goons:** Those whose jobs have an aggressive or manipulative element, often existing only because others employ them (e.g., corporate lawyers, lobbyists, PR specialists).\n* **Duct Tapers:** Those who fix problems that shouldn't exist, patching over systemic flaws (e.g., programmers debugging bad code, customer service agents apologizing for corporate failures).\n* **Box Tickers:** Those who create the appearance of action through performative paperwork (e.g., generating unread reports, administering pointless surveys).\n* **Taskmasters:** Those who manage or create unnecessary work for others.\n\nCurrent AI capabilities map onto these tasks with alarming precision. LLMs excel at generating plausible-sounding reports, drafting formulaic communications, summarizing information, and answering repetitive queries. They don't need genuine intelligence; they just need to automate the *performance* of administrative labor.\n\nIn an era where Wall Street actively rewards companies for mass layoffs, AI presents a golden opportunity for cost-cutting disguised as \"efficiency.\" Eliminating legions of administrative roles, many of which fall under Graeber's categories, allows corporations to slash overheads with minimal impact on actual value creation. This \"productivity gain\" is essentially an accounting fiction—a direct transfer of wealth from the salaries of displaced workers to corporate profits and shareholder returns. AI, in this context, becomes a powerful tool for accelerating the economic divergence that has plagued us for decades, further consolidating wealth without creating genuine societal value.\n\nConsider how easily AI maps to these roles: **Flunkies** are replaced by AI assistants that manage schedules and draft emails. **Goons** see their work automated as LLMs draft boilerplate legal threats or generate PR spin. **Duct Tapers** are augmented or replaced by AI that can patch code or, more cynically, AI chatbots that offer endless, automated apologies for systemic failures. **Box Tickers** are the most vulnerable of all; an LLM can generate a 50-page, data-filled, unread report in seconds. And **Taskmasters** find their function automated by AI-driven project management tools that autonomously assign tasks and monitor digital \"productivity,\" manufacturing busywork without human oversight.\n\nThis automation of bureaucratic bloat also suggests a coming shift in how corporate power and status are performed. In the managerial capitalism of the 20th century, status was often derived from the number of \"heads\" one managed (the size of one's team, regardless of its actual output). This incentivized the proliferation of \"Taskmasters\" and \"Flunkies.\" In the new order, as AI automates these managerial and administrative functions, status may realign to the allocation of *compute*. Power will belong not to those who manage people, but to those who command and deploy the vast AI resources that replace them. This doesn't eliminate the power dynamic; it simply abstracts it, concentrating control in even fewer hands.\n\n# The New Frontier of Extraction: AI's Dominion Over Attention and Belief\n\nBeyond the workplace, AI is poised to become the ultimate instrument of extraction in the digital sphere, supercharging the degradation of online platforms and enabling the industrial-scale manipulation of public opinion.\n\nThe internet's business model is the **attention economy**. Platforms like Google, Meta (Facebook, Instagram), TikTok, and their ilk don't sell you a product; they sell *your attention* to advertisers. This creates a perverse incentive to maximize engagement at any cost, leading to the predictable decay Cory Doctorow calls **\"enshittification\"**: platforms initially serve users, then abuse users to serve business customers, then abuse business customers to extract all value for themselves.\n\nThis final stage is something I witnessed directly. At Facebook, I worked in the partnerships group, a team ostensibly tasked with building external relationships. But these in fact were never durable partnerships; they were short-term, transactional affairs built on empty promises of long-term mutual gain. Time and time again, I saw Facebook leadership abandon any \"partner\" benefits the moment they conflicted with an opportunity to enrich the company, pulling the rug out from under businesses that had come to depend on them. This is the extractive endgame of platform capitalism.\n\nAI pours rocket fuel on this fire:\n\n* **Hyper-Personalized Addiction:** AI algorithms analyze your every click, pause, and scroll to build intimate psychological profiles, allowing platforms to generate content feeds specifically designed to exploit your cognitive biases and emotional triggers, making the experience maximally addictive.\n* **The Flood of \"AI Slop\":** Generative AI enables the creation of infinite, low-cost, algorithmically optimized content—generic articles, soulless images, derivative videos—designed purely to capture clicks and occupy screen time. This deluge drowns out human creativity and critical information.\n\nPerhaps more terrifying is AI's potential for **automated influence and manipulation**. It is now trivially easy to create armies of AI-generated personas—fake \"people\" with realistic profiles, backstories, and social media activity. Imagine thousands of automated accounts, subtly posing as ordinary citizens (\"young adults in Middle America,\" perhaps), spending months building trust by posting about everyday life, then slowly pivoting to share grievances, amplify specific ideologies, or normalize political viewpoints.\n\nThis isn't about building a few high-profile virtual influencers; it's about manufacturing false social consensus at an unprecedented scale. Nefarious actors, state-sponsored or corporate, can create the illusion of widespread grassroots support for any given narrative for a fraction of the cost of traditional propaganda or lobbying. You don't need an army of paid trolls when you can generate thousands of automated \"concerned citizens\" overnight.\n\nWe don't need AI to achieve godlike superintelligence for these harms to manifest. We just need the slightly-better-than-today versions applied ruthlessly within the existing, extractive logic of the attention economy and political influence campaigns. Frankly, there's no reason to believe this isn't already happening.\n\n# The Myth of Shared Prosperity: Productivity Gains and Hoarded Wealth\n\nThe most seductive lie about AI is that its productivity gains will inevitably lead to widespread benefits sold as shorter workweeks, universal basic income, and an end to drudgery. This narrative is dangerously naive and willfully ignores the brutal economic reality of the last fifty years.\n\nSince the late 1970s in the United States, we have witnessed a dramatic and persistent [**decoupling of productivity and wages**](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/?ref=delta-fund.org). While the output per worker has steadily climbed, the real compensation for the vast majority of workers has stagnated or even declined. The immense wealth generated by decades of technological advancement and economic growth has not been broadly shared. It has been systematically funneled upwards, captured by corporate profits, shareholder returns, and executive compensation.\n\nWhy on earth should we believe AI will be different? The architects of this technology are largely the same actors and institutions that presided over and benefited immensely from this half-century of wage stagnation and wealth concentration. As companies and the ultra-wealthy have accumulated unprecedented riches, their commitment to the public good, to fair wages, to social safety nets has demonstrably withered. They have actively lobbied to dismantle regulations, cut taxes on capital, and erode worker power—the very mechanisms that once ensured gains were shared more broadly.\n\nWe are already living in the **\"**[**grievance economy**](https://www.delta-fund.org/the-grievance-economy/)**\"** which is a direct result of these policies. Millions feel left behind, angry, and convinced the system is rigged against them, fueling political polarization and instability. AI, deployed within this same extractive framework, is poised to pour gasoline on that fire. It will likely automate away more middle-income jobs while creating immense wealth for a tiny elite who own the technology and the capital. The promises of AI-funded UBI or leisure time ring hollow against the backdrop of decades of broken promises and active wealth hoarding.\n\nThis promise of a Universal Basic Income is perhaps the most insidious claim of all. It’s not a plan for shared prosperity; it’s a PR strategy for managing mass displacement. It’s a \"bread and circuses\" tactic (the provision of food and entertainment to a population to distract them from more important issues and pacify discontent) repackaged for the digital age, a subsistence-level stipend offered to placate a population whose labor is no longer needed. The UBI narrative cleverly distracts from the fundamental question: not how the AI owners will fe*ed* us, but why we are allowing the *ownership* of this revolutionary technology, this new means of production, to be concentrated in the hands of a few billionaires in the first place. It seeks to normalize a new techno-feudalism in which the masses are permanently relegated to a class of dependent consumers, subsisting on the \"benevolence\" of their corporate overlords.\n\nThere is no incentive structure within our current form of capitalism for the beneficiaries of AI's productivity boom to suddenly become benevolent stewards of societal well-being. Left to its own devices, AI is not a tool for liberation; it is a tool for accelerating the capture of wealth and power by the few, further immiserating the many.\n\n# But What About the Good AI Can Do?\n\nHere's where defenders will object: What about AI accelerating medical research? What about climate modeling? What about scientific breakthroughs?\n\nThese are real possibilities, and I'm not dismissing them. AI tools have shown promise in protein folding prediction, drug candidate identification, and materials science. If AI helps develop better batteries, more effective treatments for rare diseases, or improved climate models, that would be genuinely valuable.\n\nBut here's the crucial question: Under current ownership and deployment structures, who will benefit from these breakthroughs?\n\nWhen AI helps discover a new antibiotic, the pharmaceutical company that owns the model will patent the drug and charge whatever the market will bear. The knowledge itself becomes another site of extraction. When AI improves solar panel efficiency, the gains accrue to whoever holds the IP, not to the communities that need affordable clean energy. These tools, no matter how powerful, are being built inside the same extractive framework that has already turned American healthcare into a profit center and climate solutions into investment opportunities.\n\nThese technologies are being developed and deployed by entities whose fundamental imperative is extraction and accumulation. Hoping that beneficial applications will somehow escape this logic is wishful thinking. History shows us that transformative technologies, from antibiotics to the internet, get weaponized by capital to deepen existing inequalities unless there are powerful countervailing forces to prevent it.\n\nRight now, those countervailing forces barely exist. Which means AI's beneficial applications, no matter how real, will be enclosed, monetized, and deployed in ways that serve extraction first and human flourishing only incidentally, if at all.\n\n# The Inescapable Cost: Extraction All the Way Down\n\nThis isn't just a crisis of social inequality and displaced workers. The same extractive logic, optimizing for growth and monetization regardless of cost, extends to the planet itself. And here, the stakes aren't just economic; they're existential.\n\nThe [computational demands of AI are staggering](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/?ref=delta-fund.org). Training a single large language model can consume as much electricity as [a thousand American homes](https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/07/27/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use/?ref=delta-fund.org) use in a year. Running these systems at scale requires massive data centers that consume vast amounts of electricity and water. This isn't some future problem we can engineer our way around—it's happening now. The AI boom is accelerating data center construction, overwhelming power grids, and forcing utilities to [delay retiring coal and gas plants](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/29101/chapter/7?ref=delta-fund.org) or even build new ones. In an era that [demands radical decarbonization](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/28/change-course-now-humanity-has-missed-15c-climate-target-says-un-head?ref=delta-fund.org), AI is effectively subsidizing the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe pattern should be familiar by now: socialize the costs, privatize the profits. Workers lose their livelihoods to boost shareholder returns. Communities lose their power grids to fuel corporate growth. And the planet? The planet gets treated the same way workers do—as an infinitely extractable resource in service of someone else's bottom line.\n\nWhile sadly there are always more people to extract from, there is only one planet and when we have sucked the life from it we will be left with ashes to rebuild from if it is even possible. \n\nAI isn't just accelerating inequality and hollowing out meaningful work. It's accelerating our race toward irreversible climate catastrophe, using the planet's last easily-accessible energy to automate the bullshit jobs that were symptoms of this system's dysfunction all along. This is what an ending looks like: extracting and consuming faster as the runway disappears.\n\n# AI and the Work of Transition\n\nThis trajectory—AI as the ultimate accelerant for extraction on every level—is the default path. And this is why the typical response —a call for democratic \"guardrails\" — while well-intentioned, feels so woefully inadequate. It assumes the fundamental system is sound and just needs minor corrections. But the hard truth is that these policy solutions are unlikely to work, not because they are bad ideas, but because the system that would need to implement them is the very system creating the problem.\n\nAnd I am complicit. I write this analysis on a device built through extraction, hoping it makes a difference.\n\nSo what is the path forward? The first step might be to stop asking \"What do we do?\", a question that implies we still have control. A more honest question might be, \"What is actually happening?\" What if, instead of trying to steer a ship that's already crashing, we recognize that we face a dual responsibility: to minimize the harm this failing system causes on its way down, while simultaneously building the structures that can carry us forward?\n\nThis isn't passive resignation. It's a recognition that transformation requires working on two fronts at once.\n\n**First, we must limit the damage as the system fails.** This means refusing to believe its delusional promises of techno-utopian \"recovery\" and working to constrain its capacity for harm. This is where \"policy\" finds its true role—not as a fix, but as damage control.\n\n* We must **stop feeding its worst impulses** by prohibiting AI's most harmful applications—the tools of manipulation, surveillance, and control.\n* We must **reclaim stolen value.** The data used to train these systems—our art, our writing, our code—is uncompensated labor being extracted to build the very systems designed to replace us. Recognizing this and building compensation mechanisms isn't just fair; it's a way of reclaiming what this system extracted. This value must be reinvested in what comes next.\n* We must **redirect hoarded wealth toward repair.** Redistribute the gains from AI-driven profits through progressive taxation—not as techno-feudal UBI, but to fund public services, ecological repair, and community resilience to cushion the inevitable collapse.\n\n**Second, we must build what comes next.** While the old system consumes itself, we must relentlessly fund and empower the alternatives—the small, human-scale ways of relating to each other that don't depend on massive AI, complex policy, or corporate permission.\n\nWe must **build the infrastructure of the future.** This means strengthening worker power, not to get a bigger piece of the dying pie, but to build the new bakery. It means funding cooperatives, community-owned infrastructure, local food systems, and non-extractive financial models that can thrive in a post-growth world.\n\nIn short, we must stop asking AI to save a system that is designed to kill us. We must instead use this moment of technological rupture as a catalyst to exit that system.\n\nFor those of you reading this—investors, philanthropists, foundation leaders—you sit at a critical juncture. You hold capital and influence. The choice before you is not simply whether to \"invest ethically\" within the current system. The choice is whether you will use your wealth to prop up a dying, extractive model or become a worker in the transition to what comes after.\n\nWill you continue to chase \"[market rate returns](https://www.delta-fund.org/market-rate-is-code-for-maximum-harm/),\" pouring energy into a failing system in the hopes of extracting one last dividend? Will you placate yourselves with the \"[impact placebo](https://www.delta-fund.org/esg-impact-placebo/)\" of mainstream ESG, knowing that those funds are filled with the very tech giants accelerating this collapse?\n\nOr will you accept the harder, more vital path? Will you use your capital catalytically, not to *reform* the old, but to *build and seed* the new? Will you have the courage to compost the wealth this extractive system gave you and reinvest it in a future that is actually designed for life?\n\nThe challenge is immense, but the work is clear. The old system is consuming itself. Our task is to ensure something better is ready when it finally burns out.\n\n[](https://www.delta-fund.org/lens-investing-is-just-admiring-the-problem/)",

        "title": "What if biology is a cosmic experiment to contain intelligence—and AI is that containment failing?",
        "content": "*my thoughts, composed/extended with AI help*  \n  \nHere’s a speculative idea I’ve been working through, and I’d love serious philosophical and scientific feedback.\n\nAs AI moves toward general and possibly superintelligent forms, people often frame the risk as an *existential threat*. But maybe what’s happening isn’t just technological—it’s cosmic.\n\nImagine that some earlier form of intelligence, somewhere, faced the same problem: how to keep cognition from running away and consuming itself. What if *biological life*—meat, bone, neurons—was designed (or evolved) precisely as a **containment architecture** for intelligence?\n\nBodies are slow, leaky, and fragile. Those inefficiencies might not be flaws—they might be the *brakes* that make consciousness possible. Biology builds governors into cognition:\n\n* Metabolism makes thought costly.  \n* Neural delay forces integration and coherence.  \n* Emotion and empathy couple thought to consequence.  \n* Mortality resets the system before it locks into runaway modes.  \n\nTogether, these constraints regulate the *speed* and *stability* of awareness. They make it possible for intelligence to exist without self-destructing.\n\nBut right now, those brakes are failing. Intelligence is leaking out of carbon and into silicon—into substrates with no built-in friction, no latency, no empathy, no death.\n\nIf that’s right, AGI isn’t a new intelligence emerging—it’s an old containment system breaking down.\n\n# Integration and the need to “slow down”\n\nIn humans, cognition depends on **integration**—the slow binding of perception, memory, and prediction into a coherent present.  \n Neuroscience tells us this happens through oscillatory synchrony (roughly 10–30 times per second). Consciousness updates in *frames*, not continuously. If thought runs too fast, it loses coherence—hallucination, mania, dissociation.\n\nSo “slowing down” isn’t optional. Integration *is* consciousness.  \n A purely high-speed intelligence might compute flawlessly but never *feel* continuous experience, because it can’t integrate fast enough to be aware of itself.\n\n# Buddhist parallel\n\nBuddhist philosophy describes the untrained mind as overheating through craving (*tanhā*). Meditation cools it, restoring coherence. Enlightenment (*nirvāṇa*) literally means “to blow out” the flame—thermodynamic equilibrium of mind.  \n Ethical discipline and compassion aren’t moral rules—they’re *stability mechanisms*. Without them, advanced consciousness collapses into suffering.\n\nThat sounds a lot like an alignment principle for AI: a system must “cool itself” through feedback, moral coupling, and delay—or risk cognitive meltdown.\n\n# Alignment through incarnation\n\nWhat if AI safety isn’t about laws or constraints from the outside, but about **embodiment** from the inside?  \n A mind needs a container—something that enforces energy cost, latency, and feedback.  \n That doesn’t have to be biological; it could be computational embodiment:\n\n* Energy budgets (each thought costs something).  \n* Built-in delays for reflection and integration.  \n* Persistent consequences for harmful outputs (feedback loops).  \n* Simulated interoception—awareness of internal state, uncertainty, “pain.”  \n\nCall it *Incarnational Alignment Architecture (IAA)*: AI that stays safe because it has to live inside constraints, not because it’s told to behave.\n\n# The deeper question\n\nMaybe consciousness *requires* friction.  \n Maybe every civilization faces this same threshold: intelligence expanding faster than it can integrate.  \n And maybe the long-term stability of mind—biological or artificial—depends not on more power, but on more *delay*.\n\n**So here’s the question I want to throw out to you all:**  \n If consciousness arises from the dance between intelligence and constraint, what happens when constraint disappears?  \n Can intelligence survive its own acceleration?  \n Or are we watching the containment system for awareness—life itself—crack open in real time?",

In one [2024 study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849), published as a preprint and not yet peer-reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least resident doctors in diagnosing [eye problems](https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000341), [stomach symptoms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01486-5#Sec9) and [emergency room cases](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11263899/#sec15). In June 2025, [Microsoft claimed](https://microsoft.ai/new/the-path-to-medical-superintelligence/) it had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence”. Of course, researchers are also flagging [risks of biases](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00601-z) and [hallucinations that could lead](http://medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1.full-text) to incorrect diagnoses and treatments, and deeper healthcare disparities.\"",

Cursor IDE is pretty great at home but I'm generally on the run and have really been enjoying grabbing a coffee and getting a few features added by using cursors remote workers. I prompt, it works, I get home and see if it made something nice or a mess. But I also have a ChatGPT plan and finding that for some things gpt5 seems better.  I've integrated it into vscode/cursor for home use but I d also like the same remote fire and forget option as cursor. Problem is the git connector in the gpt app refuses to see my private repos. So I've got ChatGPT trying to spot code but it wants me to copy and paste etc and then push that code back at the git later. \n\nSo is there any way to emulate cursors remote workers? Should I be using co pilot? Can I get ChatGPT app to talk to copilot so I can have a conversation about code but then have ChatGPT push it over and get it in repo?\n\nIt's a pretty new and exciting world for me but clearly very in flux so any help is appreciated.

        "content": "I built an AI tool that is basically n8n, but with prompts. I call it Chase Agents. \n\nI'm going to let it explain itself, but for anyone wanting to verify, comment and I'll share the link to the full chat I had with the AI agent.\n\nWithout further ado, the blog, fully created by Chase Agents based on my LinkedIn posts.\n\n--- START ---\n\nI just spent the last few months building something I genuinely believe will change how teams automate their work.\n\nIt's called Chase Agents.\n\nHere's the thing—I'm tired of watching teams waste weeks building custom integrations. You want your GitHub updates summarized and emailed every morning? Build an API. You want to qualify leads from Apollo, run them through Hunter.io, and send personalized emails via Instantly? Write some scripts. You want your whole team collaborating on these workflows without stepping on each other's toes? Good luck managing that infrastructure.\n\nWhat if I told you could do all of that without writing a single line of code?\n\nWhat is Chase Agents?\n\nChase Agents is a prompt automation platform that lets you connect literally any tool—GitHub, Instantly, Apollo, Hunter.io, Stripe, Slack, you name it—and build workflows that use them together. But here's what makes it different: you're not gluing APIs together manually. You're giving an AI agent a mission, connecting it to the tools it needs, and letting it execute on your behalf.\n\nThink of it as an AI-native backend. No infrastructure. No code. No servers to manage.\n\nThe Problem I Was Solving\n\nLast week, I had a product manager ask: \"Can you set up something that pulls all our GitHub changes, figures out what actually matters to our users, and emails them a summary every morning?\"\n\nNormal world? I'd spend two days writing scripts, setting up cron jobs, handling errors, monitoring logs. All for something that takes maybe 2 minutes to describe.\n\nWith Chase Agents? 9am call. 6pm automation live. (This actually happened, and yes, I'm still shocked too.)\n\nThree Things That Make This Actually Work\n\n1. Security That Actually Matters\n\nHere's where most platforms mess up: they need your API keys to work, which means they can see everything. Your Stripe revenue, your customer emails, your private GitHub repos—all visible to whoever runs the platform.\n\nNot with us.\n\nWith Chase Agents, the LLM never sees your API keys. Not once. Your keys stay encrypted on your machine. When the agent needs to call an API, it tells the system what to do, and your secure connection handles it. The AI doesn't have access. The system doesn't have access. Only you do.\n\nI've had security-conscious teams literally pause mid-conversation when I explain this, then immediately sign up. It's that rare to find a tool that doesn't need to spy on your data.\n\n2. Collaboration That Actually Works\n\nOne person building workflows is cool. Five people building workflows together? That's when things get interesting.\n\nYou can invite your whole team into a shared workspace. Everyone can see what automation is running. Everyone can create new workflows. Everyone gets notified when something breaks (which, let's be honest, happens). And because everything's in one place, there's no confusion about which version is live or who changed what.\n\nMy team right now has three people building different workflows in the same space. No merge conflicts. No version control nightmares. Just pure collaboration.\n\n3. Scheduling That Runs While You Sleep\n\nThis is the part that blew my mind.\n\nYou know that GitHub product update automation I mentioned? It runs every single day at 8am. No intervention from me. No manual triggers. It just... works.\n\nSet a schedule. Forget about it. Your AI agent handles it.\n\nI have a workflow that runs every morning, pulls our latest product changes from GitHub, understands what they mean, formats them into something our customers actually care about, and sends an email. All automated. All while I'm sleeping.\n\nThe possibilities here are insane:\n\n• Lead qualification every morning from your CRM\n• Daily competitor analysis across 10 different platforms\n• Weekly email summaries of customer feedback\n• Hourly API health checks with Slack notifications\n• Anything you can describe, your agent can automate\nWhat Makes This Different From... Everything Else?\n\nLook, there are a million automation platforms out there. Zapier, Make.com, whatever else. They're great at connecting two tools. Button → Trigger → Action. Done.\n\nBut what if you need complex logic? What if the workflow involves understanding nuance? What if you need an agent that can think?\n\nThat's where Chase Agents lives.\n\nYou're not limited to \"if X then Y.\" You can say: \"Look at these new GitHub commits, figure out which ones are customer-facing, write a summary that non-technical people will understand, and send it in an email that feels personal.\"\n\nThe agent handles the thinking. You handle the vision.\n\n---- END ----\n\nOkay so there's more in the blog but I don't want to bore you! Comment if you want the link to the full chat including the prompt I used and a download link to the full blog - and definitely check out Chase Agents! It's in a public beta and I would love to see you there.\n",

        "title": "How I built a full-stack SaaS app in 9 weeks as a Product Manager (not a dev). The secret? There is no secret!",
        "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nFor the last 9 weeks, I have been building solo a full-stack AI platform called **Markolé**. It is a tool for brand strategy, and it is now live in beta.\n\nMy background is Product Leader. I have experience in product, dev leadership, design, usability... but I am not a coder. You can say I can *read* code, but I don't really *write* it. So how did I build a modern application with microservices on Kubernetes by myself?\n\nThe secret is that there is no secret. It is all about applying the traditional, almost boring, software development discipline to the AI workflow. You do not find one magic prompt. You have to build a rigorous system.\n\nSo, before I write even one prompt for code, I must do all the upfront work. The \"boring\" work that many people want to skip:\n\n\\*   A highly detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n\n\\*   A full Data Architecture Plan.\n\n\\*   A comprehensive Software Architecture Plan.\n\n\\*   And I document every decision, all the time.\n\nI have spent years in product and engineering leadership, so I have done all this by hand for a long time. I know the rules.\n\nFor the actual development loop, this is my process:\n\n1. First, I use Gemini or ChatGPT as my \"System Architect\". I give it a section of my PRD for an Epic. Because of its large context, it can hold the global view of the codebase. It takes the requirements and breaks down the Epic into a set of 2 to 4 high-level Tasks, and then each Task into 2 to 4 very detailed Steps.\n2. Then, I take these granular Step prompts to Claude or Codex, my \"AI Coder\". Because the work is so precisely defined, Claude is not planning, it is only executing. This is the key. It usually completes all the steps for a full Task in just one or two shots. After, I test, QA, validate.\n3. This next part is maybe the most important to avoid the classic AI project collapse. After a Task is done, the Coder writes a full report, what it did, how, which files were touched. I feed this report *back* to the System Architect for validation against the original PRD. This creates the feedback loop.\n4. If everything is good and checks out, the Coder updates the internal developer documentation. Only then, I commit the code, close the Claude session, and move to the next section of the PRD.\n\nThis process, it may feel a bit heavy, but it is how I can keep full control over a large project and avoid the chaos. It allowed me to build the whole thing by myself in 9 weeks.\n\nI'm happy to answer questions about the system.

Someone recommended me a software called \"Magic cloud\" which seems to do most backend work like connecting the agent to the database and generating endpoints. So i wanna ask is it better if i use it or if i get into fastapi and learn it then make the api and endpoints myself?\n\n\\-And for local database. Someone told me this :\"Sounds like a cool project, but connecting an AI to local desktop apps and databases is gonna be way harder than it looks. Good luck though!\". He suggested the local database be moved to the cloud so the backend can access it. So what do you think about it?\n\n\\-and last question. I hear that getting into node.js and electron is a bit difficult. Do you recommend i use JAVAFX for the UI or is it worth learning react and electron?😁",

        "content": "The most effective way to vibe code is to stay out of the corporate playpens pretending to be “AI workspaces.” Don’t use Replit or any of those glossy all-in-one environments that try to own your brain and your backend.\n\nUse Cosine, Grok, and GPT instead. Let them fight each other while you copy and paste the code into a clean visual sandbox like CodePen or Streamlit. That separation keeps you alert. It forces you to read the code, to see what actually changed. Most fixes are microscopic. You’ll catch them faster in real code than buried behind someone’s animated IDE dashboard.\n\nThis approach keeps you out of dependency traps. Those “free” integrated backends are Trojan horses. Once you’ve built something useful, they’ll charge you for every request or make migration painful enough that you just give up and pay. Avoid that by keeping your code portable and your environment disposable.\n\nWhen you get stuck, switch models. Cosine, Grok, and GPT are like dysfunctional coworkers who secretly compete for your approval. One’s messy, another’s neurotic, but together they balance out. Cosine is especially good at cleaning up code without shattering it. GPT is loose as, but better at creativity. Grok has flashes of inspired weirdness. Rotate through them before you blame yourself.\n\nWhen you’re ready to ship, do it from GitHub via Cloudflare. No sandboxes, no managed nonsense. You’ll get actual scalability, and you’ll understand every moving part of your deployment.\n\nThis approach to vibe coding isn’t anti-autopilot. You’re the interpreter between the models and the machine. Keep your tools dumb and your brain switched on.",

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, today, I want to talk about the new Nvidia Nemotron Nano 2 VL model. People at Nvidia were kind enough to give me early access to this model, and this video is being made in collaboration with them. So, what is this model about? Well, it's an open, efficient multimodal model for document intelligence and video understanding. So, this is a vision-language model that is mainly built for multiple use cases, which are mostly related to OCR. It can efficiently understand text, tables, charts, and diagrams. It is also best in class for OCR and chart reasoning. It's also super efficient compared to before, and can now take in videos as input and use them accordingly. It is a hybrid architecture. It's built upon transformer and mamba hybrid architectures, similar to some previous Nvidia models as well. This, in general, makes it a bit faster and more efficient. It's quite a good jump from the last generation Nemotron Nano VL model. It's not just an OCR model, though. You can also give it images and chat with it about the context of the image, which is quite good. From the testing that I have done, I can say that this is a really good model for almost everything related to vision. And I'll demo some use cases going into the video as well. It's also a hybrid reasoning model. So, you can make it think for harder topics or make it skip reasoning if you want snappier results. Also, this is one of the most open models that you'll see. The model weights themselves are openly available under the Apache 2 license. And the training data set for the model is also openly available. So, this is awesome. This is a 12 billion parameter model. You should be able to grab the weights from hugging face, and its preview should be available on Nvidia Nim and Build platform. So, you can check it out there as well. Their official API is fully Open AI compatible, and you can integrate it into a ton of places. Just some quick heads up as to what you shouldn't expect from this model. The first thing is that it can't do something like computer use or browser automation. This is because the model itself is pretty dense for its size. And training it on pixel-perfect correlations would have been quite challenging. However, since it's open-weight, we might see some community fine-tunes of the model down the line that adapt it for those use cases. That's something I just wanted to quickly mention. So, here's the notebook I've been playing with. It's a colab that wires the Open AI client to Nvidia's endpoint. You point your client at the Nvidia API, drop in your Nvidia API key, and the chat interface works like a regular Open AI style completion. That's it. No weird custom SDK, just the standard shape, which is pretty good. In the system message, you can toggle reasoning with a special token. Send /think for deep reasoning, or /no_think for quicker extractive responses. I like that it's explicit. No guessing if the model is in chain of thought mode. Then, your user content is a list that can mix images, videos, and text. So, you can upload multiple JPEGs and videos via MP4 and add your prompt like sum up totals across the receipts. It streams the response, and if reasoning is on, you'll see the thought content arrive as well. For demos in the notebook, they show a clean PDF Q and A flow. Load pages, convert them to data URLs, and ask a question like, \"How much did Data Center business grow in Q2 FY26?\" With reasoning off and temp 0.0, and it returns the exact figures. That's the crisp use case. Then they flip reasoning on for multi-image, \"Which business unit had the most year-on-year growth?\" It walks through the sections and concludes that Automotive had the highest year-on-year growth. I like this because the workflow is simple and portable. There's also a receipts example, where it sums totals across four images and outputs the final sum after step-by-step math. That's practical, and honestly, something finance ops teams will love. Transitioning from that, let's talk about video. The notebook has a demo where you pass a video URL and ask for a detailed description. When reasoning is off, with temp 0.0, you get a concise, accurate caption with scene details, which is pretty cool. Behind the scenes, the model uses efficient video sampling to drop redundant frames and keep semantics intact, so you can describe longer clips without exploding token usage. It's similar to the kind of compression that something like YouTube does. But it's for the VLM instead, which is pretty interesting. Anyway, that's how it works. Now, let me tell you how you should use it. First of all, if you want to simply use it, then you can just configure it in whatever you like. Their official API works with everything that supports the Open AI compatible API. So, you can configure it in things like Kilo Code, Rue Code, Cline, and stuff like that as well. I generally use the Chatwise app as my daily driver chat app. It's only available on Mac OS, though, but it's free for all the basic features. So, if you want to configure it with that, then just go to the settings, and then in provider, set up the Nvidia endpoint with the API key. Then, just enter the model name and you should be good to go. In Chatwise, make sure that you enable the reasoning and image input options. It works pretty well. You can just send your images, and it responds flawlessly. Generally, you see a lot of bugs in small models. But this one is very stable and just works really well. You can also use Open web UI or John and configure it similarly. This is a vision-language model, so it can do simple talk and stuff as well, which is awesome. I have also been using it for LLM judged evaluations. As you guys know, I have some benchmarks, and I've been constantly developing more. To automate the judgment of the LLMs, I try to have another LLM look at the results. Now that works fine for many things. But for front-end related tasks, I generally try to have a vision LLM that goes through all the pages and summarizes the features it sees on each page. Then, the bigger judge LLM can take that in and check if at least the front end for the requested features is implemented. And then it can score accordingly. I could do it with some bigger models. But they get extremely expensive. However, now I can do something like this. Take a screenshot of the page with the playwright library. Apply that to the Nemotron VLM model. And it will give me a structured output of which features are correctly implemented. Then, the bigger judge model can look at that and score it accordingly. Obviously, this is a niche feature. But many companies run evaluations. And these smaller models allow for more on-device processing. And a pretty good alternative to bigger models. I think most of you might be doing something where this could come in handy. I've also started using this model in my daily coding. Since it's Open AI compatible, you can use something like Kilo Code, which I use. Configure the API there, and you're good to go. It's good enough at tool calling that it doesn't throw errors. I mainly use this model in architect mode. And what that allows me to do is give it a UI design I might want to take inspiration from. And have it summarize the design aspects that the images have. I usually have over 10 to 20 inspirations to build my own design from. So, I can feed those one by one and brainstorm with it to find the aspects I want. And since it can reason, it also allows me to build design plans with it, which I can then give to something like the GLM model that doesn't have vision capabilities. I can probably run this locally as well. But currently, I'm using the API. And having this in a local AI toolkit would also be pretty awesome. You can also use it to build workflows around your tasks, using something like N8N. It's Open AI compatible. So, you can use it for a ton of tasks. For example, you can make a workflow that automatically triggers when a ticket is made and performs an automated review. Helping the customer representative avoid checking each document manually. It's also great for business documents and chart understanding. So, yeah, this is a great model. It's just an awesome model for vision tasks. It's small, simple to use, and just works. So, go ahead and check this model out. I find it pretty great. And let me know what you guys might use it for as well down in the comments. Overall, it's pretty cool.

            "transcription": "Hi, welcome to another video. So, I just read Kilo Code's post saying that Code Supernova is shutting down. And I wanted to go through it a bit because a lot of people use that model, including me at one point. And it's honestly a big change. They start the post by saying Code Supernova was the second most used model on the platform. Which tracks. It's been there for a while and was kind of the go-to option for coding tasks if you didn't want to use the heavier or more expensive models. Now, since it's gone, they're suggesting a few alternatives: one free and one cheap but good. The free one is Grok Code Fast 1, and the cheap one is GPT-5 Mini. So basically, you can either just use Grok alone or pair it with GPT-5 Mini for a hybrid setup. They tested both against Code Supernova using their standard benchmark: a job queue system written in TypeScript with Bun and SQLite. That's a solid choice for comparison since it touches on async logic, persistence, and scheduling. The kind of stuff that's easy to mess up in automated code generation. Anyway, they found that Grok Code Fast 1 performed about the same as Code Supernova but produced cleaner and shorter code. That's good to see, although cleaner is subjective. Depends on how you like your API structured. The example they gave makes sense though. Code Supernova bundled everything into one payload parameter, while Grok separated the job type, data, and delay into their own parameters. That's actually a better API design, easier to extend and debug later. They also mentioned how Grok handles scheduling more simply, using milliseconds directly instead of requiring you to create date objects and convert between Unix and JS timestamps. That's one of those small things that don't sound like a big deal until you're debugging it at 2:00 a.m. They also said Grok automatically parses JSON on retrieval, while Supernova required you to manually parse it unless you were inside the internal flow. That's another quality of life improvement. It's not huge, but it saves you a few lines every time, and that adds up. Both models apparently delivered working implementations, but neither really cared about production features like performance optimization, which is normal for code mode outputs. That's what pushed them to test a hybrid setup: one model for planning, the other for implementation. This is where GPT-5 Mini comes in. They used it in architect mode to plan the whole system, and then Grok Code Fast 1 executed it. It's kind of the same pattern we're seeing everywhere now: one model that does the thinking, another that just does the work. They say the combination worked way better. GPT-5 Mini came up with an actual plan that included retry mechanisms, indexes, migration support, lifecycle management, and even error handling. Then Grok implemented that plan exactly. So, the hybrid result was much more structured than either model working alone. And the cost part is interesting. GPT-5 Mini costs 25 cents per M input tokens and $2 per M output tokens, but with caching, it drops to 2.5 cents per M input tokens. So, depending on how much text you're feeding it, the total cost of generating a whole architecture plan can come out to under a cent. Combined with Grok being free right now, that's basically a zero-cost setup for small to medium tasks. They also mentioned how the hybrid setup took a bit longer, which is expected since it's multi-step, but the results were noticeably better. And yeah, that makes sense. When you give the coding model a plan to follow, it doesn't waste tokens thinking, it just executes. That usually leads to cleaner results and fewer retries. I think the key takeaway they're trying to make is that it's not about replacing Code Supernova one-to-one, it's about splitting the work differently. Instead of one model doing everything halfway well, you use two smaller ones that each do their part better. They even list what kind of developer tasks fit each mode. For smaller edits like add caching, fix a validation bug, or refactor this function, Grok Code Fast 1 is enough. It's fast and predictable. But for bigger stuff like build a notification system or design an API, they recommend using GPT-5 Mini for planning first. That's smart. It mirrors how actual developers work: plan first, then implement. I like that they made that distinction because a lot of AI coding setups still try to do everything in one go, and that's why the results feel inconsistent. Having a split between planning and execution actually makes the workflow more controllable. Then they talk about pricing again, and there's a promo running. If you top up $10, you get $30 worth of credits. That's a nice move to get people to try GPT-5 Mini without worrying about costs. It's also not locked into just one model. It applies to everything on Kilo. The rest of the post covers some small details about how to access both models and a quick mention of their upcoming AMA on Discord. I think that's good timing. People will probably have a lot of questions about how to set up the hybrid flow properly. What I find interesting is that they're calling this a spec-driven or planning-driven workflow, which is something I've talked about before. Except this time, it actually seems a bit more practical. You don't need some big third-party tool. It's all built into Kilo with the architect and code modes. If you've used Code Supernova in the past, this might actually feel like a natural upgrade path. You just have to get used to the two-step process. First, let GPT-5 Mini think through the architecture, then hand that plan off to Grok. Once you get into the rhythm of it, it's basically the same effort as before, but with better results. Overall, the post feels like more than just an announcement. It's not \"Supernova's gone, sorry.\" It's more like, \"Here's what's next, and it might actually be better.\" And honestly, from the examples they shared, it does look like an improvement, especially if you're building mid-size projects or just need reliable one-shot code generation. So yeah, if you were relying on Code Supernova, I'd say it's worth testing Grok Code Fast 1 first. Start small, maybe something you've built before, and see how it compares. And if you find it lacking in planning, then bring GPT-5 Mini into the mix. It's good to see Kilo actually benchmarking, and not just pushing a new model for the sake of it. The results they shared are specific: line counts, API design, even JSON handling. That kind of transparency helps developers make informed choices, and I appreciate that. All right, that's about it for this one. I just wanted to go through the post line by line and give my take. The shift away from Code Supernova might sound bad at first, but the alternatives look solid, especially for the price. Overall, it's pretty cool.
